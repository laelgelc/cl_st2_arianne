Report
The Panel agreed on the outline of the+AKA-2027 IPCC Methodology Report on Carbon Dioxide Removal Technologies, Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (Additional guidance)+AKA-at its 63rd Session held in Lima, Peru from 27-30 October 2025+AKA-(Decision IPCC-LXIII-6).
The report will be a single Methodology Report comprising an Overview Chapter and six volumes consistent with the format of the+AKA-2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories.
The structure of the Methodology Report is consistent with the+AKA-2006 IPCC Guidelines+AKA-so as to make it easier for inventory compilers to use this Methodology Report with the+AKA-2006 IPCC Guidelines.
Topics that will be addressed include:
+ICI- Transport, injection and sequestering of CO2+AKA-in relation to enhanced oil, gas, and coal-bed methane recovery
+ICI- Production of products containing or derived from captured and/or removed CO2
+ICI- Carbonation of cement and lime-based structures
+ICI- Soil carbon sinks and related emissions enhanced through biochar and weathering and other elements
+ICI- Coastal wetlands carbon dioxide removal types not in previous IPCC Guidelines as well as additional information on mangroves, tidal marshes and seagrass in coastal waters
+ICI- Durable biomass products
+ICI- Carbon dioxide capture from combustion and process gases
+ICI- Direct air capture
+ICI- Carbon dioxide utilisation
+ICI- Carbon dioxide transport including cross border issues
+ICI- Carbon dioxide injection and storage
+ICI- CO2+AKA-removal through direct capture of CO2+AKA-from water already processed by inland and coastal facilities+ADs- and
+ICI- related elements across the range of categories of the IPCC Guidelines.
The national greenhouse gas inventory includes sources and sinks occurring within the territory over which a country has jurisdiction.
Over 150 experts are expected to participate in the writing process, which will be completed by 2027.
The participants will be selected by the Task Force Bureau taking into account scientific and technical expertise, geographical and gender balance to the extent possible in line with+AKA-Appendix A+AKA-to the Principles Governing IPCC Work.
The First Lead Authors+IBk- meeting will be held in Rome, Italy, in April 2026.
Preparatory Work
The decision by the Panel to prepare this Methodology Report was informed by the work of experts at the +AKA-scoping meeting+AKA-held in Copenhagen, Denmark, from 14-16 October 2024.+AKA- Prior to the scoping meeting, an+AKA-expert meeting+AKA-was held at Vienna, Austria 1-3 July 2024.
These meetings considered Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) methods mentioned in the AR6 WGIII Report as a starting point for discussion and noted that several CDR activities have been already covered by the existing IPCC Guidelines.
