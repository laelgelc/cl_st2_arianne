INTRODUCTION 
At 
its fifth 
session (Geneva, M a r c h 
1991), 
the 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( I P C C ) 
decided to address the six following tasks in a short-term 
effort to produce an update of its First Assessment Report 
(August 1990):

matters requiring further work) were discussed during the 
seventh session and are included in section VIII of the 
Supplement. 
Publication of the 1992 IPCC Supplement completes the 
short-term work on the six Tasks agreed on at the fifth 
session of the I P C C (IPCC-V). 
Long-term work on the 
same Tasks was also agreed on at I P C C - V and this 
continues. 
Each Working Group presented material consisting of a 
supplement to the IPCC First Assessment Report (1990) 
together with supporting documents. The supplementary 
reports have been prepared by subgroups, and have been 
extensively scrutinized and agreed on by open-ended 
plenary meetings of the three W o r k i n g Groups. The 
supporting documents are being prepared by the Working 
Groups, subgroups or lead authors and have been or will 
be extensively refereed. 
The IPCC, at its seventh session (Geneva, 10-12 February 
1992), recognized with appreciation the dedicated work of 
many scientists in preparing the reports and supporting 
documents, especially considering the short time available 
for their preparation. The IPCC considered and included 
the supplementary reports from the Working Groups as 
contributions to the 1992 I P C C Supplement. 
The IPCC 
requested that any minor inconsistencies between the 
Working Group reports be removed so far as possible. 
Other inconsistencies will be resolved in follow-up work. 
It was noted that the supplementary reports are overviews 
of the work which has been carried out and that the 
supporting documents provide a great deal of additional 
detailed information, and it was requested that these 
documents be made available as soon as possible. Issues 
common to all three working groups as well as other 
issues raised by members of the I P C C (in particular

By Working Group I 
C U R R E N T T A S K 
The fifth session of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
Change (IPCC) (Geneva, March 1991) adopted six tasks for 
the ongoing work of its three working groups. While suc­
cessful completion of these tasks required cooperation 
between all three groups, particular responsibility fell to 
the Scientific Assessment working group (WGI) for Tasks 
I, 2 and 6: 
Task I : 
Assessment of net greenhouse gas emissions. 
Sub-section 1 : Source and sinks of 
greenhouse gases. 
Sub-section 2: Global Warming Potentials. 
Task 2; 
Predictions of the regional distributions of 
climate change and associated impact studies; 
including model validation studies. 
Task 6: 
Emissions scenarios. 
The tasks were divided into long- and short-term compo­
nents. The purpose of the short-term workplan, whose 
results are reported in the present document, was to provide 
an update to the 1990 IPCC Scientific Assessment, address­
ing some of the key issues of that report. This update is by 
definition less comprehensive than the 1990 assessment - for 
example sea level rise apart from the effect of thermal 
expansion is not included. It is against the background of 
that document that the findings of this update should be 
read. 
This assessment, in order to incoфorate as much recent 
material as possible, necessarily includes discussion of new 
results which have not yet been through, or are currently 
undergoing, the normal process of peer review. Where such 
is the case the provisional nature of the results has been 
taken into account. 
A brief progress report on the preparation of guidelines for 
the compilation of national inventories of greenhouse gas 
emissions, part of WGI's long-term work under Task 1, 
appears as an Annex to this Supplement. 
OUR M A J O R CONCLUSIONS 
Findings of scientific research since 1990 do not affect our 
fundamental understanding of the science of the green­
house effect and either confirm or do not justify alteration 
of the major conclusions of the first I P C C Scientific 
Assessment, in particular the following: 
emissions resulting from human activities are 
substantially 
increasing 
the 
atmospheric 
concentrations of the greenhouse gases: carbon 
dioxide, methane, chlorofluorocarbons, and nitrous 
oxide; 
the evidence from the modelling studies, from 
observations and the sensitivity analyses indicate 
that the sensitivity of g l o b a l mean 
surface 
temperature to doubling C O , is unlikely to lie 
outside the range 1.5° to 4.5°C; 
there are many uncertainties in our predictions 
particularly with regard to the timing, magnitude 
and regional patterns of climate change due to our 
incomplete understanding; 
• 
global mean surface air temperature has increased 
by 0.3° to 0.6°C over the last 100 years; 
the size of this warming is broadly consistent with 
predictions of climate models, but it is also of the 
same magnitude as natural climate variability. Thus 
the observed increase could be largely due to this 
natural variability; altematively this variability and 
other human factors could have offset a still larger 
human-induced greenhouse warming; 
• 
the u n e q u i v o c a l detection of the 
enhanced 
greenhouse effect from observations is not likely 
for a decade or more. 
There are also a number of significant new findings and con­
clusions which we summarize as follows: 
Gases and aerosols 
• 
Depletion of ozone in the lower stratosphere in the 
middle and high latitudes results in a decrease in 
radiative f o r c i n g w h i c h 
is b e l i e v e d to 
be 
comparable in magnitude to the radiative forcing 
contribution of c h l o r o f l u o r o c a r b o n s 
( C F C s ) 
(globally-averaged) over the last decade or so.

The cooling effect of aerosols* resulting from 
sulphur emissions may have offset a significant part 
of the greenhouse 
w a r m i n g in the Northern 
Hemisphere (NH) during the past several decades. 
Although this phenomenon was recognized in the 
1990 report, some progress has been made in 
quantifying its effect. 
The Global Warming Potential ( G W P ) remains a 
useful concept but its practical utility for many 
gases depends on adequate quantification of the 
indirect effects as well as the direct. W e now 
recognize that there is increased uncertainty in the 
calculation of G W P s , particularly in the indirect 
components and, whilst indirect G W P s are likely to 
be significant for some gases, the numerical 
estimates in this Supplementary Report are limited 
to direct G W P s . 
Whilst the rates of increase in the atmospheric 
concentrations of many greenhouse gases have 
continued to grow or remain steady, those of 
methane and some halogen compounds have 
slowed. 
Some data indicate that g l o b a l emissions of 
methane from rice paddies may amount to less than 
previously estimated. 
Scenarios 
Steps 
have 
been 
taken 
towards 
a 
more 
comprehensive analysis of the dependence of future 
greenhouse gas emissions on socio-economic 
assumptions and projections. A set of updated 
scenarios have been developed for use in modelling 
studies which describe a wide range of possible 
future emissions in the absence of coordinated 
policy response to climate change. 
Modelling 
• 
Climate models have continued to improve in 
respect of both their physical realism and their 
ability to simulate present climate on large scales, 
and new techniques are being developed for the 
simulation of regional climate. 
Transient (time-dependent) 
simulations with 
coupled ocean-atmosphere models ( C G C M s ) , in 
which neither aerosols nor ozone changes have 
been included, suggest a rate of global warming that 
is consistent, within the range of uncertainties, with 
the 0.3°C per decade wanning rate quoted by IPCC 
(1990) for Scenario A of greenhouse gas emissions. 
The large-scale geographical patterns of warming 
produced by the transient mode! runs with C G C M s 
are generally similar to the patterns produced by the 
earlier equilibrium models except that the transient 
simulations show reduced w a r m i n g over the 
northern North Atlantic and the southern oceans 
near Antarctica. 
C G C M s are capable of reproducing some features 
of atmospheric variability on intra-decadal time-
scales. 
Our understanding of some climate feedbacks and 
their incoфoration in the models has improved. In 
particular, there has been some clarification of the 
role of upper tropospheric water vapour. The role of 
other processes, in particular cloud effects, remains 
unresolved. 
Climate observations 
The a n o m a l o u s l y high global mean 
surface 
temperatures of the late 1980s have continued into 
1990 and 1991 which are the warmest years in the 
record. 
A v e r a g e w a r m i n g over parts of the Northern 
Hemisphere mid-latitude continents has been found 
to be largely characterized by increases in minimum 
(night-time) rather than m a x i m u m (daytime) 
temperatures. 
Radiosonde data indicate that the lower troposphere 
has warmed over recent decades. Since meaningful 
trends cannot be assessed over periods as short as a 
decade, the widely reported disagreements between 
decadal trends of air temperature from satellite and 
surface data cannot be confirmed because the trends 
are statistically indistinguishable. 
The volcanic eruption of Mount Pinatubo in 1991 is 
expected to lead to transitory 
stratospheric 
warming. With less certainty, because of other 
natural influences, surface and tropospheric cooling 
may occur during the next few years. 
Average warming over the Northern Hemisphere 
during the last four decades has not been uniform, 
with marked seasonal and geographic variations; 
this warming has been especially slow, or absent, 
over the extratropical north west Atlantic. 
The consistency between observations of global 
temperature changes over the past century and 
model simulations of the w a r m i n g due 
to 
greenhouse gases over the same period is improved 
if allowance is made for the increasing evidence of

a c o o l i n g effect due to sulphate aerosols and 
stratospheric ozone depletion. 
The above conclusions have implications for future pro-
jections of global warming and somewhat modify the 
estimated rate of warming of 0.3°C per decade for the green-
house gas emissions Scenario A of the I P C C First 
Assessment Repon (1990). If sulphur emissions continue to 
increase, this warming rate is likely to be reduced, signifi-
cantly in the Northem Hemisphere, by an amount dependent 
on the future magnitude and regional distribution of the 
emissions. Because sulphate aerosols are very short-lived in 
the atmosphere their effect on global warming rapidly 
adjusts to increases or decreases in emissions. It should 
also be noted that while partially offsetting the greenhouse 
warming, the sulphur emissions are also responsible for 
acid rain and other environmental effects. There is a further 
small net reduction likely in the rate of global warming 
during the next few decades due to decreases in stratospher-
ic ozone, partially offset by increases in tropospheric ozone. 
Research carried out since the 1990 IPCC assessment has 
served to improve our appreciation of key uncertainties. 
There is a continuing need for increased monitoring and 
research into climate processes and modelling. This must 
involve, in p'articular, strengthened international collabora-
tion through the World Climate Research Programme 
( W C R P ) , 
the 
International 
Geosphere 
Biosphere 
Programme (IGBP) and the Global Climate Observing 
System (GCOS). 
How does the climate system work, and 
what information do we need to estimate 
future changes? 
How does the climate system work? 
The Earth absorbs radiation from the Sun, mainly 
at the surface. This energy is then redistributed 
by the atmosphere and ocean and re-radiated to 
space at longer ( ' t h e r m a l ' , 'terrestrial" or 
"infrared") wavelengths. Some of the thermal 
radiation is absorbed by radiatively-active 
('greenhouse') gases in the 
atmosphere, 
p r i n c i p a l l y water vapour, but also carbon 
dioxide, methane, the C F C s , ozone and other 
greenhouse gases. The absorbed energy is re-
radiated in all directions, downwards as well as 
upwards such that the radiation that is eventually 
lost to space is from higher, colder levels in the 
atmosphere (see diagram below). The result is 
that the surface loses less heat to space than it 
would do in the absence of the greenhouse gases 
and consequently stays warmer than it would 
otherwise be. This phenomenon, which acts 
rather like a 'blanket" around the Earth, is known 
as the greenhouse effect. 
What factors can change climate? 
Any factor which alters the radiation received from the 
Sun or lost to space, or which alters the redistribution of 
energy within the atmosphere, and between the atmo-
sphere, land and ocean, will affect climate. 
The Sun's output of energy is known to change by small 
amounts over an 11 -year cycle, and variations over longer 
periods may occur. On time-scales of tens to thousands 
of years, slow variations in the Earth's orbit have led to 
changes in the seasonal and latitudinal distribution of 
solar radiation; these changes have played an important 
part in controlling the variations of past climate. 
Increases in the concentration of the greenhouse gases 
will reduce the efficiency with which the Earth cools to

space and will tend to warm the lower atmosphere and 
surface. The amount of warming depends on the size of 
the increase in concentration of each greenhouse gas, 
the radiative properties of the gases involved, and the 
concentration of other greenhouse gases already present 
in the atmosphere. It also can depend on local effects such 
as the variation with height of the concentration of the 
greenhouse gas. a consideration that may be particularly 
germane to water vapour which is not uniformly mixed 
throughout the atmosphere. The effect is not a simple one 
and the balance which is struck between these factors 
depends on many aspects of the climate system. 
Aerosols (small particles) from volcanoes, emissions of 
sulphates from industry and other sources can absorb 
and reflect radiation. Moreover, changes in aerosol con-
centrations can alter cloud reflectivity through their effect 
on cloud properties. In most cases aerosols tend to cool 
climate. In general, they have a much shorter lifetime than 
greenhouse gases so their concentrations respond much 
more quickly to changes in emissions. 
Any changes in the radiative balance of the Earth, includ-
ing those due to an increase in greenhouse gases or in 
aerosols, will tend to alter atmospheric and oceanic tem-
peratures and the associated circulation and weather 
patterns. However climate varies naturally on all time-
scales due to both external and internal factors. To 
distinguish man-made climate variations from those nat-
ural changes, it is necessary to identify the man-made 
"signal' against the background 'noise' of natural cli-
mate variability. 
A necessary starting point for the prediction of changes 
in climate due to increases in greenhouse gases and 
aerosols is an estimate of their future concentrations. 
This requires a knowledge of both the strengths of their 
sources (natural and man-made) and also the mecha-
nisms of their eventual removal from the atmosphere 
(their sinks). The projections of future concentrations 
can then be used in climate models to estimate the cli-
matic response. We also need to determine whether or not 
the predicted changes will be noticeable above the natu-
ral variations in climate. Finally, observations are 
essential in order to monitor climate, to study climatic 
processes and to help in the development and validation 
of models. 
RECENT IMPROVEMENTS IN 
SCIENTIFIC UNDERSTANDING 
HOW HAS OUR UNDERSTANDING OF 
THE SOURCES AND SINKS OF 
GREENHOUSE GASES AND AEROSOLS 
CHANGED? 
During the last eighteen months there have been a number 
of important advances in our understanding of greenhouse 
gases and aerosols. These advances include an improved 
quantitative understanding of the atmospheric distributions, 
trends, sources and sinks of greenhouse gases, their pre-
cursors and aerosols, and an improved understanding of the 
processes controlling their global budgets. 
Atmospheric concentrations and trends of long-lived 
greenhouse gases: The atmospheric concentrations of the 
major long-lived greenhouse gases [carbon dioxide (CO,), 
methane (CH^), nitrous oxide (N,0), chlorofluorocarbons 
(CFCs), and carbon tetrachloride (CCI4)] continue to 
increase because of human activities. While the growth 
rates of most of these gases have been steady or increasing 
over the past decade, that of C H ^ and some of the halocar-
bons has been decreasing. The rate for CH4 has declined 
from about 20 ppbv/yr in the late 1970s to possibly as low 
as 10 ppbv/yr in 1989. While a number of hypotheses have 
been forwarded to explain these observations, none is com-
pletely satisfactory. 
Atmospheric concentrations and trends of other gases 
that influence the radiative budget: Ozone (O3) is an 
effective greenhouse gas both in the stratosphere and in the 
troposphere. Significant decreases have been observed dur-
ing the last one to two decades in total column O3 at all 
latitudes - except the tropics - in spring, summer and win-
ter. The downward trends were larger during the 1980s than 
in the 1970s. These decreases have occurred predominant-
ly in the lower stratosphere (below 25km). where the rate of 
decrease has been up to 10% per decade depending on alti-
tude. In addition, there is evidence to indicate that O3 levels 
in the troposphere up to 10km altitude above the few exist-
ing ozonesonde stations at northern middle latitudes have 
increased by about 10% per decade over the past two 
decades. Also, the abundance of carbon monoxide (CO) 
appears to be increasing in the N H at about 1% per year. 
However, there is little new information on the global trends 
of other tropospheric O3 precursors, (non-methane hydro-
carbons ( N M H C ) and oxides of nitrogen (NO^^)). 
Sources and sinks of carbon dioxide: The two primary 
sources of the observed increase in atmospheric C O , are 
combustion of fossil fuels and land-use changes: cement 
production is a further important source. 
The emission of C O , from the combustion of fossil fuels 
grew between 1987 "and 1989. Preliminary data for 1990 
indicate similar emissions to 1989. The best estimate for 
global fossil fuel emissions in 1989 and 1990 is 6.0+0.5 
GtC*, compared to 5.7±0.5 G t C in 1987 (IPCC, 1990). The 
/ GiC (¡iigalonne of tarhnn) equals one billion jone thousand million ( 10^)] tonnes of carbon 
9 

estimated total release of carbon in the form of C O , from oil 
well fires in Kuwait during 1991 was 0.065 GtC. about one 
percent of total annual anthropogenic emissions. 
The direct net flux of C O , from land use changes (primar-
ily deforestation), integrated over time, depends upon the 
area of land deforested, the rate of reforestation and 
afforestation, the carbon density of the original and replace-
ment forests, and the fate of above-ground and soil carbon. 
These and other factors are needed to estimate annual net 
emissions but significant uncertainties exist in our quanti-
tative knowledge of them. Since IPCC ( 1990) some progress 
has been made in reducing the uncertainties associated with 
the rate of deforestation, at least in Brazil. A comprehensive, 
multi-year, high spatial resolution satellite data set has been 
used to estimate that the average rate of deforestation in the 
Brazilian Amazonian forest between 1978 and 1989 was 2.1 
million hectares (Mha) per year. The rate increased between 
1978 and the mid-1980s, and has decreased to 1.4 Mha/yr 
in 1990. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), 
using information supplied by individual countries, recent-
ly estimated that the rate of global tropical deforestation in 
closed and open canopy forests for the period 1981-1990 
was about 17 Mha/yr, approximately 50% higher than in the 
period 1976-1980. 
Despite the new information regarding rates of deforesta-
tion, the uncertainties in estimating C O , emissions are so 
large that there is no strong reason to revise the IPCC 1990 
estimate of annual average net flux to the atmosphere of 
1.6+1.0 G t C from land-use change during the decade of 
the 1980s. 
Since I P C C (1990) particular attention has focussed on 
understanding the processes controlling the release and 
uptake of C O , from both the terrestrial biosphere and the 
oceans, and on the quantification of the fluxes. Based on 
models and the atmospheric distribution of C O , , it appears 
that there is a small net addition of carbon to the atmo-
sphere from the equatorial region, a combination of 
outgassing of C O , from warm tropical waters and a terres-
trial biospheric component that is the residual between large 
sources (including deforestation) and sinks. There appears 
to be a strong Northem Hemisphere sink, containing both 
oceanic and terrestrial biospheric components, and a weak 
Southern Hemisphere (SH) sink. The previous IPCC glob-
al estimate for an ocean sink of 2.0±0.8 G t C per year is still 
a reasonable one. The terrestrial biospheric processes which 
are suggested as contributing to the sinks are sequestration 
due to forest regeneration, and fertilization arising from the 
effects of both C O , and nitrogen (N), but none of these can 
be adequately quantified. This implies that the imbalance (of 
order 1-2 GtC/yr) between sources and sinks, i.e., "the miss-
ing sink", has not yet been resolved. This fact has significant 
consequences for estimates of future atmospheric C O j con-
centrations and the analysis of the concept of the 
Greenhouse Warming Potential. 
Sources of methane: A total (anthropogenic plus natural) 
annual emission of C H ^ of about 500Tg can be deduced 
from the magnitude of its sinks combined with its rate of 
accumulation in the atmosphere. While the sum of the indi-
vidual sources is consistent with a total of 500Tg C H ^ , there 
are still many uncertainties in accurately quantifying the 
magnitude of emissions from individual sources. Significant 
new information includes a revised rate of removal of C H ^ 
by atmospheric hydroxy 1 (OH) radicals (because of a lower 
rate constant), a new evaluation of some of the sources 
(e.g., from rice fields) and the addition of new sources (e.g., 
animal and domestic waste). Recent C H ^ isotopic studies 
suggest that approximately lOOTg C H ^ (20% of the total 
CH4 source) is of fossil origin, largely from the coal, oil, and 
natural gas industries. Recent studies of C H ^ emissions 
from rice agriculture, in particular Japan, India, Australia, 
Thailand and China, show that the emissions depend on 
growing conditions, particularly soil characteristics, and 
vary significantly. While the overall uncertainty in the mag-
nitude of global emissions from rice agriculture remains 
large, a detailed analysis now suggests significantly lower 
annual emissions than reported in IPCC 1990. The latest 
estimate of the atmospheric lifetime of C H ^ is about 11 
years. 
Sources of nitrous oxide: Adipic acid (nylon) produc-
tion, nitric acid production and automobiles with three-way 
catalysts have been identified as possibly significant anthro-
pogenic global sources of nitrous oxide. However, the sum 
of all known anthropogenic and natural sources is still bare-
ly sufficient to balance the calculated atmospheric sink or to 
explain the observed increase in the atmospheric abundance 
of N , 0 . 
Sources of halogenated species: The worldwide con-
sumption of C F C s 11, 12, and 113 is now 40% below 1986 
levels, substantially below the amounts permitted under the 
Montreal Protocol. Further reductions are mandated by the 
1990 London Amendments to the Montreal Protocol. As 
C F C s are phased out. H C F C s and HFCs will substitute, but 
at lower emission rates. 
Stratospheric ozone depletion: Even if the control mea-
sures of the 1990 London amendments to the Montreal 
Protocol were to be implemented by all nations, the abun-
dance of stratospheric chlorine and bromine will increase 
over the next several years. The Antarctic ozone hole, 
caused by industrial halocarbons, will therefore recur each 
spring. In addition, as the weight of evidence suggests that 
these gases are also responsible for the observed reductions 
in middle- and high-latitude stratospheric O3. the depletion 
at these latitudes is predicted to continue unabated through 
the 1990s. 
Sources of precursors of tropospheric ozone: Little new 
information is available regarding the tropospheric ozone 
precursors (CO, N M H C . and N0,^ ), all of which have sig-
nificant natural and anthropogenic sources. Their detailed 
budgets therefore remain uncertain. 
Sources of aerosols: Industrial activity, biomass buming, 
volcanic eruptions, and sub-sonic aircraft contribute sub-
10 

stantially to the formation of tropospheric and stratospher-
ic aerosols. Industrial activities are concentrated in the 
Northern Hemisphere where their impact on tropospheric 
sulphate aerosols is greatest. Sulphur emissions, which are 
due in large part to combustion effluents, have a similar 
emissions history to that of anthropogenic C O , . Estimates 
of emissions of natural sulphur compounds have been 
reduced from previous figures, thereby placing more empha-
sis on the anthropogenic contribution. 
SCENARIOS OF FUTURE EMISSIONS 
Scenarios of net greenhouse gas and aerosol precursor emis-
sions for the next 100 years or more are necessary to support 
study of potential anthropogenic impacts on the climate 
system. The scenarios provide inputs to climate models and 
assist in the examination of the relative importance of rel-
evant trace gases and aerosol precursors in changing 
atmospheric composition and climate. Scenarios can also 
help in improving the understanding of key relationships 
among factors that drive future emissions. 
Scenario outputs are not predictions of the future, and should 
not be used as such: they illustrate the effect of a wide 
range of economic, demographic and policy assumptions. 
They are inherently controversial because they reflect dif-
ferent views of the future. The results of short-term 
scenarios can vary considerably from actual outcomes even 
over short time horizons. Confidence in scenario outputs 
decreases as the time horizon increases, because the basis for 
the underiying assumptions becomes increasingly specula-
tive. Considerable uncertainties surround the evolution of 
the types and levels of human activities (including eco-
nomic growth and structure), technological advances, and 
human responses to possible environmental, economic and 
institutional constraints. Consequently, emission scenarios 
must be constructed carefully and used with great caution. 
Since completion of the 1990 IPCC Scenario A (SA90) 
events and new information have emerged which relate to 
that scenario's underlying assumptions. These develop-
ments include: the London Amendments to the Montreal 
Protocol; revision of population forecasts by the Worid 
Bank and United Nations; publication of the IPCC Energy 
and Industry Sub-group scenario of greenhouse gas emis-
sions to 2025; political events and economic changes in the 
former USSR, Eastem Europe and the Middle East; re-esti-
mation of sources and sinks of greenhouse gases (reviewed 
in this Assessment): revision of preliminary F A O data on 
tropical deforestation; and new scientific studies on forest 
biomass. There has also been recognition of considerable 
uncertainty regarding other important factors that drive 
future emissions. 
These factors have led to an update of the SA90. Six alter-
native IPCC Scenarios (IS92 a-f) now embody a wide array 
of assumptions, summarized in Table 1, affecting how future 
greenhouse gas emissions might evolve in the absence of cli-
mate policies beyond those already adopted. This constitutes 
a significant improvement over the previous methodology. 
However, the probability of any of the resulting emission 
paths has not been analyzed. IPCC W G I does not prefer any 
individual scenario. Other combinations of assumptions 
could illustrate a broader variety of emission trajectories. 
The different wodds which the new scenarios imply, in 
terms of economic, social and environmental conditions, 
vary widely. The current exercise provides an interim view 
and lays a basis for a more complete study of future emis-
sions of greenhouse gas and aerosol precursors.

Scenario results: The range of possible greenhouse gas 
futures is very wide, as the Figure below illustrates (show­
ing only CO,). A l l six scenarios can be compared to SA90. 
IS92a is slightly lower than SA90 due to modest and large­
ly offsetting changes in the underlying assumptions. (For 
example, compared to SA90, higher population forecasts 
increase the emission estimates, while phaseout of halo-
carbons and more optimistic renewable energy costs reduce 
them.) The highest greenhouse gas levels result from the 
new scenario IS92e which combines, among other assump­
tions, moderate population growth, high economic growth, 
high fossil fuel availability and eventual hypothetical phase-
out of nuclear power. The lowest greenhouse gas levels 
result from IS92c which assumes that population grows, 
then declines by the middle of the next century, that eco­
nomic growth is low and that there are severe constraints on 
fossil fuel supplies. The results of all six scenarios appear 
in Table 2. Overall, the scenarios indicate that greenhouse 
gas emissions could rise substantially over the coming cen­
tury in the absence of new measures explicitly intended to 
reduce their emission. However. IS92c has a C O , emission 
path which eventually falls below its staning 1990 level. 
IS92b, a modification of IS92a, suggests that current com­
mitments by many O E C D Member countries to stabilize or 
reduce C O , might have a small impact on greenhouse gas 
emissions over the next few decades, but would not offset 
substantial growth in possible emissions in the long run. 
IS92b does not take into account that such commitments 
could accelerate development and 'aiffusion of low green­
house gas technologies, nor possible resulting shifts in 
industrial mix. 
Carbon dioxide: The new emissions scenarios for C O , 
from the energy sector span a broad range of futures (see 
Figure below).

Population and economic growth, structural changes in 
economies, energy prices, technological advance, fossil fuel 
supplies, nuclear and renewable energy availability are 
among the factors which could exert major influence on 
future levels of C O , emissions. Developments such as those 
in the republics of the former Soviet Union and in Eastem 
Europe, now incoфorated into all the scenarios, have impor­
tant implications for future fossil fuel carbon emissions, by 
affecting the levels of economic activities and the efficien­
cy of energy production and use. Biotic carbon emissions in 
the early decades of the scenarios are higher than SA90, 
reflecting higher preliminary F A O estimates of current rates 
of deforestation in many - though not all - parts of the world, 
and higher estimates of forest biomass.

Halocarbons: The revised scenarios for CFCs and other 
substances which deplete stratospheric ozone are much 
lower than m SA90. This is consistent with wide participa­
tion in the controls under the 1990 London Amendments to 
the Montreal Protocol. However, the future production and 
composition of C F C substitutes (HCFCs and HFCs) could 
significantly affect the levels of radiative forcing from these 
compounds. 
Methane, nitrous oxide, ozone precursors and sulphur 
gases: The distribution of C H ^ and N , 0 emissions from the 
different sources has changed from the SA90 case. Methane 
from rice paddies are lower, and emissions from animal 
waste and domestic sewage have been added. N-,0 emission 
factors for stationary sources and biomass burning have 
been revised downwards. Adipic and nitric acid have been 
included as additional sources of N , 0 . Preliminary analy­
sis of the emissions of volatile organic compounds and 
sulphur dioxide suggests that the global emissions of these 
substances are likely to grow in the coming century if no 
new limitation strategies are implemented. 
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN EMISSIONS 
AND ATMOSPHERIC 
CONCENTRATIONS AND THE 
INFLUENCE ON RADIATIVE BUDGET 
A key issue is to relate emissions of greenhouse gases, 
greenhouse gas precursors and aerosol precursors to future 
concentrations of greenhouse gases and aerosols in order to 
assess their impact on the radiative balance. A number of 
different types of model have been developed. 
Carbon cycle models: While there is a variety of carbon 
cycle models (including 3-D ocean-atmosphere models, 1-
D ocean-atmosphere box-diffusion models, and box models 
that 1псофога1е a terrestrial biospheric sink) all such mod­
els are subject to considerable uncertainty because of an 
inadequate understanding of the processes controlling the 
uptake and release of C O , from the oceans and terrestrial 
ecosystems. Some models assume a net neutral terrestrial 
biosphere, balancing fossil fuel emissions of C O , by ocean­
ic uptake and atmospheric accumulation, others achieve 
balance by invoking additional assumptions regarding the 
effect of C O , fertilization on the different pans of the bio­
sphere. However even models that balance the past and 
contemporary carbon cycle may not predict future atmo­
spheric concentrations accurately because they do not 
necessarily represent the proper mix of processes on land 
and in the oceans. The differences in predicted changes in 
C O , concentrations are up to 30%. This does not represent 
the major uncertainty in the prediction of future climate 
change compared with uncertainties in estimating future 
pattems of trace gas emissions, and in quantifying climate 
feedback processes. A simple empirical estimate can be 
based on the assumption that the fraction of emissions which 
remains in the atmosphere is the same as that observed over 
the last decade; i.e., 46±7%. 
Atmospheric gas phase chemistry models: Current tro­
pospheric models exhibit substantial differences in their 
predictions of changes in O3, in the hydroxyl radical (OH) 
and in other chemically active gases due to emissions of 
CH4, non-methane hydrocarbons, C O and, in particular, 
NOjj. These arise from uncertainties in the knowledge of 
background chemical composition and our inability to rep­
resent small-scale processes 
occurring within 
the 
atmosphere. These deficiencies limit the accuracy of pre­
dicted changes in the abundance and distribution of 
tropospheric O3, and in the lifetimes of a number of other 
greenhouse gases, including the H C F C s and HFCs, all of 
which depend upon the abundance of the O H radical. 
Increases in C H ^ , N M H C s , and C O all lead to increases in 
O3. and decreases in O H , thus leading to an increase in 
radiative forcing. On the other hand because increases in 
NOx lead to an increase in both O3 and O H , the net effect 
on radiative forcing is uncertain. 
Atmospheric sulphate aerosol models: The atmospheric 
chemistry of sulphate aerosols and their precursors has been 
extensively studied in relation to the acid rain issue. While 
our understanding of processes related to chemical trans­
formations has increased significantly in recent years, 
substantial uncertainties remain, especially regarding the 
microphysics of aerosol formation, interaction of aerosols 
with clouds, and the removal of aerosol particles by pre­
cipitation. 
HOW HAS OUR UNDERSTANDING OF 
CHANGES IN RADIATIVE FORCING 
CHANGED? 
Since IPCC (1990), there have been significant advances in 
our understanding of the impact of ozone depletion and 
sulphate aerosols on radiative forcing and of the limitations 
of the concept of the Global Warming Potential. 
Radiative forcing due to changes in stratospheric ozone: 
For the first time observed global depletions of O3 in the 
lower stratosphere have been used to calculate changes in 
the radiative balance of the atmosphere. Although the results 
are sensitive to atmospheric adjustments, and no G C M stud­
ies of the implications of the O3 changes on surface 
temperature have been performed, the radiative balance cal­
culations indicate that the O3 reductions observed during the 
1980s have caused reductions in the radiative forcing of the 
surface-troposphere system at mid- and high- latitudes. This 
reduction in radiative forcing resulting from O3 depletion 
could, averaged on a global scale and over the last decade, 
be approximately equal in magnitude and opposite in sign 
to the enhanced radiative forcing due to increased CFCs dur­
ing the same time period. The effect at high latitudes is 
particularly pronounced and, because of these large varia­
tions with latitude and region, studies using G C M s are 
urgently required to further test these findings 
Radiative forcing due to changes in tropospheric ozone: 
While there are consistent observations of an increase in tro-
15 

pospheric ozone (up to 10% per decade) at a limited num-
ber of locations in Europe, there is not an adequate global 
set of observations to quantify the magnitude of the increase 
in radiative forcing. However, it has been calculated that a 
10% uniform global increase in tropospheric ozone would 
increase radiative forcing by about a tenth of a watt per 
square metre. 
Radiative effects of sulphur emissions: Emissions of sul-
phur compounds from anthropogenic sources lead to the 
presence of sulphate aerosols which reflect solar radiation. 
This is likely to have a cooling influence on the Northern 
Hemisphere (there is negligible effect in the Southern 
Hemisphere). For clear-sky conditions alone, the cooling 
caused by current rates of emissions has been estimated to 
be about 1 Wm-2 averaged over the Northem Hemisphere, a 
value which should be compared with the estimate of 
2.5Wm-2 for the heating due to anthropogenic greenhouse 
gas emissions up to the present. The non-uniform distribu-
tion of anthropogenic sulphate aerosols coupled with their 
relatively short atmospheric residence time produce large 
regional variations in their effects. In addition, sulphate 
aerosols may affect the radiation budget through changes in 
cloud optical properties. 
Global Warming Potentials: Gases can exert a radiative 
forcing both directly and indirectly: direct forcing occurs 
when the gas itself is a greenhouse gas; indirect forcing 
occurs when chemical transformation of the original gas 
produces a gas or gases which themselves are greenhouse 
gases. The concept of the Global Warming Potential (GWP) 
has been developed for policymakers as a measure of the 
possible warming effect on the surface-troposphere system 
arising from the emission of each gas relative to C O , . The 
indices are calculated for the contemporary atmosphere and 
do not take into account possible changes in chemical com-
position of the atmosphere. Changes in radiative forcing due 
to C O , , on a kg basis, are non-linear with changes in the 
atmospheric C O , concentrations. Hence, as C O j levels 
increase from present values, the G W P s of the non-COj 
gases would be higher than those evaluated here. For the 
concept to be most useful, both the direct and indirect com-
ponents of the G W P need to be quantified. 
Direct Global Warming Potentials: The direct compo-
nents of the Global Warming Potentials (GWPs) have been 
recalculated, taking into account revised estimated life-
times, for a set of time horizons ranging from 20 to 500 
years, with C O , as the reference gas. The same ocean-atmo-
sphere carbon cycle model as in IPCC (1990) has been used 
to relate C O , emission to concentrations. Table 3 shows val-
ues for a selected set of key gases for the 100 year time hori-
zon. While in most cases the values are similar to the 
previous I P C C (1990) values, the G W P s for some of the 
H C F C s and H F C s have increased by 20 to 50% because of 
revised estimates of their lifetimes. The direct G W P of C H ^ 
has been adjusted upward, correcting an error in the previ-
ous IPCC report. The carbon cycle model used in these 
calculations probably underestimates both the direct and 
indirect G W P values for all non-COj gases. The magnitude 
of the bias depends on the atmospheric lifetime of the gas, 
and the G W P time horizon.

Indirect Global Warming Potentials: Because of our 
incomplete understanding of chemical processes, most of 
the indirect G W P s reported in IPCC (1990) are likely to be 
in substantial error, and none of them can be recommend-
ed. Although we are not yet in a position to recommend 
revised numerical values, we know, however, that the indi-
rect G W P for methane is positive and could be comparable 
in magnitude to its direct value. In contrast, based on the 
sub-section above, the indirect G W P s for chlorine and 
bromine halocarbons are likely to be negative. The concept 
of a G W P for short-lived, in homogeneously distributed 
constituents, such as C O , N M H C , and N O , may prove inap-
plicable, although, as noted above, we know that these 
constituents will affect the radiative balance of the atmo-
sphere through changes in tropospheric ozone and O H . 
Similarly, a G W P for S O , is viewed to be inapplicable 
because of the non-uniform distribution of sulphate aerosols. 
Influence of changes in solar output: The existence of 
strong correlations between characteristics of the solar activ-
ity cycle and global mean temperature has been reported. 
The only immediately plausible physical explanation of 
these correlations involves variability of the sun's total irra-
diance on time-scales longer than that of the 11-year activity 
cycle. Since precise measurements of the irradiance are 
only available for the last decade, no firm conclusions 
regarding the influence of solar variability on climate change 
can be drawn. 
WHAT TOOLS DO WE USE AND WHAT INFORMATION DO WE NEED TO 
PREDICT FUTURE CLIMATE? 
Models 
The most highly developed tool which we have to model 
climate and climate change is known as a general circu-
lation model or G C M . These models are based on the 
laws of physics and use descriptions in simplified phys-
ical terms (called parametrizations) of the smaller-scale 
processes such as those due to clouds and deep mixing in 
the ocean. ' C o u p l e d ' general circulation models 
16 

( C G C M s ) have the atmospheric component linked to an 
oceanic component of comparable complexity. 
Climate forecasts are derived in a different way from 
weather forecasts. A weather prediction model gives a 
description of the atmosphere's state up to 10 days or so 
ahead, starting from a detailed description of an initial 
state of the atmosphere at a given time. Such forecasts 
describe the movement and development of large weath-
er systems, though they cannot represent very small-scale 
phenomena; for example, individual shower clouds. 
To estimate the influence of greenhouse gases or aerosols 
in changing climate, the model is first run for a few (sim-
ulated) decades. The statistics of the model's output are 
a description of the model's simulated climate which, if 
the model is a good one and includes all the important 
forcing factors, will bear a close resemblance to the cli-
mate of the real atmosphere and ocean. The above 
exercise is then repeated with increasing concentrations 
of the greenhouse gases or aerosols in the model. The dif-
ferences between the statistics of the two simulations 
(for example in mean temperature and interannual vari-
ability) provide an estimate of the accompanying climate 
change. 
We also need to determine whether or not the predicted 
changes will be noticeable above the natural variations in 
climate. Finally, observations are required in order to 
monitor climate, to improve the understanding of cli-
mate processes and to help in the validation of models. 
The long-term change in surface air temperature follow-
ing a doubling of carbon dioxide (referred to as the 
climate sensitivity) is generally used as a benchmark to 
compare models. The range of values for climate sensi-
tivity reported in the 1990 Assessment, and re-affinmed 
in this Supplement, was 1.5° to 4.5°C, with a best esti-
mate, based on model results and taking into account the 
observed climate record, of 2.5°C. 
Simpler models, which simulate the behaviour of G C M s . 
are also used to make predictions of the evolution with 
time of global temperature from a number of emission 
scenarios. These so-called box-diffusion models contain 
highly simplified physics but give similar results to 
G C M s when globally averaged. Only comprehensive 
G C M s , however, can provide three-dimensional distri-
butions of the changes in other climate variables, 
including the changes due to non-linear processes that are

models to simulate present climate, although further 
improvements in the model resolution and the parametriza-
tion of physical processes are needed. Since the last report, 
further evidence has accumulated that atmospheric models 
not given by simplified models. The extraction of this 
information from the results of coupled G C M s has only 
just begun. 
Future concentrations of greenhouse gases and 
aerosols 
A necessary starting point for the prediction of changes 
in climate due to changes in atmospheric constituents is 
an estimate of their future concentrations. This requires 
a knowledge of their sources and sinks (natural and man-
made) and an estimate of how the strengths of these 
sources and sinks might change in the future (an emis-
sions scenario). The projections of future concentrations 
can then be used in climate models to estimate the cli-
matic response. 
Do GCMs predict future climate? 
To make a prediction of future climate it is necessary to 
fulfil two conditions: (a) include all of the major human 
and natural factors known to affect climate, and (b) pre-
dict the future magnitudes of atmospheric concentrations 
of greenhouse gases. So far, G C M s (and C G C M s ) have 
included only radiative forcing induced by greenhouse 
gases, and therefore their results relate only to the green-
house gas component of climate change. 
At the time of IPCC (1990), it was recognized that sul-
phate aerosols exert a significant negative radiative 
forcing on climate but this forcing was not well quanti-
fied. Since then progress has been made in understanding 
radiative forcing by sulphate aerosols, and an additional 
source of negative forcing has been identified in the 
depletion of stratospheric ozone due to halocarbons. The 
lack of these negative forcing factors in G C M s does not 
negate the results obtained from them so far. For exam-
ple the estimates of climate sensitivity, which is defined 
purely in terms of C O j concentrations, are unchanged, 
and it is still believed that anthropogenic greenhouse 
gases, now and even more so in the future, represent the 
largest perturbation to the natural radiative balance of the 
atmosphere. However it does mean that the rates of 
change of, say, surface temperature do need to be adjust-
ed for additional forcing factors before they can fulfil 
condition (a). The second condition is fulfilled when we 
use a specific prediction (as opposed to a scenario) of 
future atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases. 
are capable of reproducing a range of aspects of atmo-
spheric variability. Coupled ocean-atmosphere models 
produce variability on decadal time-scales similar m some 
respects to that observed, and ocean models show longer 
term fluctuations associated with changes in the thermoha-
line circulation. 
17 

There has been some clarification of the nature of water 
vapour feedback, although the radiative effects of clouds and 
related processes continue to be the major source of uncer­
tainty and there remain uncertainties in the predicted 
changes in upper tropospheric water vapour in the tropics. 
Biological feedbacks have not yet been taken into account 
in simulations of climate change. 
Increased confidence in the geographical patterns of cli­
mate change will require new simulations with improved 
coupled models and with radiative forcing scenarios that 
include aerosols. 
Confidence in regional climate patterns based directly on 
G C M output remains low and there is no consistent evi­
dence regarding changes in variability or storminess. G C M 
results can be lnteфolated to smaller scales using statistical 
methods (correlating regional climate with the large-scale 
flow) or a nested approach (high-resolution, regional climate 
models driven by large-scale G C M results). Both methods 
show promise but an insufficient number of studies have yet 
been completed to give an improved global picture of 
regional climate change due to increases in greenhouse 
gases; in any event both inteфoIation methods depend crit­
ically on the quality of the large-scale flow in the G C M . 
Given our incomplete knowledge of climate, we cannot 
rule out the possibility of suфrises. 
S I M U L A T E D R A T E S O F C H A N G E IN C L I M A T E 
AND THEIR G E O G R A P H I C A L DISTRIBUTION 
Results of General Circulation Models (GCMs) available to 
IPCC (1990) mainly concerned eqiiilihnum simulations. 
Only one transieni model run (i.e., where the time-varying 
response of the climate to steadily increasing greenhouse gas 
concentrations is simulated) had been completed. 
Since then many papers have appeared in the refereed lit­
erature concerned with climate models and their results. 
Significant progress has been made in the area of transient 
models, with four modelling groups having carried out cli­
mate simulations for up to 100 years using coupled 
atmosphere-ocean global climate models ( C G C M s ) which 
шсофогаге a detailed description of the deep ocean and 
therefore can simulate the climate lag induced by the deep 
ocean circulation. These models require substantial adjust­
ments to fluxes of heat and fresh water in order to achieve 
a realistic simulation of present climate and this may distort 
the models' response to small perturbations such as those 
associated with increasing greenhouse gases. For simula­
tions of future climate with these models, carbon dioxide 
concentrations have been increased at rates close to 1 % per 
year (approximately the equivalent radiatively to the current 
rate of increase of greenhouse gases). 
Internal variability obscures the geographical pattems of 
change during the first few decades of the experiments. 
However, once these pattems become established, they vary 
relatively little as the integrations progress and are similar 
to those produced by equilibrium models in a number of 
ways for instance: 
(i) 
surface air temperatures increase more over land 
than over oceans; 
(u) 
precipitation increases on average at high latitudes, 
in the monsoon region of Asia and in the winter at 
mid-latitudes; 
(iii) 
over some mid-latitude continental areas values 
of soil moisture are lower on average in summer. 
The transient C O , simulations, however, show that over 
the northem North Atlantic and the southern oceans near 
Antarctica the warming is reduced by 60% or more relative 
to equilibrium simulations at the time of doubling C O , . 
Much further development and validation of coupled mod­
els IS required. 
W H A T W O U L D W E N O W E S T I M A T E FOR 
C L I M A T E C H A N G E ? 
The new simulations using coupled ocean-atmosphere 
G C M s , which do not include the effects of sulphates and 
ozone depletion, generally confirm the IPCC 1990 esti­
mates of future warming at rates of about 0.3°C/decade 
(range 0.2 to 0.5°C/decade) over the next century for IPCC 
1990 scenario A . Because G C M s do not yet include possi­
ble opposing anthropogenic influences, including the forcing 
from sulphate aerosols and stratospheric ozone depletion, 
the net rate of increase in surface temperature is expected to 
be less, at least during the period for which sulphur emis­
sions continue to increase, than would be expected from 
greenhouse gas forcing alone. However, the globally aver­
aged magnitude of the effect of sulphate aerosols has not yet 
been calculated accurately and further work is needed. 
The simulated rate of change of sea level clue to oceanic 
thermal expansion only ranges from 2 to 4cm per decade, 
again consistent with the previous report. 
New ГРСС 1992 emissions scenarios (IS92a-f; see para, on 
• S C E N A R I O S O F F U T U R E E M I S S I O N S " ) have been 
derived in the light of new information and intemational 
agreements. In order to provide an initial assessment of the 
effect of the new scenarios, the change in surface tempera­
ture has been estimated with the simple climate model used 
in IPCC (1990) which has been calibrated against the more 
comprehensive coupled ocean-atmosphere models (see box 
on models). These calculations include, in the same way as 
did the 1990 calculations, the direct radiative forcing effects 
of all the greenhouse gases included in the scenarios. 
The effect of stratospheric ozone depletion and of sulphate 
aerosols have not been included, which again parallels the 
1990 calculations. The accompanying diagrams show (i) the 
temporal evolution of surface temperature for IS92a, assum­
ing the high, "best estimate" and low climate sensitivities 
(4.5,2.5 and 1.5°C), and (ii) the temperature changes for the 
six 1992 IPCC scenarios and the 1990 Scenario A , assum­
ing the "best estimate" of climate sensitivity (see earlier box 
on "What tools do we use ....?" for the definition of climate 
sensitivity).

THE UPDATED RECORD OF GLOBAL 
MEAN TEMPERATURES 
Continuing research into the 19th century ocean temperature 
record has not significantly altered our calculation of surface 
temperature warming over the past 100-130 years of 
0.45±0.15°C. Furthermore, global surface temperatures for 
1990 and 1991 have been similar to those of the warmest 
years of the 1980s and continue to be warmer than the rest 
of the record. The research has, however, led to a small 
adjustment in hemispheric temperatures. The long-term 
warming trends assessed in each hemisphere are now more 
nearly equal, with the Southern Hemisphere marginally 
warmer in the late nineteenth century and the Northem 
Hemisphere trend unchanged from previous estimates. 
A notable feature over considerable areas of the continen­
tal land masses of the Northem Hemisphere is that warming 
over the last few decades is primarily due to an increase of 
night-time rather than daytime temperatures. These changes 
appear to be partly related to increases in cloudiness but 
other factors cannot be excluded such as a direct cooling 
effect of aerosols on maximum temperatures in sunny 
weather, an influence of increasing concentrations of green­
house gases and some residual influence of urbanisation on 
minimum temperatures. A more complete study is needed 
as only 25% of the global land area has been analysed. In 
this regard, regional changes in maximum, minimum and 
mean temperature related to changes in land use (e.g., deser­
tification, deforestation or widespread irrigation) may need 
to be identified separately. 
A new source of information that supports higher sea sur­
face temperatures in many tropical regions over the last 
decade concerns evidence that the bleaching of tropical 
corals has apparently increased. Bleaching has been shown 
to be related (in part) to episodes of sea surface temperature 
warmer than the normal range of tolerance of these animals, 
though increasing pollution may be having an influence. 
There has been considerable interest in mid-tropospheric 
temperature observations made since 1979 from the 
Microwave Sounding Unit ( M S U ) aboard the T I R O S - N 
satellites. The M S U data have a truly global coverage but 
there is only a short record ( 13 years) of measurements; the 
surface and the radiosonde data are less spatially complete 
but have much longer records (over 130 and near 30 years 
respectively). Globally-averaged trends in M S U , radiosonde 
and surface data sets between 1979 and 1991 differ some­
what (0.06, 0.17, and 0.18°C per decade, respectively), 
although the differences are not statistically significant. 
Satellite sounders, radiosonde and surface instruments all 
have different measurement characteristics, and, in addition, 
geographical and temporal variations in mid-tropospheric 
and surface temperatures are not expected to be identical. 
Despite this, correlations between global annual values of 
the three data sets are quite high. 
Note that it is not possible to rank recent warm years in an 
absolute way; it depends on which record is used, what 
level is referred to and how much uncertainty is attached to 
each value. 
M S U data have been able to detect the impact on lower 
stratospheric temperature of volcanic eruptions in a striking 
way. Variability m these data between 1979 and 1991 is 
dominated by short-term temperature fluctuations (greatest 
in the tropics) following the injection of large amounts of 
aerosol into the stratosphere by the eruptions of El Chichón 
(1982) and Mt. Pinatubo (1991). Globally, temperature rises 
m the lower stratosphere were about 1 °C and 1.3°C respec-
tively; stratospheric warming due to E l Chichón lasted 
nearly two years while that due to Mt. Pinatubo is still 
underway. The longer radiosonde record, however, shows 
a significant global cooling trend of about 0.4°C per decade 
since the middle 1960s in the lower stratosphere. 
ARE THERE ANY TRENDS IN OTHER 
CLIMATICALLY IMPORTANT 
QUANTITIES? 
Precipitation variations of practical significance have been 
documented on many time and space scales, but due to data 
coverage and inhomogeneity problems nothing can be said 
about global-scale changes. A n apparent increase of water 
vapour in the tropics parallels the increase in lower tropo-
spheric temperature but it is not yet possible to say to what 
19 

extent the changes are real and whether they are larger than 
natural variability. 
A small, irregular, decrease of about 8% has been observed 
in annually averaged snow cover extent over the Northem 
Hemisphere since 1973 in a new. improved, compilation of 
these data. The reduction is thought to be real because annu-
al values of snow cover extent and surface air temperatures 
over the extratropical Northem Hemisphere land have a 
high correlation of -0.76. 
There is evidence that, regionally, relatively fast (some-
times called abrupt) climate changes can occur. 
These 
changes may persist for up to several decades but are often 
a function of season. These fast changes are poorly under-
stood, but can be of considerable practical importance. 
ARE THE OBSERVED TEMPERATURE 
CHANGES CONSISTENT WITH 
PREDICTED TEMPERATURE CHANGES? 
C G C M s , which do not yet take into account changes in 
aerosols, predict a greater degree of warming in the Northem 
Hemisphere (NH) than in the Southem Hemisphere (SH). a 
result of the greater extent of land in the N H which responds 
more rapidly to forcing. The observed larger warming of the 
SH in recent decades (0.3°C between 1955 and 1985) than 
in the N H (which hardly warmed at all over the same peri-
od) is at first sight in conflict with this prediction. Recently, 
however, the N H has started to warm quite rapidly. The rea-
sons for the differences in observed warming rates in the two 
hemispheres are not known though man-made aerosols (see 
para, on " H O W H A S O U R U N D E R S T A N D I N G 
?) and 
changes in ocean circulation may have played a part. 
Furthermore, increases in C F C s may have reduced ozone 
levels sufficiently to offset in a globally-averaged sense the 
direct greenhouse effect of C F C s . Consequently, the esti-
mates of wanning over the last 100 years due to increases 
in greenhouse gases made in the original report may be 
somewhat too rapid because they did not take account of 
these cooling influences. Taking this into account could 
bring the results of model simulations closer to the observed 
changes. 
Individual volcanic eruptions, such as that of El Chichón, 
may have led to surface cooling over several years but should 
have negligible effect on the long-term trend. Some influence 
of solar variations on time-scales associated with several 
sunspot cycles remains unproven but is a possibility. 
The conclusion of IPCC (1990) remains unchanged: 
"the size of this warming is broadly consistent with predic-
tions of climate models, hut it is also of the same magnitude 
as natural climate variability. Thus the observed increase 
could he largely due to this natural variability; alternative-
ly this variability and other human factors could have offset 
a still larger human-induced greenhouse warming". 
KEY UNCERTAINTIES AND FURTHER 
WORK REQUIRED 
The prediction of future climate change is critically depen-
dent on scenarios of future anthropogenic emissions of 
greenhouse gases and other climate forcing agents such as 
aerosols. These depend not only on factors which can be 
addressed by the natural sciences but also on factors such as 
population and economic growth and energy policy where 
there is much uncertainty and which are the concem of the 
social sciences. Natural and social scientists need to coop-
erate closely in the development of scenarios of future 
emissions. 
Since IPCC (1990) there has been a greater appreciation of 
many of the uncertainties which affect our predictions of the 
timing, magnitude and regional pattems of climate change. 
These continue to be rooted in our inadequate understand-
ing of: 
• 
sources and sinks of greenhouse gases and aerosols 
and their atmospheric concentrations (including 
their indirect effects on global warming) 
clouds (particularly their feedback effect on 
greenhouse gas-induced global warming, also the 
effect of aerosols on clouds and their radiative 
properties) and other elements of the atmospheric 
water budget, including the processes controlling 
upper level water vapour 
oceans, which through their thermal inertia and 
possible changes in circulation, influence the timing 
and pattern of climate change 
polar ice sheets (whose response to climate change 
also affects predictions of sea level rise) 
land surface processes and feedbacks, including 
hydrological and ecological processes which couple 
regional and global climates 
Reduction of these uncertainties requires: 
improvements in the systematic observation and 
understanding of climate-forcing variables on a 
global basis, including solar irradiance and aerosols 
development of comprehensive observations of the 
relevant variables describing all components of the 
climate system, i n v o l v i n g as required new 
technologies and the establishment of data sets 
• 
better understanding of climate-related processes, 
particularly those associated with clouds, oceans 
and the carbon-cycle 
an improved understanding of social, technological 
and economic processes, especially in developing 
countries, that are necessary to develop more 
realistic scenarios of future emissions 
20 

the development of national inventories of current 
emissions 
more detailed knowledge of climate changes which 
have taken place in the past 
• 
sustained and increased support for climate research 
activities which cross national and disciplinary 
boundaries; particular action is still needed to 
facilitate the full involvement of d e v e l o p i n g 
countries 
improved international exchange of climate data. 
Many of these requirements are being addressed by major 
intemational programmes in particular by the World Climate 
Research Programme (WCRP), the Intemational Geosphere 
Biosphere Programme (IGBP) and the Global Climate 
Observing System (GCOS). Adequate resources need to be 
provided both to the intemational organisation of these pro-
grammes and to the national efforts supporting them if the 
new information necessary to reduce the uncertainties is to 
be forthcoming. Resources also need to be provided to sup-
port on a national or regional basis, and especially in 
developing countries, the analysis of data relating to a wide 
range of climate variables and the continued observation of 
important variables with adequate coverage and accuracy.

ANNEX 
Progress in the development of an IPCC methodology 
for national inventories of net emissions of greenhouse 
gases 
Scientific assessment is primarily concerned with sources 
and sinks at the global, and large region level but, in order 
to support national and intemational responses to climate 
change, it is necessary to estimate emissions and sinks at the 
national level in an agreed and consistent way. 
IPCC (1991) has established a work programme to: 
i) 
develop an approved detailed methodology for cal-
culating national inventories of greenhouse gas 
emissions and sinks 
ii) 
assist all participating countries to implement this 
methodology and provide results by the end of 
1993. 
This programme is based on preliminary work sponsored by 
the 
Organization for 
Economic Cooperation 
and 
Development ( O E C D , 1991). O E C D and the Intemational 
Energy Agency ( l E A ) are continuing to provide technical 
support to the IPCC work programme. The programme will 
manage the development and approval of inventory meth-
ods and procedures, and the collection and evaluation of 
data. It will collaborate with other sponsors including the 
Global Environment Facility (GEF), the Asian Development 
Bank, the European Community, U N E C E and individual 
donor countries, to encourage funding of technical cooper-
ation projects in greenhouse gas (GHG) inventories. 
The I P C C requested that participating countries provide 
any available G H G emissions inventory data to the IPCC by 
the end of September 1991. As of January 1992, 18 coun-
tries have submitted complete or partial G H G inventories 
(see Table below); most relate to average emissions over 
one, two or three years in the period 1988 to 1990. This pro-
cess has been particularly useful in identifying problems in 
coverage and consistency of currently available inventories. 
A n IPCC Workshop on National G H G Inventories, held in 
Geneva from 5-6 December 1991, provided guidance on 
needed improvements in the draft methodology and priori-
ties for the work programme. Numerous improvements to 
the methodology were agreed upon, and priorities were pro-
posed for the work programme and for technical cooperation 
activities. As a result of the preliminary data collection, the 
workshop, and other comments received, the following 
major priorities for the IPCC work programme have been 
established: 
Methodology 
Develop a simpler methodology and streamlined 
•'workbook" document lo assist users in its 
implementation 
Work with experts to develop a new and simpler 
method for calculating C O , emissions from forestry 
and land-use change 
Establish technical expert groups to improve the 
methodology for C H 4 from rice and fossil fuel 
production, and other key gases and source types 
Work with experts to include halocarbons in the 
G H G inventory starting with data available from 
the Montreal Protocol process 
Develop and disseminate regionally-applicable 
emissions factors and assumptions. 
Work programme 
Priorities for national inventories are: (a) C O , from 
energy for all countries, (b) C O , from forestry and 
land use if important for the country, and (c) CH4 
for important source categories by country 
Initiate intercomparison studies of existing detailed 
inventories 
Include a scientific review of national inventory 
data and aggregated totals by region and globally in 
the work programme. 
Technical cooperation

activities to assist n o n - O E C D countries in testing 
and implementing the G H G inventory methodology

IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE

BY WORKING GROUP II 
Introduction 
Working Group II examined aspects of four of the tasks 
approved at the fifth session of IPCC (March 1991). These 
tasks include: 
• 
prediction of the regional distributions of climate 
change and associated impacts studies, including 
model validation studies; 
• 
energy and Industry related issues; 
• 
agriculture and Forestry related issues; 
• 
vulnerability to sea level rise. 
The first of these includes the development of guidelines for 
assessment 
of impacts, and the 
identification of 
regional/national components of monitoring systems which 
could be used for impact studies. 
Also included here is additional work on water resources and 
hydrology, a subject mentioned most frequently as the area 
of maximum concern by nations in response to a question-
naire circulated by the Working Group (and on other topics 
related to the structure of the Working Group itselO- The 
work reported focuses only on the portions of these tasks 
that directly relate to the impacts of climate change. 
Since the I P C C First Impacts Assessment Report (1990), 
studies have been included which have served to extend 
our knowledge of the potential impacts of climate change. 
These, however, do not radically alter the conclusions 
despite uncertainties of that report. 
From the stimulus provided by the publication of the IPCC 
First Impacts Assessment Report, a large number of region-
al studies have been carried out on assessment of impacts of 
climate change. 
A questionnaire circulated by Working 
Group II was valuable in revealing new information, and in 
defining areas of common concem to many countries. Thus, 
roughly 50% of the responses highlighted the impacts of cli-
mate change on hydrology and water resources, emphasizing 
the importance of water in most countries. Other topics of 
priority interest, particularly for developing countries, were 
agriculture and forestry, and world's oceans and coastal 
zones. Both reflect the concems of countries over avail-
ability of food supplies from land and sea sources. 
Additional areas of concem identified in the questionnaire 
were desertification (particularly in Africa and Asia), 
cyclones and other extreme events (particularly for island 
nations and deltaic areas), recreation and tourism (particu-
larly their economic impacts), and climate variability 
associated with the El-Nino - Southem Oscillation (ENSO) 
phenomenon, prolonged droughts and extreme events. The 
national responses included concem that changes in cli-
mate variability as a consequence of climate change may 
create increased risks, especially in those parts of the world 
where climate variability is known to have significant social 
and economic impacts. It is important to note that many 
countries, particularly in the Southem Hemisphere, also 
identified increases in U V - B radiation as a significant area 
of concem. 
T H E E N E R G Y , H U M A N S E T T L E M E N T , 
T R A N S P O R T AND INDUSTRIAL S E C T O R S , 
H U M A N H E A L T H AND AIR Q U A L I T Y 
Recent studies for the Maldives and for the Pacific island 
states including Tuvalu, Kiribati, Tokelau and the Marshall 
Islands have reconfirmed that small low-lying island states 
and large populations living in low-lying coastal areas will 
be increasingly vulnerable, particularly if adaptive mea-
sures are inadequate, to the combination of sea level rise, 
storm surges and coastal flooding. 
The high dependency on biomass and hydropower in many 
developing countries indicates that these countries are quite 
sensitive to the impacts of climate change. Biomass pro-
duction, on which developing countries such as Bangladesh 
depend for 90 to 100% of their energy needs, could be dam-
aged by a combination of climate-change-induced drought 
or inundation. 
On the other hand, there has been little work that has shed 
new light on the question of socio-economic impacts in the 
areas of energy, human settlement, transport and industrial 
sectors, human health and air quality. 
A U K study shows soil shrinkage and swelling as a result of 
climate change in clay-rich areas has major implications for 
the construction and insurance industries and for human 
settlement. Water-dependent industries such as food pro-
cessing, paper making, and power generation could be 
affected by hydrological changes under changed climate 
conditions.

Knowledge of climate change on human health has extend-
ed and confirmed the previously reported results with 
greater understanding of potential shifts in disease vector 
habitats with global warming particularly in New Zealand 
and Australia. Diseases such as malaria, lymphatic filari-
ases. schistosomiasis, leishmaniasis, onchocerciasis (river 
blindness), dengue fever, and Australian and Japanese 
encephalitis could increase or be reintroduced in many 
countries as a consequence of global warming. Regarding 
the impact of U V - B radiation on health, recent studies show 
that it affects human immunosuppression system and vision. 
A G R I C U L T U R E AND F O R E S T R Y 
New studies, such as those in the European Community, 
North America, and Southeast Asia highlight the IPCC First 
Impacts Assessment Report (1990) conclusions that impacts 
will vary greatly depending on the extent of climate change 
and on the type of agriculture. These findings largely ampli-
fy, but do not radically alter, the conclusions made in the 
1990 report. They do, however, confirm that the impact of 
global warming on agriculture may be serious if wanning is 
at the upper end of the range projected by the IPCC Working 
Group I. 
Recent studies have reinforced concern that drought is the 
area in which climate change poses the greatest risk for 
agriculture and consequently arid and semi-arid regions are 
likely to be most vulnerable to climate change. 
Other recent studies confirm the IPCC earlier conclusions 
that climate change may benefit ecological conditions for 
insect growth and abundance which is likely to have a neg-
ative effect on crop, livestock and forest production in some 
regions. 
Research continues to address the relative importance of 
direct and indirect effects of C O , , in combination with a rise 
in temperatures, on future crop production. While some 
scientists emphasize enhanced photosynthesis and more 
efficient water use seen in controlled settings, others are 
sceptical that these benefits will be seen in farmer's fields 
under changing climate conditions. 
The effects on plant growth may result in the maintenance 
of present-day soil conditions in some regions, as greater 
soil organic matter and denser ground cover may counter the 
effects of soil erosion caused by increased rainfall intensi-
ties and oxidation rates of organic matter in soils caused by 
higher temperatures. 
Adaptation to climate change by the existing agricultural 
production system should be possible, and the woridwide 
systems of agricultural research should be able to provide 
new crop cultivars that maintain high yields and nutritional 
quality. However, efforts will be needed to make such devel-
opments available to small farmers in developing countries 
in time to respond to changes in local climatic conditions. 
New analyses support the 1990 report conclusion that the 
impacts of climate change on forests could have significant 
socio-economic consequences. This is especially important 
for those countries and regions where economic and social 
welfare and economic development are highly dependent on 
the forest sector. 
Key uncertainties require continued data collection and 
research for policy development and decision-making. 
These include: (1) the extent of managed and natural forests, 
their spatial and temporal variation and their roles in the 
global carbon cycle; (2) genetics and physiology of tree 
species and the relationships among subordinate and com-
petitive species; (3) regional impacts; and, (4) the linkages 
among the regional impacts, socio-economic structures, and 
the thresholds and critical limits where changes take place. 
N A T U R A L T E R R E S T R I A L E C O S Y S T E M S 
Analyses subsequent to those included in the IPCC First 
Assessment Report ( 1990) reinforce the major conclusion of 
that report that natural terrestrial ecosystems could face sig-
nificant environmental impacts as a result of the global 
increases in the atmospheric concentration of greenhouse 
gases and associated climatic changes. In particular, these 
studies continue to suggest that the rate of these changes will 
be the major factor in determining the type and degree of 
impacts with a variety of responses expected for different 
regions and for different communities within ecosystems. 
Current climatic projections continue to suggest that the 
rates of change are likely to be faster than the ability of some 
component species to respond and that species and ecosys-
tem responses may be sudden, potentially leading to 
ecosystem destabilization or degradation. 
The promotion of heightened public awareness of the gen-
eral values of natural terrestrial ecosystems is essential to 
gaining public support for sustaining these ecosystems in a 
changing climate. Particular emphasis should be placed on 
involving ecosystem managers and local people in the 
assessment of the impacts, consequences and response 
strategies. 
One of the major issues regarding the impacts of climate 
change on terrestrial ecosystems is water availability with 
recent studies suggesting that while water use efficiency of 
vegetation could increase in an enriched C O , atmosphere, 
the same amount of water per unit soil area may be neces-
sary because of increased leaf area ratios due to greater 
biomass produced in that enriched atmosphere. 
Projected climate changes are expected to result in an accel-
erated reduction of tropical forest on the African continent 
and an encroachment of the Sahel syndrome into the savan-
nas. These changes could worsen the already precarious 
production systems in the affected regions of Africa, further 
stressing the associated natural ecosystems and component 
species. Degradation of wetlands and shallow lakes (e.g., 
within savanna ecosystems in Africa and within the Great 
Plains of North America) as a result of projected decreases 
in rainfall or soil moisture could adversely impact on resi-
dent animals and migratory species. 
25 

With projected chrnate change, profound impacts, both ben-
eficial and destructive, can be expected for the distribution 
and productivity of valuable fisheries and the industries 
associated with them. The added stresses to freshwater 
ecosystems as a result of climate change can be expected to 
reduce species numbers and genetic diversity within fresh-
water populations in the short term. With warming, a longer 
growing season could lead to greater fish productivity where 
temperature is currently limiting factor. 
Uncertainties and gaps in the knowledge base continue to 
exist in terms of our understanding of the environmental 
impacts and associated socio-economic consequences of 
climate changes. National, regional and global efforts need 
to cooperatively focus on reducing these deficiencies which 
primarily exist as a result of the lack of sufficient informa-
tion and data on: a) fundamental ecological processes; b) the 
links between climate and atmospheric chemistry on the 
one hand and the response of natural terrestrial ecosystems 
and their component species on the other; and c) the links 
between natural tenestrial ecosystem changes and social 
and economic welfare under a changing climate. In partic-
ular, there is a lack of information on the sensitivity of 
these ecosystems and their component species to climate 
change, the vulnerability of social and economic systems to 
ecosystem changes, and thresholds/critical levels for these 
ecosystems and associated social and economic systems. 
Existing intemational programmes such as G E M S and M A B 
can provide one means of examining these deficiencies. 
W O R L D O C E A N S AND C O A S T A L ZONES: 
E C O L O G I C A L E F F E C T S 
Since the IPCC First Impacts Assessment Report (1990), 
new studies reconfirm that rising sea level is of more con-
cern in low-lying coastal ecosystems than rising water 
temperatures. 
However, the combination of sea level and 
temperature rise, along with changes in precipitation and 
U V - B radiation, are expected to have strong impacts on 
marine ecosystems, including redistributions and changes in 
biotic production. 
The impact of sea level rise depends on the total net rise 
resulting from the relative vertical movements of the land 
and of the sea. In areas undergoing natural eustatic uplift-
ing of the land due to tectonic plate movement, glacial 
rebound, and vulcanism, there will be little relative rise of 
sea level. In land areas that are naturally falling as in the 
southeastern U S A , due to tectonic and compaction forces, 
impacts of sea level rise will be more important. A new 
study of the Bering Sea indicates that in areas without nat-
ural land uplift, there could be important impacts where 
there is a high density of marine organisms dependent on 
certain types of on-shore and near-shore marine environ-
ments that may be affected by sea level 
change. 
Nevertheless, sea level rise is of far less consequence in 
northem areas than are other impacts of climate change to 
northem ecosystems and to global carbon cycling. These 
regions are very important in the global carbon cycle and a 
small temperature rise may cause significant increases in 
bioproductivity and in carbon flux to the oceans. 
Coral organisms grow 1-20 cm/year and reef growth rates 
as a whole are known to be up to 1.5 cm/year. Not all reefs 
accumulate at these rates, but most should keep pace with 
the expected rise in sea level if other factors do not alter 
growth conditions. Stress on the reefs from other variables 
(storms, sedimentation, disease, rainfall, radiation, turbidi-
ty, overfishing, mass mortality in algal grazers, etc.) may 
prevent some reefs from keeping pace with rising sea level, 
resulting in changes to nearshore hydrodynamics. 
With respect to temperature rise, marine organisms in the 
tropics live closer to their maximum thermal tolerance than 
those in more temperate climates. Although a 1-2°C tem-
perature rise would raise the summertime mean temperature 
to over 30°C over much of the tropical/subtropical region, 
most migratory organisms are expected to be able to toler-
ate such a change. Temperature rise may trigger bleaching 
events in some corals, but it is expected that the other stress-
es mentioned above will be more important. 
Intertidal plants, such as mangroves, can withstand high 
temperature, and unless temperature rise affects reproduc-
tion, it is unlikely to have any effect. Because mangroves 
grow best in moderately saline environments, mangroves 
can probably keep pace with sea level rise in rainfed humid 
areas, but may be overstepped and abandoned in more arid 
areas, particulariy if inland retreat is not possible. Thus, 
future changes in pattems of rain and runoff and of over-
cutting may be more important than sea level rise. With 
respect to marshes, new studies indicate that mid-latitude 
plants seem to tolerate salinity better and are more produc-
tive under elevated C O j . 
New findings of W M O / U N E P indicate that U V - B radiation 
reaching oceanic and coastal zone environments will 
increase faster than expected when the first Report was 
written. Since so many marine resources spend all or vul-
nerable parts of their lives near the water surface, there is a 
significant threat to some fisheries. The first Report 
expressed concem about leaching of contaminants during 
sea level rise, from coastal waste disposal sites. There are 
also bacteria and viral agents in such sites and in coastal sep-
tic sewerage systems which could be increasingly released 
into coastal waters. There are potential impacts on coastal 
resources, but the primary concem is for the humans who 
consume them and the loss of commerce due to the closure 
of fish and shellfish areas by health authorities. Lastly, 
potential changes in storm frequency or intensity could 
have important ecological consequences to coastal 
resources. 
H Y D R O L O G Y AND W A T E R R E S O U R C E S 
Since the publication of the IPCC First Impacts Assessment 
Report (1990), a number of studies on impacts of climate 
change on hydrology and water resources have been con-
ducted. Unfortunately, there is not yet adequate information 
on regions affected by aridity and desertification, and an 
effort should be undertaken to fill that gap. The new stud-
ies expanded on the geographic scope of the original 
26 

surveys, but few new insights were offered on hydrologie 
sensitivities and vulnerability of existing water resources 
management systems, while confirming many previous con-
clusions. 
The principal conclusions suggested by the new studies are: 
• 
S i g n i f i c a n t progress 
has 
been 
made 
in 
hydrologie sensitivity analyses in developed 
countries, yet large gaps exist in the information 
base regarding the implications of climate 
change for less developed nations; 
• 
Comparative sensitivity analyses that rely on 
existing G C M s offer generic insights regarding 
the physical h y d r o l o g i e effects and water 
resources 
management 
impacts, but 
the 
differences in the outputs of the G C M s coupled 
with large differences in hydrologie sensitivity 
analyses makes it difficult to offer region-
specific impact assessments. 
• 
Temporal streamflow characteristics in virtually 
all regions exhibited greater variability and 
amplification of extremes, with larger flood 
volumes and peak flows as well as increased low 
flow episodes and a shift in the tuming of the 
seasonal runoff; 
• 
The higher the degree of water c o n t r o l , 
regulation and management of sectoral water 
demands, the smaller the anticipated adverse 
effects of global w a r m i n g . 
C o n v e r s e l y , 
unregulated hydrologie systems are more 
vulnerable to potential hydrologie alterations; 
The principal recommendations are: 
• 
Increased variability of floods and droughts will 
require a re-examination of engineering design 
assumptions, 
operating 
rules, 
system 
optimization, and contingency planning for 
existing and planned water 
management 
systems; 
• 
More studies on hydrologie .sensitivity and water 
resource management vulnerability need to be 
focused in arid and semi-arid regions and small 
island states. 
• 
A uniform approach to the climate change 
hydrologie sensitivity analyses needs to be 
developed for comparability of results. 
C R Y O S P H E R E 
Analyses continue to support the conclusion that projected 
changes in climate associated with enhanced atmospheric 
concentrations of greenhouse gases are expected to sub-
stantially reduce the areal extent and volume of seasonal 
snow cover, mountain glaciers, terrestrial ice sheets and 
frozen ground including permafrost and seasonally frozen 
ground. 
Recent analyses have shed some further light on the poten-
tial impacts for these elements of the terrestrial cryosphere. 
• 
Analysis of satellite-derived snow cover data has 
shown that the extent of northern hemispheric 
snow to be at record low levels since the middle 
of 1987 with the largest negative anomalies 
occurring in the Spring. 
• 
Above normal temperatures throughout much of 
the Northern Hemisphere in 1989 led to the 
initiation of extensive active layer detachment 
slides within permafrost in some regions of the 
Canadian and Russian Arctic with damming and 
degradation of water quality in affected streams 
and further failures initiated. 
• 
Emissions in Arctic regions of methane from 
hydrates as a result of permafrost degradation 
may have been underestimated. 
• 
There is some evidence to suggest that glaciers 
in the Northem Hemisphere polar and subpolar 
regions are receding at a slower rate than 
p r e v i o u s l y 
suggested 
with 
some 
h a v i n g 
advanced in the past 30 years. Although the 
Southern Hemisphere record is not as detailed, 
records for several New Zealand glaciers show 
that these have retreated since the mid-1800s 
with the suggestion that this has been the result 
of 
an 
increase 
in temperature 
and 
an 
accompanying decrease in precipitation. 
Key uncertainties are associated with understanding funda-
mental cryological processes, the relationship among these 
elements (e.g.. impacts of changes in snow cover on per-
mafrost and glacier dynamics), the impacts of climate 
change on these elements of the cryosphere. the interde-
pendency of associated ecosystems (e.g., soil erosion and 
stability changes associated with permafrost degradation) 
and human systems (e.g., structures, transportation, trans-
mission lines), and the role of the cryosphere in local, 
regional and global climate and climate change. 
R E G I O N A L C L I M A T E C H A N G E PREDICTION 
The prediction of climate change at regional level precision 
is subject to great uncertainty. Precipitation changes are 
particularly uncertain, although these changes are of great 
practical significance. Progress in the development of G C M 
models is urgently needed, particulariy in terms of improv-
ing their capability for regional predictions, especially to 
understand changes in the arid and semi-arid regions. Work 
on improving regional predictions using the paleo-analogue 
method continues in Russia and other countries. In the fur-
27 

ther work of IPCC, all methods of regional climate predic­
tion should be reviewed and assessed together. 
GUIDELINES F O R ASSESSING I M P A C T S O F 
C L I M A T E C H A N G E 
Working Group II is preparmg guidelines to assess the 
socio-economic and environmental impacts of potential cli­
mate change. These guidelines will outline a framework for 
the study of climate-environment-society interactions and 
the estimation of the impacts of climate change that will 
allow comparisons and integration of impacts across vari­
ous geographical areas and economic sectors. Preliminary 
guidelmes will be available, after peer review, in 1992, 
Further work will continue as a long-term task. 
Impact assessments involve several steps: (i) definition of 
the 
problem; (li) selection of analytical method(s); (iii) 
testing the method; (iv) development of climatic and socio­
economic scenarios; (v) assessment of potential impacts; (vi) 
evaluation of technical adjustments; and (vii) considera­
tion of policy options. 
Definition of the problem includes identifying the specific 
goals of the assessment, the sector(s) and geographical 
area(s) of interest, the time horizon of the study, the data 
needs and the wider context of the work. 
Selection of analytical method(s) depends upon the avail­
ability of resources, models and data. Impact assessment 
analyses could range from the qualitative and descriptive to 
the quantitative and prognostic. Thoroughly testing the 
method(s). including model validation and sensitivity stud­
ies, prior to undertaking the full assessment is necessary to 
ensure credibility. 
Development of the climatic and socio-economic scenarios 
involves several steps. The current and projected climatic, 
socio-economic and environmental conditions expected to 
exist over the study period in the absence of climate change 
should be established. Scenarios of regional climate change 
over the study time frame must also be developed. Third, 
biophysical and environmental effects should be projected 
under the altered climate. Then these projections should be 
used, preferably in integrated environment-economic mod­
els, to calculate the socio-economic effects under the altered 
climate. Assessment of potential impacts for the sector(s) 
or area(s) of interest involves estimating the differences in 
environmental and socio-economic conditions projected to 
occur with and without climate change. 
Projections of effects with and without climate change 
should incoфorate "automatic" adjustments. However, the 
impact assessment should seek to evaluate the additional 
technical adjustments resulting from application of existing 
and new technologies or practices that may be available 
over the study period, assuming no changes in the current 
legal and institutional framework. 
The costs and benefits of climate change should be assessed, 
to the extent possible, using a common measure and dis­
counted to net present value. Alternatively, costs and 
benefits should be described qualitatively. The above gen­
eral framework would also allow consideration of policy 
options and their socio-economic and environmental 
impacts. 
MONITORING T O IDENTIFY C L I M A T E 
C H A N G E C O N S E Q U E N C E S 
There is a need to increase the available information and 
data to support impact studies, particularly in developing 
countries. This need can be met through enhancing and, 
where appropriate, establishing integrated monitoring pro­
grammes including biological, chemical, physical and 
climatological parameters, as well as constructing concur­
rent social and economic assessments, at the national, 
regional and global levels to identify climate change con­
sequences. 
Data quality needs to be assured and data 
analyses and their inteфretation need to be carried out care­
fully. 
The use of common protocols for collection and 
analysis processes (including Geographical Information 
Systems or GIS) and for equipment will aid in assuring 
intercomparability and further encourage intemational coop­
eration. 
The development of the preliminary I P C C 
guidelines for assessing the impacts of climate change is an 
important contribution to this end. 
Monitoring of sensitive terrestrial and marine ecosystems, 
including the cryosphere, and component species should 
be given priority as they could provide early detection/warn­
ing of climate change and its impacts. Also to be given 
priority are those species and ecosystems which have sig­
nificant (locally/regionally defined) social and/or economic 
values. The classic ground station approach (including 
points, plots and transects) should provide the basic build­
ing blocks of monitoring programmes, however, these 
should also be supplemented with remotely sensed obser­
vations (e.g., satellite, radar, and photogrammetry). 
Advantage should be taken of automatic data transmission 
and processing systems. 
At present, international organizations such as U N E P , 
W M O and IOC are implementing monitoring programmes 
to help identify ecological and socio-economic conse­
quences of climate change. U N E P has an initial programme 
for observing terrestrial ecosystems with observations 
extending on either side of the present boundaries of plant 
zones for eariy detection of possible shifts of these bound­
aries. W M O and I O C , among their many monitoring 
activities, have designed a satellite observation system for 
climatic and ocean parameters. 
Current planning of the 
Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) and the Global 
Ocean Observing System (GOOS) should consider the value 
of including the monitoring of terrestnal and marine eco­
logical impacts of climate change. These can provide an 
early indication of the integrated effect of climate change.

SECTION IV. 
TASK 3: 
ENERGY AND INDUSTRY RELATED ISSUES 
BY WORKING GROUP III 
INTRODUCTION 
In March 1991, the Panel identified key areas for further 
study by the Energy and Indusü^ Subgroup. Their puфoses 
were: 
(a) 
to fill significant gaps in the analysis achieved to 
date on energy and industry sector responses to 
limit climate change: and 
(b) 
to begin new areas of analysis and suggest areas 
of research which were too difficult to address in 
the first phase of the IPCC. 
These studies, which have not yet been peer-reviewed, or 
progress reports thereon are presented below in a summa­
ry manner. 
Peer review will take place later this year. 
Nevertheless, in the interim, these studies may provide use­
ful information for policy analysis and decision making. 
Although attempts have been made to reflect all available 
material, some studies were confined to a limited number 
of sources or data bases. Some studies had to rely upon 
works which were not conducted with consistent method­
ologies or data bases. 
SUMMARY OF SUBTASKS 
1) Comprehensive assessment of technologi­
cal options for mitigating global warming 
The objective of this study is to assess various technologi­
cal options for reducing greenhouse gases, particularly 
CO2, in a comprehensive way. Building upon the IPCC 
Response Strategies Report (1990) (see table 3.2), this 
paper reports some tentative findings in the survey of tech­
nologies as the first part of the work. The results of the 
second part of the work, building future scenarios on the use 
of these technologies, will be available with an updated first 
part in late 1992. 
The tentative findings are: 
(a) 
Energy conservation and improved efficiency in 
the production, conversion distribution and end 
use of energy is one of the most effective options 
available now and in the future. System restruc­
turing, such as energy cascading and infrastructure 
improvement, has promising potential. 
(b) 
The technologies to capture and sequester C 0 2 
from fossil fuel combustion deserve investigation, 
considering the expected continuing dependence 
on fossil fuels as primary energy sources. 
(c) 
Nuclear power has the technological potential to be 
one of the major energy sources in the next centu­
ry, but faces various socio-economic, security and 
safety constraints. 
(d) 
There are various existing and promising non-fos­
sil fuel technologies such as photovoltaics (PV), 
wind, hydropower, geothermal, biomass and solar 
thermal systems. 
P V may be first applied in a 
small scale on roofs, and then in larger scale on 
deserts and ocean surface if energy distribution 
technology can be advanced substantially. 
(e) 
The physical potential of biomass for energy use 
is apparently high but in some regions, competition 
in land use for food may limit its production. 
Environmentally sound intensification of agricul­
ture for more efficient production of food may be 
considered, (see also para, on biomass below). 
2) The IPCC Technology Characterization 
Inventory (TCI) 
The IPCC Technology Characterization Inventory (TCI) 
provides an information source of consistent, well-docu­
mented technology data for analysis and planning activities 
to limit greenhouse gas emissions. Special emphasis is 
given to technologies having potential interest to develop­
ing countries and economies in transition. Information from 
many sources is used to describe technologies in five cat-
gories: 
(1) Primary Energy Producfion (2) Secondary 
Energy Conservation and Processing (3) Energy Transfer 
(4) End-Use Technologies and (5) Greenhouse Gases 
Control Technologies. 
Because information and data are not sufficiently detailed 
for design of specific technology installations, addresses for 
specialists around the world are provided. The data base 
includes information for energy sources and major regions 
of the worid. Country-specific information can be included 
as it becomes available from specific applications and anal­
yses. 
Phase I consists of a preliminary design of the data base and 
descriptions of eighteen technologies. These eighteen tech­
nologies shown in Table 1 were submitted to the IPCC for 
review in February 1992. The Phase II effort began in 
December 1991. B y June 1992, the TCI will include about 
90 technologies. Future versions of the data base are expect­
ed, including both updated and added technologies.

3) Technological options for reducing 
methane emissions 
Reducing global anthropogenic methane emissions by about 
15-20 percent can halt rising atmospheric concentration of 
methane. A technological assessment of options for reduc-
ing methane emissions from anthropogenic sources (about 
60 percent of global methane emissions) has been developed 
through the United States/Japan W o r k i n g Group on 
Methane, which compiled information submitted by IPCC 
participating countries. Technological options are available 
for limiting emissions from the major sources, other than 
flooded rice cultivation and biomass buming. These options 
may be economically viable at suitable locations in many 
regions of the world, and represent different levels of tech-
nical and capital needs (summarized in Table 2). In many 
cases, these options provide a range of benefits, including 
better air quality, better protection of surface and ground-
water, enhanced productivity, reduced risk of explosion, 
and improved availability and use of energy resources. 
Some of these technologies are already established and 
proven beneficial in certain markets. Barriers which hinder 
the further implementation of these options in many coun-
tries, especially developing countries include availability of 
capital, lack of technical information, and conflicting incen-
tive systems. 
These barriers need to be addressed on a 
country and site-specific basis.

4) Increasing electricity end-use efficiency 
The study addresses the topic of increasing electricity end-
use efficiency by providing an in-depth review of the 
following: (a) the status of available technologies for 
increasing electric end-use efficiency; (b) factors that limit 
the application and widespread deployment of these tech-
nologies; and (c) policies that have been implemented to 
increase the efficiency of electricity end-use. 
The conclusions of the report are summarized as follows. A 
substantial fraction of increased anthropogenic carbon emis-
sion over the next several decades is likely to come from 
electricity generation. 
Increases in end-use efficiency 
improvements beyond those expected to occur under current 
technologies and policies could cut significantly the growth 
of electricity use and associated growth in projected carbon 
emissions. Based on experience among industrialized and 
developing countries conceming the technologies and pro-
grammes and policies, significant increases in electricity 
end-use efficiency are possible. It appears that many of 
these increases can be achieved in a cost-effective manner. 
Enhancing adoption of these efficient technologies by devel-
oping countries IS an essential part of a successful strategy 
to curtail growth in emissions of greenhouse gases. 
5) Natural gas prospects and policies 
One option for reducing C 0 2 emissions is the substitution 
of natural gas for more carbon-intensive fuels. The demand 
for gas is growing woridwide and is expected to nearly 
double by the year 2005. As the starting point for its anal-
ysis, the I P C C has reviewed the International Energy 
Agency's ( l E A ) natural gas study. Natural Gas Prospects  
and Policies (October 1991). This study provides a com-
prehensive analysis of demand and supply for natural gas 
including the institutional framework surrounding the pro-
duction, transmission and use of natural gas. The study's 
primary focus is on demand for natural gas in O E C D coun-
tries, but sources from outside the O E C D are extensively 
treated. The l E A forecasts that demand for natural gas out-
side O E C D will be approximately twice that of O E C D by 
2005. The study indicates that ample gas resources exist 
worldwide even with the expected doubling of demand in 
some of the regions through the year 2005 at prices ranging 
from $3 to $6 per MBtu (in 1990 USS). However, the study 
did not address the ability to meet demand after 2005. 
Intergovernmental agreements to facilitate and maintain 
competitive markets, access to resources and transmission 
systems, and commercial contracts on a non-discriminato-
ry intemational basis are likely to be required before private 
capital can be mobilized to back very large, long term gas 
development in remote parts of the world. 
Further IPCC analysis should be devoted particularly to 
non-OECD countries, greatly increased global and region-
al demand, and supply and demand issues beyond 2005. 
6) Thematic assessment of the road 
transport sector 
Because of the importance of the road transport sector, to 
present and future emissions of greenhouse gases, the Panel 
decided to carry out a thematic analysis of the sector. The 
work will concentrate on such measures as fuel efficiency, 
altemative transport fuels, emission reduction devices and 
structural, institutional, and organizational changes. 
The 
work is just beginning so no conclusions are available at this 
time. 
7) Biomass, bioenergy and limitation of 
greenhouse gas emissions 
A review of the use of biomass as a source of energy con-
cludes that bioenergy offers important opportunities to 
reduce greenhouse gases through displacement of fossil 
fuels. It is noted that C O , emissions from renewed or waste 
biomass do not add to the overall atmosphenc burden of car-
bon on a life cycle basis. 
Some biomass combustion 
technologies are available that, additionally, reduce other 
greenhouse gases (e.g., C H ^ and N , 0 ) . 
Greenhouse gas emissions can be reduced both by seques-
tration of carbon and production of bioenergy. 
The 
following measures should be considered: use of waste 
biomass as a fuel and production of biomass by intensive but 
environmentally sound forestry and agriculture practices, 
consistent with conservation of carbon in forests and soils. 
Combustion of biomass can already be competitive with fos-
sil fuels for (1) production of heat or steam and (2) 
cogeneration of steam and electricity. Environmentally 
sound production of liquid biofuels should also be considered. 
The first part of the report is available for review. The sec-
ond part of the report dealing with technologies will be 
available late in 1992 for review. 
8) World economic impacts of response 
measures by industrialized countries 
Carbon dioxide and carbon taxes in the energy sector have 
been the focus of several available studies. The economic 
impacts of such measures to control greenhouse gas emis-
sions would vary among industnalized countries, because of 
the difference existing among them in their resource endow-
ments, the relative structure of energy prices, the ability 
for fuel substitution and the achieved levels of energy effi-
ciency. The studies reviewed to date in this effort indicate 
that the costs of applying carbon tax measures could reduce 
G D P growth in industrialized countries. The costs could be 
reduced if flexible, phased, comprehensive and concerted 
response strategies were adopted to control greenhouse 
gases. Further systematic and comprehensive analysis of 
available studies is needed on this important and complex 
subject. 
31 

The impacts of these measures will not be limited to indus­
trialized economies, but will also affect the economies of 
developing countries. One general economic study by the 
World Bank indicates that a change in O E C D growth could 
affect the growth rate of developing countries rather sig­
nificantly without off-setting programmes. Factors of this 
economic interdependency include energy prices, balance of 
trade, developing country revenue, extemal debt, invest­
ment and aid flows. 
9) Analysis of factors affecting energy 
consumption and CO2 emissions and their 
regional and sectoral differences 
This assessment deals with factors affecting regional and 
sectoral differences in energy consumption and related C O , 
emissions. The supporting material contains: (a) analysis of 
factors affecting total and sectoral C O , emissions; (b) 
regional comparison of changing rates of factors; (c) long 
run changes in carbon intensity and technology improve­
ments; and (d) non-commercial energy consumption in 
developing countries. The assessment indicates that such 
factors as economic development, population growth, ener­
gy conservation, changes in industrial structure, fuel 
switching, and technological advance influence the region­
al and sectoral pattems of historical energy consumption and 
C O , emissions. Other factors such as climatic conditions 
could be also considered. These factors function different­
ly in different countries and regions. 
Analysis of energy consumption and C O , emissions would 
be important to select and plan a suitable set of options for 
mitigating global warming. The analytical methods 
reviewed in the assessment underway can be useful tools. 
Some methods discussed can provide a common analytical 
framework for countries, even with present limitations on 
data availability. The analysis will also deepen common 
understanding of historical and current situations of indi­
vidual countries. 
Future subjects of this interim assessment include: (a) sep­
aration of industrial structure changes and energy efficiency 
improvements in the energy conservation factors; and (b) 
sectoral analysis of factors affecting energy consumption 
and C O , emissions in developing countries. The analyses 
discussed in this study could serve as starting points. 
Further detailed research would be useful on more factors 
affecting energy consumption, economic cycles and C O , 
emissions in each sector, on the basis of results obtained in 
the work now underway. 
10) Country studies 
A survey of country studies has been developed in cooper­
ation with U N E P and through a review of other sources. 
The term "country studies" is defined to include any official 
national study on greenhouse gas emission inventories, 
impact assessments, and emission mitigation analyses. It 
includes energy and industry, agriculture, forests and other 
sectors. Numerous other studies have been undertaken by 
institutions in various countries which are not reflected in 
this survey, since they have not been endorsed as official 
national studies. 
A s of February 1992, more than fifty 
countries have or plan to initiate some form of country 
study through internal, bilateral or multilateral support *. In 
addition, several countries have indicated a wish to partic­
ipate in country studies, but lack the financial and/or 
technical resources to carry out such studies. 
As yet, a comprehensive methodology for country studies 
has not been developed, although work is underway in sev­
eral IPCC working groups and elsewhere to partially address 
this need. Current efforts include a project supported by 
U N E P to establish a consistent methodological framework 
for undertaking cost assessments of greenhouse gas abate­
ment options. The project is being implemented by Riso 
National Laboratory in Denmark. In addition, draft guide­
lines have been prepared by Finland and the U S . A l l these 
activities may assist countries in preparing future studies, but 
there is an urgent need to give a higher priority to these 
activities. 
FUTURE WORK 
Draft final reports from subtasks (2), (3), and (4) and draft 
preliminary reports from subtasks (1), (7), (8), (9), and (10) 
were distributed to I P C C participants in February 1992. 
After the review comments are incoфorated, these reports 
will be produced as final or intenm reports in June 1992. 
Subtask (5) was met by use of a complete l E A report. 
Subtask (6) is just beginning under Austrian leadership with 
a contribution from l E A . 
As can be seen from the foregoing summaries, several ongo­
ing projects require continuing work. Several of the studies 
need to be expanded to include other regions. 
A n element of Task 3 which has not yet been undertaken is 
the "identification of the full economic, environmental and 
other types of costs and benefits." It may be useful to ini­
tiate a review and assessment of alternative methodologies 
or concepts which could be of value in such analyses.

SECTION V. 
TASK 4: AGRICULTURE AND FORESTRY RELATED ISSUES 
BY WORKING GROUP III. 
INTRODUCTION 
During the session of W G III on I November 1991 and in 
accordance with decisions of the Fifth Session of IPCC 
(Geneva. March, 1991), the Subgroup (AFOS) was 
charged to contribute to the ongoing update of the IPCC 
Response Strategies Report (1990) by: 
(a) 
an assessment of the greenhouse gas (GHG) emis-
sions, taking into consideration sources and sinks 
in agriculture, forestry and other related human 
activities, and 
(b) 
an assessment of technologies and management 
systems in these areas for mitigation and adapta-
tion to climate change. 
AGRICULTURE 
Present and future agricultural GHG 
emissions 
Recent improvements in scientific understanding support 
the previous findings of the 1990 report, in particular the fol-
lowing. 
As far as the net carbon dioxide release from agricultural 
activities is concerned, forest clearing in the tropical and 
subtropical areas of the worid continue to be the major 
source. Additionally, the cultivation of virgin land, whether 
in tropical or temperate agricultural areas, results in grad-
ual carbon losses. 
Its relative contribution, however, to 
C O , concentrations is still to be determined. At the other 
extreme, long-standing arable soils do not constitute a major 
net source of C O , , because their carbon contents reach 
equilibria which do not change very much unless cropping 
and management practices are altered. 
Projections of the future G H G emissions related to land use 
depend on the initial use. the rate of land conversion, and 
productivity including cultivation density. If production did 
not increase, expected population growth and rising food 
demand would require the area of tropical agriculture to 
expand by over 60% by the year 2025. It is unlikely this 
additional land would be available. If all the additional land 
were to come from forest or grassland, it would cause a 
gradual breakdown of soil organic matter, releasing C O , . 
There may be another effect in that global warming will 
speed up the decomposition of soil organic matter, thereby 
releasing additional C O , to the atmosphere. Model calcu-
lations, assuming no increase in organic residue returns, 
predict this soil carbon loss to be up to 60 Gtons within 
about 60 years. This corresponds to a current global C O , 
release from fossil fuel of about 10 years. On the other 
hand, there are indications that this could be offset by an 
enhanced plant residue formation both above and below 
ground, due to the C O , fertilization effect. 
As for the release of methane, total global and individual 
source emission estimates remain essentially as presented 
in the IPCC First Assessment Report ( 1990), but with some 
individual source changes. There has been a réévaluation 
of some sources, particularly rice, and the additional sources 
such as animal and domestic wastes. A large portion of 
these emissions comes from liquid waste handling systems. 
Uncertainties in global and regional emissions remain sig-
nificant. A detailed analysis of new information on rice 
suggests annual emissions in the lower end of the 20-150 
Tg/year range. 
In the absence of mitigation measures, methane emissions 
are likely to continue to increase from each source as 
increases in animal products and rice are required in order 
to feed the world population. Current emissions for ani-
mals, rice, and animal wastes could grow by about 40-60%, 
50-60% and 30-40% respectively by 2025. 
Unfortunately, the data conceming the release of nitrous 
oxide from agriculture still cannot be reliably derived. 
Keeping in mind that the annual increase of N , 0 in the 
atmosphere is 3 - 4.5 Tg of nitrogen as N , 0 , and knowing 
that the release from combustion processes has thus far been 
overestimated, most of this net increase may be due to anthro-
pogenic nitrogen inputs. About 80 Tg of industrially-fixed 
nitrogen is presently applied to world agriculture. Taking 
the upper value of estimates for the conversion of fertiliz-
er nitrogen into N , 0 , which is 3.2 %, the fertilizer-induced 
release for 1990 could be calculated as 2.5 Tg of nitrogen 
as N , 0 . Since another 90 Tg of nitrogen or so are fixed by 
managed leguminous plants, this combination could account 
for most of the increase of N , 0 in the atmosphere. 
Large nitrogen suфluses are frequent, especially in inten­
sive agricultural systems. This excess nitrogen is prone to 
both nitrate leaching and denitrification, although the ratio 
of N , to N , 0 formation varies considerably from case to 
case. However, it should also be borne in mind that not only 
the unused but virtually the whole nitrogen introduced by 
mankind into the worid ecosystem will sooner or later 
become denitrified, thus adding to the overall N , 0 increase 
in the atmosphere. 
The significant unknown is the time 
scale over which this will occur. 
Background assumptions about future food and land 
demand being the same as above, nitrogen fertilizer con­
sumption may increase by the year 2025 from 80 to more 
33 

than 120 Tg of nitrogen per year. Without changes in tech-
nology, the fertilizer-derived release of nitrous oxide is 
likely to increase by some 50%. 
Agricultural potentials for mitigation and 
adaptation 
In order to reduce the net carbon dioxide release from agri-
culture, improving the productivity of existing arable land 
should be given priority over the cultivation of virgin soils. 
Furthermore, in the less populated areas of the worid, 
marginal farmland could be set aside for either rangeland or 
forest use. 
Reduced soil tillage, improved utilization of organic wastes 
as amendments of carbon into the soil and crop rotations 
including forages are agricultural practices which reduce 
carbon losses and/or sequester additional carbon in soils. 
Although these practices may sequester several gigatonnes 
(Gt) of carbon over a few decades, this represents only a 
fraction of the release of carbon from fossil fuels over the 
same period. This is because soils have a finite capacity for 
accumulating organic matter. Nevertheless, these manage-
ment practices are essential if soil fertility is to be 
maintained or enhanced. 
As for the control of methane, while investigations are con-
tinuing on emission reducing options, the principal 
approaches remain as reported in 1990 report. Opportunities 
exist to reduce methane from enteric fermentation and ani-
mal waste storage, for example, by modifying feeding 
practices, using productivity enhancing practices and agents, 
and modifying waste, management practices. Emissions 
reductions of 25 to 75% per unit product in some animal 
management systems appear feasible. Due to the diversity 
of animal management systems, including economic and 
socio-cultural factors, the importance of categorizing man-
agement systems and matching emission-reducing options 
to the systems is now being emphasized. Additionally, the 
implications of reduction options for the emissions from ani-
mal waste of other greenhouse gases, including nitrous 
oxide, are now being addressed. 
Methane emissions from rice cultivation may potentially be 
reduced while maintaining or enhancing productivity. 
Mitigative practices may include modifying water depth 
and timing of irrigation, the type, rate, and application 
method of fertilizer, alternative cultivation technologies, 
and cultivar selection. Much research is still required in 
order to realize these opportunities, and therefore a short-
term reduction of methane emissions from rice growing 
cannot be expected. However, over a number of decades, 
while doubling rice production, an integrated management 
approach may succeed in reducing methane releases by 20 
- 40%. 
Better balanced nitrogen budgets, especially in intensive 
agriculture, are a key measure for reducing overall nitrous 
oxide emissions. This should also include a better account-
ing for the nitrogen from livestock wastes within fertilizer 
application regimes. Other options include nitrification 
inhibitors or improved fertilizer formulations and applica-
tion. 
However, the most promising way to reduce N , 0 
losses is an integrated nitrogen-management system which 
maximises nitrogen recycling while minimising fertilizer 
inputs. This is all the more important since N , 0 , due to its 
long lifetime, will accumulate in the atmosphere, constitut-
ing an increasing threat to the ozone layer. 
In addition to these mitigation strategies, future efforts of 
A F O S should assess the ability of agricultural systems to 
adapt to climate change. 
FORESTRY 
Forests provide mankind with a wide range of economic, 
social and environmental benefits, but they are increasing-
ly being threatened by unsustainable forest management 
practices, air pollution, and climate change. 
Concerted 
action needs to be taken at national and intemational levels 
to protect the worid's forests. Action will be successful only 
if it takes into account the interdependence of the econom-
ic, social and cultural factors that bear on the management 
of forests. 
Status of forests 
It is difficult to determine the present extent of tropical for-
est cover. Recent estimates on a country basis indicate that 
there are approximately 1.9 billion hectares of tropical 
forests. 
One concem has been given particular attention since the 
1990 report is the rate of deforestation globally and in indi-
vidual countries. 
The F A O estimated rates of global 
deforestation for the I980's in closed forests (about 14 mil-
lion hectares/year) and in closed and open forests (about 17 
million hectares/year) are much higher than for the late 
1970's), by 90% and 50%, respectively. Calculations by 
other authoritative sources show significantly lower fig-
ures in the order of about 10 million hectares. 
Approximately 770 million hectares of forests belong to 
the temperate zones with an estimated carbon storage of 25 
Gt in biomass excluding soils. Forest area in boreal zones 
amounts to about 920 million hectares, storing 150-190 Gt 
of carbon in biomass including soils. In addition a consid-
erable amount of carbon is stored in forest soils and 
peatlands, especially in boreal zones. 
Forestry options 
The following four options were identified: 
Slowing currently ongoing deforestation and forest degra- 
dation 
For an accurate assessment of cost effectiveness, it would 
be necessary to quantify the reduction of the amount of car-
bon released to the atmosphere. 
So far, only preliminary 
34 

estimates сап be given. Nevertheless, it seems evident that 
first priority should be given to this option, thus maintain­
ing already existing biomass in natural as well as in 
managed forests. 
In tropical regions, it is necessary to 
involve local people in sustainable silvicultural practices. In 
temperate and boreal zones, this refers especially to the 
new type of forest decline attributed to man-made air pol­
lution, logging, and to the potential effects of climate change 
Itself Slowing deforestation and forest degradation bears 
a significant potential to keep carbon stored in biomass. 
retards desertification and is the requirement for further 
action. 
Increasing forest biomass 
There is generally a significant potential for increasing 
biomass in forests, especially in young, understocked, over-
logged and/or misused forests. 
However, the costs and 
time-frame are uncertain. 
Improved use of wood 
The use of wood for long-lived products provides benefits 
in terms of carbon storage as well as sustainable forest man­
agement. 
Industrialised countries have possibilities for 
improved use of wood, such as the recycling of paper and 
paperboard, and the replacement of more fossil energy 
intensive raw-materials by wood. The use of wood as a 
source of energy offers important opportunities for reduc­
ing G H G emissions by substituting fossil fuels (as described 
in the EIS report). 
Afforestation 
The potential for afforestation in boreal, temperate and trop­
ical biomes is uncertain. However, the current estimates for 
afforestation are 50-150 million hectares in boreal, 50-125 
million hectares in temperate and 400-750 million hectares 
in tropical zones (200-300 million hectares in dry tropical 
areas). For tropical zones, the land potentially available will 
be less than the amount physically capable of afforestation 
because the ultimate decisions on land use are based on 
many other factors. For the boreal zones, the potential to 
increase the forest area is limited because not all non-forest­
ed land is environmentally capable of supporting forest 
ecosystems. 
At present, plantations account for most of the afforestation 
in temperate zones. Preliminary assessments of gross costs 
of afforestation have recently become available and range 
from US$ 30 - US$ 60 per ton of carbon in boreal and tem­
perate zones and US$ 10 - US$ 30 per ton of carbon in the 
tropical zone. However, it is uncertain how much carbon 
could be sequestered at such costs. 
Noordwijk request 
The Noordwijk Conference on "Atmospheric Pollution and 
Climate Change' in November 1989 established the target 
of a net global increase in forest area of 12 million hectare 
a year by the beginning of the next century. The Bangkok 
Workshop (1991) concluded that the prospect of attaining 
the target was very limited, and that the net rate of forest loss 
would be slowed or reversed over a longer period of time. 
However, the option of afforestation would still be impor­
tant and better data need to be developed to assess the 
potential. 
OTHER HUMAN ACTIVITIES 
Present and future emissions 
Efforts to better understand the emissions of methane from 
domestic wastes managed in landfills have produced results 
which are consistent with the previously estimated 20-70 
Tg/year from this source and better describe the regional dif­
ferences in waste generated per capita and quantities of 
waste landfilled. Currently, about 60% of these emissions 
are from the O E C D countries. No additional information is 
available to describe the 20-25 Tg/year of estimated 
methane emissions from wastewater lagoons primarily in 
developing countries. 
Forecasting efforts continue to estimate 50-90 Tg/year from 
landfills globally by 2025. Developing countries will rep­
resent an increasing share of these emissions, over 50% by 
2025. This IS due to the expected increases in urban popu­
lations over the next 30 years and the increasing prevalence 
m these countries of landfilling, which generates more 
methane than waste piles. No additional work appears to 
have been performed for wastewater lagoons. 
Potentials for mitigation 
Recent work better characterizes the technological options 
for reducing methane emissions identified in the 1990 
report. This work continues to show a range of options are 
available that can reduce methane emissions at modern 
landfill sites by 60 to 90% and up to 80% from wastewater 
lagoons. These options require varying degrees of initial 
capital and are of varying levels of technical complexity. 
They generally provide other benefits such as increased 
safety, better air quality, better waste management and fuel 
recovery, and therefore can have positive economic returns. 
Continued efforts need to address barriers which limit the 
further implementation of these options such as availabili­
ty of capital and technical information. 
Competing land use 
Currently, most developed countries have virtually static 
populations and have achieved high productivity growth 
rates. In developing countries, the situation is the reverse, 
with low productivity, high population growth, unfavourable 
climatic conditions, lack of appropriate technology and 
inadequate infrastructure. Consequently, food security in 
these countries remains uncertain and economic growth 
may continue to be slow or even stagnant. It is clear that the 
historic growth pattern for land use cannot be sustained 
35 

over the next century. 
For example, between 1882 and 
1991, arable land use expanded by 74%. Similar rates of 
expansion in the future would exceed the area of land poten-
tially suitable for ecologically sound and sustainable 
agriculture, it is also clear that the pressure for additional 
land use for agriculture is largely an issue for the develop­
ing countries, with competing demands for agriculture and 
forestry. 
CONCLUDING REMARKS 
This updated report supports and confirms that some indi­
vidual options in the different sectors of agriculture and 
forestry to mitigate G H G emissions or even to sequester 
existing C O , are relatively small on a global basis, but 
together they may contribute significantly to national or 
global abatement strategies. 
SECTION VI. 
TASK 5: 
VULNERABILITY TO SEA LEVEL RISE 
BY WORKING GROUP III 
INTRODUCTION 
In 1991, the Coastal Zone Management Subgroup ( C Z M S ) 
of Working Group III, began to implement the recommen­
dations in its report entitled: 
S T R A T E G I E S F O R 
A D A P T A T I O N T O S E A L E V E L RISE ( C Z M S R E P O R T , 
1990). Among the recommendations was the need to pro­
vide to coastal countries, including small island nations, in 
the context of their socio-economic development, technical 
assistance to: 
(i) 
identify coastal areas at risk; 
(ii) 
assess their vulnerability to potential impacts of an 
accelerated sea level rise ( A S L R ) as described in 
the IPCC First Assessment Report 1990); and, 
(iii) 
idevelop and, where possible, implement compre­
hensive coastal zone management plans to reduce 
vulnerability to A S L R before the year 2000. espe­
cially for countries with vulnerable coastal areas. 
The benefits of these steps should be seen in the context of 
accelerating socio-economic development worldwide in 
coastal areas and the related increasing environmental stress 
on coastal resources. In this regard, integrated coastal plan­
ning would facilitate sustainable development of coastal 
areas and conservation of natural ecosystems. 
Capacity building and institutional strengthening to devel­
op and implement coastal zone management is identified as 
a priority for low-lying coastal areas. Related to this, the 
present intemational framework for cooperation should be 
strengthened. 
In order to better assess and respond to the needs of coastal 
countries, the C Z M S has: 
(1) 
developed a common methodology to be used in 
country studies to assess vulnerability and consider 
possible response strategies; 
(2) 
assisted in coordinating a number of case studies 
which incoфorate the assessment steps identified in 
the common methodology; and have initiated work on 
global vulnerability assessment in close cooperation 
with IPCC Working Groups I and II; 
(3) 
identified the need for strengthening the capabilities of 
vulnerable developing countries in implementing adap­
tive C Z M programmes, aiming at sustainable and 
ecologically sound development, and identified the 
need for structural facilities for bilateral and multilat­
eral financing of: 
sharing information, data and methodologies; and 
assisting in implementation of C Z M programmes; 
and 
strengthening institutional capabilities. 
While all of the assessment work has not been completed, 
what has been learned to date is in line with the conclusions 
and findings of the C Z M S as presented in the IPCC First 
Assessment Report (FAR). 
IPCC TASK 5 OBJECTIVES 
Following the conclusions of the F A R , the C Z M S was 
tasked at the March 1991 IPCC Plenary to address the fol­
lowing: 
commence an assessment of the vulnerability of 
developing and developed countries to A S L R ; 
• 
develop a common methodology for assessing 
vulnerability through country case studies; 
undertake developing country case studies on a 
bilateral basis and in cooperation with the U N E P 
Regional Seas Programme; 
support the development of C Z M plans that 
incorporate 
response 
measures 
to 
reduce 
vulnerability to A S L R and address pressing coastal 
management concems, where appropriate, by the 
year 2000; 
36 

develop links with the coastal zone impacts studies 
being undertaken by WGII while undertaking the 
country case study assessments; 
convene workshops to assess the results of the case 
studies undertaken; 
identify the appropriate response strategies and 
mechanisms for implementing them; 
estimate the level and kind of assistance needed 
from intemational organizations and donor nations 
for further assessments and implementation of 
coastal management plans; and, 
consider recommendations for proposed future 
work. 
Completion of the task is a long-term objective. In the 
short-term, the task requires the development of a method­
ology to assess vulnerability to A S L R , the application of the 
methodology to assessment work underway, and the con­
sideration of the needs of coastal developing countries for 
assistance. 
ASSESSMENT WORK COMPLETED 
IPCC First Assessment Report. The C Z M S contributed 
to the IPCC F A R by producing a C Z M S Report on the 
S T R A T E G I E S F O R A D A P T A T I O N T O S E A L E V E L 
RISE. 
As a result of the significant participation from 
developing countries at two major intemational workshops 
held in Miami (November 1989) and Perth (February 1990), 
the C Z M S report identified the response strategies for 
coastal areas: to retreat, to accommodate, or to protect 
from the potential adverse impacts associated with A S L R 
(including the conservation and protection of natural coastal 
defense, e.g., tidal flats, mangroves, sea grass beds and 
coral reefs). Each response strategy has implications for 
trade-offs and can be implemented within a framework of 
integrated coastal zone management planning. 
The C Z M S Report. The C Z M S made 10 recommenda­
tions divided among three major categories: 
National 
Coastal Planning; Intemational Cooperation; and Research, 
Data and Information. A suggested ten-year timeline for the 
implementation of comprehensive C Z M planning was 
included, along with an estimated cost for providing five 
years of technical assistance to support this effort. Lastly, 
the Report provided a "Worid-wide Cost Estimate of Basic 
Coastal Protection Measures." 
Common Methodology. The C Z M S developed "The 
Seven Steps to the Assessment of the Vulnerability of 
Coastal 
Areas to Sea 
Level 
Rise - A C o m m o n 
Methodology" in eariy 1991. After a detailed process of 
review, comments and revisions made by IPCC partici­
pants, the C Z M S feels that the Common Methodology 
provides a useful methodological framework for coastal 
countries to assess their vulnerability to A S L R and consid­
er response strategies. The use of this common methodol­
ogy could for many countries, be a first step in the 
establishment of a systematic approach in the management 
of coastal areas. Such C Z M planning would facilitate the 
decision making process for socio-economic development 
and the mitigation of vulnerability of coastal areas and 
resources. As more countries conduct vulnerability analy­
sis assessments, the Common Methodology would provide 
a framework for global assessments based on a global 
database. In addition, this information could facilitate pri­
ority setting by institutional bodies. 
The C o m m o n 
Methodology has been translated into French, Spanish and 
Arabic. 
Case studies. In many instances, the C Z M S has been suc­
cessful in serving as a coordination body bringing together 
countries to conduct case studies assessing vulnerability. 
For example, Australia, France, Japan, The Netherlands, 
the United Kingdom and the United States are sponsoring, 
on a bilateral basis, more than two dozen case studies in 
developing countries, as well as conducting studies within 
their own borders. The U N E P is also conducting a number 
of case studies. Coordination between the two efforts has 
provided mutual benefits. The results of the case studies will 
be presented at a C Z M S workshop hosted by Venezuela in 
March 1992, after which a report will be produced. A full 
list of countries participating in the vulnerability pro­
grammes and list of countries still desiring assistance is 
presented in the supporting IPCC C Z M S report. 
The interest expressed by developing countries for con­
ducting vulnerability analysis and identifying 
response 
strategies has been tremendous, with a number of countries 
asking for country study assistance. A number of develop­
ing countries have also conducted their own country studies, 
which indicates the seriousness of the matter to them. 
However, because much of the work is being done on an ad 
hoc basis, the C Z M S is not able to satisfy the demand. To 
better respond to the many requests that arise from vulner­
able developing coastal countries, both the institutional and 
the financial aspects need further attention. 
Status of country activities. The C Z M S prepared a one-
page questionnaire regarding the current status of country 
activities concerning A S L R and C Z M planning. This ques­
tionnaire was answered by 37 countries. The preliminary 
results indicate that nearly 90 percent of those who respond­
ed expect that all or portions of their coastlines will be 
vulnerable to sea level rise, that only 30 percent have con­
ducted an impact study of sea level nse on their coastal zone 
resources with even fewer (20 percent) studying response 
options, and that only 20 percent have some form of coastal 
zone management which includes policies that incoфorate 
sea level rise. On the positive side is the fact that more than 
50 percent of those responding have some form of coastal 
management policy "in-place". On the potential demand 
side, more than 80 percent expressed a willingness to coop­
erate with assisting countries in conducting vulnerability 
assessment studies.

COMMON METHODOLOGY 
The Common Methodology is a guideline for assessing vul­
nerability to A S L R . In assessing vulnerability, three levels 
of boundary conditions and scenarios are incoфorated in the 
methodology: (1) the impacts on socio-economic develop­
ments; (2) the impacts on the natural coastal systems; and 
(3) the implications of possible response strategies for adap­
tation. 
The Common Methodology now includes consideration of 
the present situation and a rise of 0.3 meters and 1.0 meters 
by the year 2100. These scenarios represent the low and the 
high estimates of the 1990 IPCC F A R . Appropriate modi­
fications are made for subsidence, uplift and storm surges 
and any other circumstances peculiar to a study area. At the 
present stage, the focus of the Common Methodology is on 
the effects of A S L R (and existing storm pattems). In the 
future, more attention will have to be given to the vulnera­
bility of coastal areas with regard to other aspects of climate 
change, such as changing storm intensities, storm pattems, 
and soil moisture. 
The objectives of the present Common Methodology are: 
(a) 
to provide a basis for coastal countries to assess the 
vulnerability of their coastal areas to A S L R ; 
(b) 
to provide a basis for a world-wide comparative 
assessment of vulnerability of coastal areas; 
(c) 
to provide a mechanism for identifying priority 
needs of developing coastal countries; and 
(d) 
to provide a basis for decisions on responsive mea­
sure. 
The process, therefore, helps each country to identify the 
actions needed to plan for and cope with the impacts asso­
ciated with potential A S L R . 
The.se steps will help each 
country: to define its vulnerability; to examine the feasi­
bility of response options, including their institutional, eco­
nomical, technical and social implications; and to identify 
needs for assistance in order to apply the response options. 
CASE STUDIES AND WORKSHOPS 
The evaluation of vulnerability to A S L R is being under­
taken in a number of countries. As of 1 January 1992. 
studies were either completed, in progress or in planning in 
27 countries by members of the C Z M S with an additional 
14 cases being sponsored through the U N E P Regional Seas 
Programme. These case studies represent different types of 
coasts and a wide range of techniques and methodologies. 
Some studies are a portion of a larger country study on cli­
mate change impacts, while others are focused on A S L R . 
Some have evaluated response options, including the need 
for C Z M S planning to reduce vulnerability to A S L R . 
As each coastal country undertakes vulnerability assess­
ment studies, that information will assist in providing a 
better global picture of the potential problems of A S L R on 
coastal resources and level of effort that may be required in 
response. The C Z M S is now working on a world-wide esti­
mate of socio-economic and ecological implications of sea 
level rise (e.g., the number of people at risk and an estimate 
of ecological impacts). This analysis will be based on 
information made available through case studies, ques­
tionnaires, and additional fact finding. 
The Common Methodology is being used and tested in 
more than a dozen case studies. From these efforts, advan­
tages and disadvantages are being revealed which are 
proving very valuable to the development of the method­
ology. The Common Methodology will be updated based 
on the case studies discussed at the Venezuela workshop in 
March 1992 and as appropriate in the future. 
The consensus is that the Common Methodology provides 
a broad basis for coastal countries to assess their vulnera­
bility to A S L R and to identify, evaluate and select response 
The Common Methodology utilizes a seven-step approach as shown in Table A :

options to reduce their vulnerability to A S L R . This broad 
basis allows for flexibility such that local and national con-
ditions can be fully taken into account. The studies indicate 
that coastal planning can reduce vulnerability to A S L R . 
Vulnerability to A S L R is the cumulative effect of natural 
processes, coastal development and climate change. C Z M 
can reduce the effects of development on natural processes 
and the effects of natural processes on development. As a 
result, coastal planning can reduce vulnerability to A S L R 
while promoting sustainable development. 
International workshops. International workshops have 
played a significant role in the gathering of information 
from a wide variety of sources. Two intemational work-
shops will be convened to discuss the results of the case 
studies. At the Venezuela workshop, representatives of 25 
countries will present reports on their case studies. Much 
will be leamed, including information on the potential costs 
and benefits of various response options or strategies, and 
on each country's capability to respond to A S L R within the 
framework of comprehensive C Z M planning. Another 
workshop will be held in New Caledonia in April 1992 that 
will focus on climate change, sea level rise and coastal zone 
management in the South Pacific. 
INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION 
The C Z M S was asked to estimate the level and kind of 
assistance needed from international organizations and 
donor nations for further assessments and implementation 
of national management plans. So far, there is only a rough 
estimate of resources required to meet the target: "by the 
year 2000 all relevant coastal countries should have com-
prehensive coastal management programs to reduce their 
vulnerability to A S L R and other impacts of climate change". 
Considerable resources would be required and many coun-
tries would need financial support. 
To support an efficient and effective development of such 
plans, intemational cooperation is important, especially to 
ensure: 
• 
the continuation of vulnerability assessments; 
the development of guidelines for C Z M planning 
programs; and 
an efficient coordination through bilateral and 
multilateral cooperation. 
CONCLUSIONS AND 
RECOMMENDATIONS 
Conclusions. Since its creation in 1989, the C Z M S has: 
held international workshops that were widely 
attended by developing and developed nations and 
initiated global assessments of vulnerability to 
A S L R ; 
• 
developed a common methodology for conducting 
assessments of the vulnerability of coastal areas to 
A S L R ; and 
served as a coordinator of 30 case studies conducted 
on a bilateral basis between C Z M S 
member 
countries. 
Throughout this period, it has become increasingly clear of 
the need for coastal countries: 
to assess the multiple components of their 
vulnerabilities to future sea level rise and related 
extreme events in relation to development and the 
protection of coastal ecosystems; 
to understand its implications to their natural, 
social, legal and economic systems; and 
to begin to plan appropriate response strategies in 
areas of awareness and institution building. 
Part of this response would be to develop integrated coastal 
management planning capable of addressing, in a compre-
hensive way, the impacts of A S L R , along with the other 
pressing problems impacting coastal resources. This inte-
grated planning in coastal areas must focus on sustainable 
development. Strengthening the institutional and legal capa-
bility of vulnerable developing countries is a base line 
condition and can be stimulated by information exchange 
and technology cooperation within the framework of a net-
work as established by the IPCC C Z M S in association with 
U N E P . 
The C Z M S has identified a growing awareness in coastal 
countries of the potential impacts on the coastal resources 
due to A S L R and other impacts of climate change. This 
awareness has manifested itself in their interest in integrat-
ed management planning. This interest must be encouraged 
and assisted. Most coastal developing countries have not 
developed C Z M planning capabilities, or made assessments 
of their vulnerability to A S L R . Even though, in many cases, 
long lead times are required to begin the process of adapta-
tion to sea level rise, very few have begun any planning or 
taken any measures as might be necessary. 
The C Z M S still has much to accomplish. Preliminary find-
ings indicate there is a need to: 
Complete current and requested country case 
studies and conduct additional studies in the 
framework of C Z M S , in cooperation with the 
U N E P , W M O , I O C and other 
international 
organizations. 
Promote further research on the effects of climate 
change on coastal areas, in particular with regard to 
extreme events. 
39 

Include, as regional climate models improve, their 
results (e.g., the potential changing intensity and 
patterns of cyclones, hurricanes and typhoons), in 
the assessment of vulnerability of coastal areas to 
A S L R and other impacts of global climate change. 
Recommendations. The following recommendations are 
made based on the progress to date: 
• 
Coastal countries, that have not already done so, 
should: 
(1) 
as.sess their vulnerability to A S L R and other 
potential impacts of global climate change and 
assess the assets at risk: 
(2) 
start the planning process for appropriate 
response strategies; and 
(3) 
adevelop, by the year 2000, comprehensive 
coastal management programmes to reduce 
their vulnerability to A S L R and other impacts 
of global climate change. 
Countries should continue to support relevant 
intergovernmental and intemational organizations 
and programmes and their members should 
continue to: 
(1) 
support research and observations on A S L R 
and related severe storms, (e.g., under the 
Global Ocean Observing System and the Global 
Climate Observing System) and on other coastal 
impacts of global climate change (e.g., coastal 
inundation and habitat destruction resulting 
from changes in the frequency and intensity of 
severe storms): 
(2) 
assist developing countries in building their 
own national capacity to participate in intema-
tional activities on research and observations in 
these areas: 
(3) 
support research on cost-effective response 
measures to assist coastal nations to adapt to the 
adverse impacts of global climate change; 
(4) 
promote public education and initiatives which 
increase awareness of the implications of A S L R 
and other potential impacts of global climate 
change on coastal resources and of the feasibil-
ity of response options to mitigate or adapt to 
those impacts; 
(5) 
strengthen national, regional and international 
programmes and institutions, with a view to 
coordinating the assessment of the vulnerabili-
ty of coastal areas to A S L R and the needs, in 
this regard, of developing countries for assis-
tance; and 
(6) 
recognize the effectiveness of a world-wide 
cooperation between coastal nations and inter-
national organizations as has been developed 
under the I P C C framework, and to give further 
support to the C Z M S and its network as a 
catalyst for strengthening worid-wide coopera-
tion by data and information exchange, 
technology cooperation, integrated coastal zone 
management, training programmes and com-
munications. 
FUTURE ACTIVITIES 
The following C Z M S future activities are proposed: 
The C Z M S envisages producing additional global 
vulnerability assessment reports working jointly 
with Working Group I and Working Group II, and 
in cooperation with other relevant United Nations 
organizations. Because of the close links between 
impacts and response strategies, the C Z M S has 
coordinated with WGII, which has a major focus on 
the concem impacts of climate change, including 
A S L R , on coral and mangrove ecosystems and on 
commercial and subsistence fisheries. The focus of 
C Z M S is to identify response options to manage 
these resources to reduce their vulnerability to A S L ; 
The development of C Z M guidelines,as being 
discussed in the United Nations Conference on 
E n v i r o n m e n t and D e v e l o p m e n t process, in 
cooperation with U N E P by the year 1994; 
IPCC Second Assessment Report (1994 or 1995) In 
cooperation with W G I and WGII, complete a global 
assessment of the vulnerability of coastal areas to 
A S L R , as a first step to C Z M p l a n i n g and 
programs, using the Common Methodology; and 
Support Coastal Zone Management Planning, in 
cooperation 
with 
the 
U N E P 
and 
other 
organizations, and provide technical cooperation, as 
requested, to assist coastal countries to develop 
integrated coastal management plans by the year 
2000. 
In order to execute the above-mentioned activities, it would 
be necessary to seek funding for the work of IPCC C Z M S 
as mentioned in the recommendations. 
Further analysis 
should be made to assess the availability of funds from 
U N E P , other intemational organizations and donor countries 
and the pace and scope of work which could thereby be sup-
ported. Intemational cooperation is essential for the success 
of these activities.

SECTION VII 
RESUME OF THE POLICYMAKER SUMMARY (1990) OF THE IPCC SPECIAL 
COMMITTEE ON THE PARTICIPATION OF DEVELOPING COUNTRIES 
INTRODUCTION 
The IPCC, in its sixth session (Geneva, 29-31 October 
1991 ), decided that a resume of the recommendations of its 
Special Committee on the Participation of Developing 
Countries would be included in the 1992 IPCC Supplement. 
Further, it "agreed with the Chairman's proposal that the 
IPCC Secretariat be tasked to draft the resume from the 
Policymaker Summary of the Special Committee (see the 
IPCC First Assessment Report, 1990) for review by all 
countries". This contribution is the result of that decision. 
Resume of the Executive Summary of the 
Special Committee 
Full participation includes the development of national 
competence to address all issues of concem such as the 
appreciation of the scientific basis of climate change, the 
potential impacts on society of such change and evaluations 
of practical response strategies for national/regional appli-
cations. 
Actions to promote the full participation of the developing 
countries in climate change issues should not await the out-
come of negotiations on the Framework Convention on 
Climate Change. They need to be taken now, through exist-
ing arrangements and should be planned and carried out for 
several years. 
The factors identified by the Special Committee as inhibit-
ing the full participation of the developing countries in the 
IPCC process, inter alia, are: 
• insufficient information; 
• insufficient communication; 
• limited human resources; 
• institutional difficulties; 
• limited financial resources. 
(i) 
Insufficient information: Many developing coun-
tries do not have sufficient information on the 
issue of potential climate change to appreciate the 
concern it evokes elsewhere in the world. 
Information is often insufficient with respect to the 
scientific basis for concem, on the potential phys-
ical and socio-economic impacts of climate change 
as well as on response options. This applies not 
only to scientific milieux but also to policymakers 
and public opinion. 
(ii) 
Insufficient communication: Even if the situation 
with respect to information were to improve, there 
is the problem of insufficient internal and extemal 
communication mechanisms for the proper dis-
semination of the information on matters related to 
climate change. 
(iii) 
Limited human resources: Lack of adequate num-
ber of trained personnel in almost all areas ranging 
from academic, scientific efforts to applications of 
knowledge to food and energy production, to 
water management, to human settlements prob-
lems, to trade and economic growth, and to a host 
of other related endeavours is common to many 
developing nations. Most of them, if not all, can 
command only limited pool of experts and respon-
sible and knowledgeable officials, and even that 
only in a few of these areas. 
(vi) 
Institutional difficulties: The multi-disciplinary 
and cross-cutting nature of the issues involved 
demands relatively high degree of co-ordination 
among the various departments/ ministries of gov-
ernments. 
(v) 
Limited financial resources: Survival needs come 
first. After that, the limited financial, and conse-
quent general lack of technological, resources 
dictate the priorities. Means of meeting the incre-
mental costs of ensuring a viable environment 
frequently cannot be found. Also, local immedi-
ate, environmental concerns generally receive 
political priority over impersonal, global concems. 
The legitimate concerns on the part of the developing coun-
tries that, although their impact on global climate change is 
minimal, its impact on them can be grave, need to be taken 
into account. 
RECOMMENDED ACTIONS 
Uninterrupted travel assistance to the developing countries 
for attendance at the meetings of IPCC and follow-up activ-
ities should be ensured. The Special Committee called the 
attention of the Panel to the importance of continuing this 
effort and of the donor nations continuing and increasing 
their financial support to the effort. 
Serious consideration should be given to supporting more 
than one expert from each participating developing coun-
try to those climate-change-related meetings that deal with 
several aspects of the problem. 
Govemments and organizations from the industrialized 
nations are encouraged to continue and increase their efforts 
41 

in organizing seminars. Developing countries could orga­
nize, under the sponsorship of intemational organizations or 
otherwise, regional seminars and workshops in order to 
exchange scientific and technical information. For this pur­
pose, necessary programmes and lists of experts should be 
developed. As part of the continuing process of information 
exchange, the Special Committee recommended that IPCC 
circulate the P o l i c y m a k e r Summary (of the Special 
Committee) to all concemed. The developing countries on 
their part could where appropriate designate focal points, as 
soon as possible, for transmittal of reports, documentation, 
data and information on seminars. Such focal points should 
be briefed on forwarding the material to appropriate recip­
ients within the nation for response, review etc. 
The establishment of mechanisms for national co-ordination 
of all (national) activities related to climate change could be 
considered by the developing countries. The mechanisms 
could aid such areas as information dissemination, devel­
opment and implementation of plans for research and 
monitoring, and formulation of policy options. The indus­
trialized countries could consider assisting the developing 
countries in setting up the mechanisms. 
The Special Committee recommended that acquisition, anal­
yses and interpretation of information on climatic and 
related data would enable developing countries to take more 
effective account of climate change considerations in for­
mulating national policies. Such actions are necessary also 
at regional levels to undertake and refine impact studies. 
The current unevenness in the acquisition and use of such 
data which is evident between the hemispheres should be 
eliminated. The Special Committee further recommended 
that the developing countries take immediate action to iden­
tify their specific financial needs in this regard. It would also 
be necessary to mobilize appropriate funding in order to 
mount a sustained programme and create regional centres to 
organize information networks on climate change. 
In many developing countries the meteorological/ hydro-
logical service is the main and often the only institution 
collecting and recording data with relevance to climate. If 
associated weather pattems arc modified, as some predict 
they would as a result of climate change, then the capabil­
ities of such services need to be reinforced to enhance their 
contributions to sustainable development. 
The Special Committee further recommended that its find­
ings be duly taken into account in all relevant areas of the 
work of IPCC. Programmes of action should be developed 
and implemented (and the concepts which would lead to 
such programmes of action developed where needed) with­
out delay, with a view to ensure, provided the necessary 
means are made available, the full participation of devel­
oping countries in the future work and activities on climate 
change. 
U N E P and W M O should take the lead in this 
regard and initiate the necessary consultations. Other mul­
tilateral or bilateral organizations should also be contacted 
for elaborating and implementing these programmes of 
action. 
SECTION VIII. 
SUMMARY OF COMMENTS AND ISSUES FOR FURTHER CONSIDERATION 
BROUGHT OUT AT THE SEVENTH SESSION OF IPCC 
Discussion of the result,s described in the reports of the 
three Working Groups identified a number of areas for pri­
ority emphasis in the future work of IPCC. In the plenary 
meetings, references were made to issues and recent work 
not fully taken into account or peer-reviewed during the 
preparation of the Working Groups' supplementary reports. 
A l l available studies should be thoroughly peer-reviewed as 
part of the IPCC follow-up process. 
Desertification 
Climate change and drought and desertification are issues 
of great importance in many parts of the world. Extensive 
study of the links between climatic variations, climate 
change and desertification is urgent and has been request­
ed by numerous affected countries in Sahelian and other 
parts of Africa, in Latin America, and in Australia, India. 
China and other parts of Asia. Desertification is a complex 
phenomenon largely associated with human causes such as 
land degradation exacerbated by climatic variability; the 
affected arid and semi-arid regions are therefore most like­
ly to be vulnerable to climate change. The declaration fol­
lowing the Intemational Congress on Impacts of Climate 
Variations and Sustainable Development in Semi-Arid 
Regions (Fortaleza. Brazil. 1992)) emphasizes the urgency 
of addressing the issue of desertification in respect of its 
causes of observed impacts on affected human societies. 
Fluorinated greenhouse gas species, not 
included in the Montreal Protocol 
There are two species concerned: firstly, the hydrofluoro-
carbons (HFCs), now replacing the chlorofluorocarbons 
(CFCs); secondly, some fully fluorinated species with high 
G W P s and very long lifetimes such as tetrafluoromethane 
(CF^), hexafluoroethane (С,Е^) and sulphur hexafluoride 
(SFg). Consideration should be given to achieving a better 
understanding of sources and sinks and to including these 
gases in the IPCC methodology for national inventories of 
greenhouse gas emissions and sinks, as well as to assessing 
response options. 
42 

Regional climate predictions 
The Panel continued to stress that research leading to infor-
mation on likely regional climate change (and its association 
with global change) was of the highest priority, and noted 
that there are certain aspects of regional climate change 
which are particularly important in some areas. 
Among 
these are tropical cyclones and the tidal surges associated 
with such storms. Guidance on likely changes in frequen-
cy, intensity and distribution of such events, as a result of 
climate change. Is urgently needed in states in and border-
ing the Pacific. Indian and Atlantic Oceans. 
Special 
attention should be given to the needs of small island states 
which are particularly vulnerable to climate change. 
Prediction of regional precipitation is another area of par-
ticular concern. Moreover, the connections between local, 
regional and global pollution requires further study. 
The question of the validity of the technique of palaeo-ana-
logue for the prediction of regional climate change was 
raised. Although, palaeo-data conceming past climate are 
of great value, clear analogues from the past which can be 
applied to future climate change have not yet been identi-
fied. In the further work of IPCC, all methods of regional 
climate prediction should be reviewed and assessed on a 
continuing basis. 
Country studies and methodologies 
The Panel recognized the valuable work on methodologies 
for country studies - such as those for national inventories 
of greenhouse gas emissions and sinks, vulnerability to sea 
level rise and other impacts assessments - which were being 
carried out by the three Working Groups and elsewhere. It 
acknowledged that this is a cross-cutting issue. It recog-
nized the utility of further work on methodologies for both 
limitation and adaptation and. in particular, their integration 
into a broader framework. There was a consensus that pri-
ority should be given to further assessing the work in 
progress and to development of coherent guidelines for 
country studies, keeping in mind the circumstances of dif-
ferent countries and the evolving nature and pattern of their 
natural resource use. The next step in this process should 
be the convening of a workshop possibly prior to the eighth 
Session of the Panel, with a report to be reviewed at that 
time. 
Nuclear energy technologies 
Nuclear power, along with safety and waste disposal issues, 
should be fully evaluated by the IPCC as an alternative 
energy source to mitigate climate change. 
Inventory of possible response options 
Future work should include the preparation of a broad inven-
tory of possible response options to identify an evolving list 
of measures that countries may wish to consider in their 
national context. With regard to each option, the invento-
ry should include feasibility factors that will enable coun-
tries to assess the applicability of an individual option to 
national situations. These factors include 
• technical factors 
• economic factors 
• other factors 
that may Inhibit the introduction of these technologies or 
practices in a specific national situation. 
The options considered should include management prac-
tices, techniques and technologies, and should cover all 
sectors, including energy, industry, transportation, agricul-
ture and forestry as well as adaptation measures for natural 
and developed areas. 
The Technology Characterization Inventory is the first step 
towards this goal. The report on task 4 also identifies spe-
cific response options, and the repon on task 5 notes coastal 
zone management practices that can facilitate adaptation 
to sea-level rise. 
Natural gas prospects 
The concem over the future availability of natural gas to 
meet expected higher demand, including its relation to 
reducing greenhouse gas emissions, was raised. Assessment 
of natural gas availability, deliverability and demand beyond 
the year 2005 is needed, particulariy in non-OECD coun-
tries. 
Economic impacts of response measures 
Some studies very recently became available and could not 
be considered by the IPCC in the review described in this 
report. These studies indicate mixed results and show the 
need for a continuing examination of the question of the 
effects of carbon taxes and other measures on national G D P 
growth. 
Other areas to be considered for future work 
Specification of a minimum set of parameters for 
m o n i t o r i n g for impact analyses, and how to 
measure them. 
Impacts on mountain ecosystems (forests, water 
resources, socio-economic impacts, etc.). 
Impacts of climate change on urban areas and other 
human 
settlements. 
Indirect GWPs. 
• 
Monitoring and databases. 
• 
Further follow-up on the Noordwijk afforestation 
targets. 
43 

Emissions from road transportation and other 
transportation sectors which could be used as 
alternative options. 
• 
Development of an action plan to fulfil 
the 
recommendations of the IPCC Special Committee on 
the Participation of Developing Countries, especially 
the long-term objectives (see section VII). 
Dissemination of IPCC information 
With financial support provided by some countries, the 
IPCC has conducted a series of information exchange sem-
inars in several developing countries, and the IPCC First 
Assessment Report (1990) and some other IPCC reports 
have been translated into several languages. Non-govern-
mental organizations are also contributing significantly to 
the dissemination of information on climate change. The 
seminars have attracted participation from all levels of soci-
ety, including heads of state and government ministers, 
experts, non-governmental organisations and the public. 
They have contributed significantly to the understanding of 
the various aspects of the climate change issue. Further 
seminars in other developing countries could be undertak-
en in response to requests, but this depends on the 
availability of financial and human resources. 
Resource issues 
The I P C C assessments are fundamentally dependent on 
research and development carried out under intemational 
programmes and by research teams within countries of the 
world. The need to increase these research efforts has 
become obvious in the course of the I P C C work. 
Insufficient knowledge and understanding of both the cli-
mate change issue itself as well as all socio-economic 
impacts and further societal implications exist at all levels 
of society. The 
I P C C strongly urges that increasing 
resources be made available for these activities and that the 
major international global programmes be adequately 
resourced. It is particularly important that means are made 
available to permit developing countries to become genuine 
partners in this global research effort. The progress of our 
understanding is indeed dependent upon addressing the 
global environment in its entirety.
