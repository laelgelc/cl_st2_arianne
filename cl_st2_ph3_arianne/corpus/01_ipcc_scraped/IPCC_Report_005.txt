Policymaker Summary of Working Group III 
(Formulation of Response Strategies) 
Chairman's Introduction 
The First Plenary Meeting of Working Group III of the IPCC, 
the Response Strategies Working Group (RSWG), was held in 
Washington, 30 January—2 February 1989. This meeting was 
largely organizational (see Figure 1 ), and it was not until after 
a subsequent R S W G Officers Meeting in Geneva, 8—12 May 
1989. that the real work by the four R S W G subgroups, the 
Emissions Scenarios Task Force (Task A), and "Implementation 
Measures"' Topic Coordinators (Task B) began. 
The Second R S W G Plenary Session was held in Geneva, from 
2 to 6 October 1989, to discuss the implementation measures: 
1) 
public education and information; 
2) 
technology development and transfer: 
3) 
financial measures: 
4) 
economic measures; and 
5) 
legal measures, including elements of a framework 
climate convention. A consensus was reached on five 
topical papers dealing with these measures, with the 
understanding that they would be "living documents" 
subject to further modification as new information and 
developments might require. 
The Third Plenary Meeting of R S W G , held in Geneva, 5—9 
June 1990, achieved three objectives: 
I ) 
It reached consensus on the attached "policy summary"', 
the first intenm report of the R S W G . 
2) 
It completed final editing and accepted the reports of the 
four R S W G subgroups, of the coordinators of Task A , and 
of the coordinators of the five Task В topical papers. 
These documents compnse the underlying material for the 
consensus report of this meeting, the policymaker 
summary; they are not themselves the product of a 
R S W G plenary consensus although many govemments 
participated in their formulation. 
Finally. 
3) 
The Working Group agreed to submit comments on its 
suggested future work programme to the R S W G 
Chairman by I July 1990, for transmission to the Chair 
of the IPCC. There was general agreement that the work 
of the R S W G should continue. 
The primary task of the R S W G was, in the broad sense, 
technical, not political. The charge of IPCC to R S W G was to 
lay out as fully and fairiy as possible a set of response policy 
options and the factual basis for those options. 
Consistent with that charge, it was not the puфose of the 
R S W G to select or recommend political actions, much less to 
carry out a negotiation on the many difficult policy questions 
that attach to the climate change issue, although clearly the 
information might tend to suggest one or another option. 
Selection of options for implementation is appropriately left to 
the policymakers of govemments and/or negotiation of a 
convention. 
The work of R S W G continues. The Energy and Industry 
Subgroup has. since the June R S W G Plenary Meeting, held 
another very productive meeting in London, the results of 
which are not reflected in this report. 
It should be noted that quantitative estimates provided in the 
report regarding CFCs, including those in Scenario A (Business-
as-Usual), generally do not reflect decisions made in June 
1990 by the Parties to the Montreal Protocol. Those decisions 
accelerate the timetable to phase out production and 
consumption of CFCs, halons, carbon tetrachloride and methyl 
chloroform. 
It should further be noted that quantitative estimates of forestry 
activities (eg, deforestation, biomass burning, including fuel 
wood, and other changes in land-use practices), as well as 
agncultural and other activities, provided in the Report continue 
to be reviewed by experts. 
Two specific items of unfinished business submitted to R S W G 
by the Ministers at the November 1989 meeting in Noordwijk 
are the consideration of the feasibility of achieving: (1) targets 
to limit or reduce CO2 emissions, including e g a 20 percent 
reduction of CO2 emission levels by the year 2005; (2) a world 
net forest growth of 12 million hectares a year in the beginning 
of the next century. The R S W G hopes to complete this analysis 
before the Second World Climate Conference in November of 
this year. 
The subgroup chairs and topic coordinators look the 
responsibility for completing their individual reports and. along 
with their respective govemments, contributed generously of 
their time and resources to that end. 
The R S W G Policymaker Summary is the culmination of the 
first year of effort by this body. The R S W G has gone to 
considerable lengths to ensure that the summary accurately 
reflects the work of the vanous subgroups and tasks. Given the 
very stnct time schedule under which the R S W G was asked to 
work, this first report can only be a beginning.

Formulation of Response Strategies 
Executive Summary 
1. 
Working Group III (Response Strategies Working 
Group) was tasked to formulate appropriate response 
strategies to global climate change. This was to be done in 
the context of the work of Working Group I (Science) and 
Working Group II (Impacts) which concluded that: 
"We are certain emissions resulting from human 
activities are substantially increasing the atmospheric 
concentrations of the greenhouse gases: carbon 
dioxide, methane, chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and 
nitrous oxide. These increases will enhance the 
greenhouse effect, resulting on average in an additional 
warming of the Earth's surface. 
"The longer emissions continue at present day rates, 
the greater 
reductions would have to be for 
concentrations to stabilize at a given level. 
"The 
long-lived gases would require immediate 
reductions in emissions from human activities of over 
60% to stabilize their concentrations at today's levels. 
"Based on current model results, we predict under the 
I P C C Business-as-Usual emissions of greenhouse 
gases, a rate of increase of global mean temperature 
during the next century of about 0.3°C per decade 
(with an uncertainty range of 0.2°C to 0.5°C per 
decade), greater than that seen over the past 10,000 
years; under the same scenario, we also predict an 
average rate of global mean sea level rise of about 6 
cm per decade over the next century (with an 
uncertainty range of 3—10 cm per decade). 
"There are many uncertainties in our predictions 
particularly with regard to the timing, magnitude and 
regional pattems of climate change. 
"Ecosystems affect climate, and will be affected by a 
changing climate and by increasing carbon dioxide 
concentrations. Rapid changes in climate will change 
the composition of ecosystems; some species will 
benefit while others will be unable to migrate or adapt 
fast enough and may become extinct. Enhanced levels 
of carbon dioxide may increase productivity and 
efficiency of water use of vegetation. 
"In many cases, the impacts will be felt most severely 
in regions already under stress, mainly the developing 
countries. 
"The most vulnerable human settlements are those 
especially exposed to natural hazards, e g, coastal or 
river flooding, severe drought, landslides, severe 
storms and tropical cyclones". 
2. 
Any responses will have to take into account the 
great diversity of different countries" situations and their 
responsibility for and negative impacts on different countries 
and consequently would require a wide variety of responses. 
Developing countries for example are at widely varying 
levels of development and face a broad range of different 
problems. They account for 75% of the world population 
and their primary resource 
bases differ 
widely. 
Nevertheless, they are most vulnerable to the adverse 
consequences of climate change because of limited access 
to the necessary information, infrastructure, and human and 
financial resources. 
Main findings 
3. 
The main findings are: 
i) 
Climate change is a global issue; effective responses 
would require a global effort which may have a 
considerable impact on humankind and individual 
societies. 
ii) 
Industrialized countries and developing countries have 
a common responsibility in dealing with problems 
arising from climate change. 
ii) 
Industrialized countries have specific responsibilities 
on two levels: 
a) major part of emissions affecting the atmosphere at 
present originates in industrialized countries where 
the scope for change is greatest. Industrialized 
countries should adopt domestic measures to limit 
climate change by adapting their own economies in 
line with future agreements to limit emissions; 
b) to co-operate with developing countries in 
intemational action, without standing in the way of the 
latter's development, by contributing additional 
financial resources, by appropriate transfer of 
technology, by engaging in close co-operation 
concerning scientific observation, by analysis and 
research, and finally by means of technical co-
operation geared to forestalling and managing 
environmental problems. 
iv) 
Emissions from developing countries are growing and 
may need to grow in order to meet their development 
requirements and thus, over time, are likely to 
represent an increasingly significant percentage of 
global emissions. Developing countries have the 
responsibility, within the limits feasible, to take 
measures to suitably adapt their economies. 
v) 
Sustainable development requires the proper concem 
for environmental protection as the necessary basis 
for continuing economic growth. 
Continuing 
economic development will increasingly have to take 
into account the issue of climate change. 
It is 
imperative that the right balance between economic 
and environmental objectives be struck. 
117 

Formulation of Response Strategies 
Vl) 
Limitation and adaptation strategies must 
be 
considered as an integrated paci<age and should 
complement each other to m i n i m i z e net costs. 
Strategies that limit greenhouse gases emissions also 
make it easier to adapt to climate change. 
vii) 
The potentially serious consequences of climate 
change on the global environment give sufficient 
reasons to begin by adopting response strategies that 
can be justified immediately, even in the face of 
significant uncertainties. 
viii) A well-infonmed population is essential to promote 
awareness of the issues and provide guidance on 
positive practices. The social, economic and cultural 
diversity of nations will require tailored approaches. 
A flexible and progressive approach 
4. 
Greenhouse gas emissions from most sources are 
likely to increase significantly m the future if no response 
measures are taken. 
Although some controls have been 
put in place under the Montreal Protocol for C F C s and 
halons, emissions of C O , , CH4, N , 0 and other gases such 
as several CFC-substitutes w i l l grow. 
Under these 
scenarios, it is estimated that C O , emissions will increase 
from approximately 7 billion (or 1,000 million) tonnes 
carbon (BtC)in 1985 to between 11 — 15 B t C by 2025. 
Similarly, man-made methane emissions are estimated to 
increase from about 300 teragrams (Tg) to over 500 Tg by 
the year 2025. Based on these projections. W o r k i n g 
Group 1 estimated that global warming of 0.3°C/decade 
could occur. 
5. 
The climate scenario studies of Working Group I 
further suggest that control policies on emissions can indeed 
slow global warming, perhaps from 0 . 3 ° C / d e c a d e to 
0.1 °C/decade. The social, economic and environmental 
costs and benefits of these control policies have not been 
fully assessed. It must be emphasized that implementation 
of measures to reduce global emissions are very difficult as 
energy use, forestry, and land use patterns are primary 
factors in the global economy. To take maximum advantage 
of our increasing understanding of scientific and 
socioeconomic aspects of the issue, a flexible and 
progressive approach is required. Subject to their particular 
circumstances, individual nations may wish to consider 
taking steps now to attempt to limit, stabilize or reduce the 
emission of greenhouse gases resulting from human 
activities and prevent the destruction and improve the 
effectiveness of sinks. One option that govemments may 
wish to consider is the setting of targets for CO2 and other 
greenhouse gases. 
6. 
Because the -large, projected increase in world 
population will be a major factor in causing the projected 
increase in global greenhouse gases, it is essential that global 
climate change strategies include strategies and measures to 
deal with the rate of growth of the worid population. 
Shorter-term 
1. 
The Working Group has identified measures at 
the national, regional and intemational levels as applicable 
which, while helping to tackle climate change, can yield 
other benefits. 
8. 
Limitation 
Improved energy efficiency reduces emissions of 
carbon dioxide, the most significant greenhouse gas, 
while improving overall economic performance and 
reducing other pollutant emissions and increasing 
energy security. 
Use of cleaner energy sources and technologies 
reduces carbon dioxide emissions, while reducing 
other pollutant emissions that give rise to acid rain and 
other damaging effects. 
• 
Improved forest management and, where feasible, 
expansion of forest areas as possible reservoirs of 
carbon. 
Phasing out of C F C s under the Montreal Protocol, 
thus removing some of the most powerful and long-
lived greenhouse gases, while also protecting the 
stratospheric ozone layer 
Agnculture, forestry and other human activities are 
also responsible for substantial quantities of 
greenhouse gas emissions. 
In the short term, 
reductions can be achieved through improved livestock 
waste management, altered use and formulation of 
fertilizers, and other changes to agricultural land use, 
without affecting food security, as well as through 
improved management m landfill and wastewater 
treatment. 
9. 
Adaptation 
• 
Developing emergency and disaster preparedness 
policies and programmes. 
Assessing areas at risk from sea-level rise and 
developing comprehensive management plans to 
reduce future vulnerability of populations and coastal 
developments and ecosystems as part of coastal zone 
management plans. 
Improving the efficiency of natural resource use, 
research on control measures for desertification and 
enhancing adaptability of crops to saline regimes. 
Longer-term 
10. 
Governments should prepare for more intensive 
action which is detailed in the report. To do so, they should 
undertake now: 
118 

Formulation of Response Strategies 
Accelerated and coordinated research programmes to 
reduce scientific and socioeconomic uncertainties with 
a view towards improving the basis for response 
strategies and measures. 
Development of new technologies in the fields of 
energy, industry and agriculture. 
• 
Review planning m the fields of energy, industry, 
transportation, urban areas, coastal zones and resource 
use and management. 
Encourage beneficial behavioral and structural (eg, 
transportation and housing infrastructure) changes. 
• 
Expand the global ocean observing and monitonng 
systems. 
11. 
It should be noted that no detailed assessments 
have been made as of yet of the economic costs and benefits, 
technological feasibility or market potential of the 
underlying policy assumptions. 
International cooperation 
12. 
The measures noted above require a high degree of 
international cooperation with due respect for national 
sovereignty of states. The international negotiation on a 
framework convention should start as quickly as possible 
after the completion of the IPCC First Assessment Report. 
This, together with any additional protocols that might be 
agreed upon, would provide a firm basis for effective 
cooperation to act on greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to 
any adverse effects of climate change. 
The convention 
should, at a minimum, contain general principles and 
obligations. It should be framed in such a way as to gain the 
adherence of the largest possible number and most suitably 
balanced range of countries while permitting timely action 
to be taken. 
13. 
Key issues for negotiation will include the criteria, 
timing, legal form and incidence of any obligations to 
control the net emissions of greenhouse gases, how to 
address equitably the consequences for all, any institutional 
mechanisms that may be required, the need for research 
and monitoring, and in particular, the request of the 
developing countries for additional financial resources and 
for the transfer of technology on a preferential basis. 
Further consideration 
14. 
The issues, options and strategies presented in this 
document are intended to assist policymakers and future 
negotiators in their respective tasks. Further consideration 
of the summary and the underlying reports of Working 
Group III should be given by every govemmeni as they cut 
across different sectors in all countries. It should be noted 
that the scientific and technical information contained in the 
Policymaker Summary and the underlying reports of 
Working Group III do not necessarily represent the official 
views of all govemments, particulariy those that could not 
participate fully in all Working Groups.

Sources of anthropogenic 
greenhouse gases 
1.0.1 
A wide range of human activities result in the 
release of greenhouse gases, particularly CO2, CH4. C F C s 
and N , 0 . into the atmosphere. Anthropogenic emissions 
can be categorized as arising from energy production and 
use, non-energy industrial activities (primarily the 
production and use of CFCs), agricultural systems, and 
changes in land-use pattems (including deforestation and 
biomass burning). The relative contributions of these 
activities to radiative forcing during the 1980s are 
discussed in the text and shown in Figure 2 (see Working 
Group I report for further explanation of the radiative 
forcing of the various greenhouse gases; see also the 
C h a i r m a n ' s introduction regarding the quantitative 
estimates of the contributions to radiative forcing from 
these activities). 
1.0.2 
I P C C W o r k i n g G r o u p I calculated that the 
observed increases in the atmospheric concentrations of 
C O i , , C H 4 , C F C s and N j O during the 1980s, which 
resulted from human activities, contributed to the 
enhanced radiative forcing by 56%, 15%, 24% and 5%, 
respectively.

Summary of Working Group I 
1.1 
Energy 
1.1.1 
The single largest anthropogenic source of 
radiative forcing is energy production and use. The 
consumption of energy from fossil fuels (coal, petroleum 
and natural gas excluding fuel wood) for industrial 
commercial, residential, transportation and other purposes 
results in large emissions of CO2 accompanied by much 
smaller emissions of CH4 from coal mining and the 
venting of natural gas; the energy sector accounts for an 
estimated 46% (with an uncertainty range of 38—54%) of 
the enhanced radiative forcing resulting from human 
activities. 
1.1.2 
Natural fluxes of C O i . into the atmosphere are 
large (200 Bt/yr'). but inputs of man-made sources are large 
enough to significantly disturb the atmospheric balance. 
1.2 
Industry 
1.2.1 
The production and use of C F C s and other 
halocarbons in various industrial processes comprise 
about 24% of the enhanced radiative forcing. 
Forestry 
1.2.2 
Deforestation, biomass burning including fuel 
wood, and other changes in land-use practices, release 
CO2. CH4, and N2O into the atmosphere and together 
comprise about 18% (with an uncertainty range of 
9—26%) of the enhanced radiative forcing. 
' Billion (or 1000 million) tonnes per year 
Agriculture 
1.2.3 
Methane releases from rice cultivation and from 
livestock systems, and nitrous oxide released during the use 
of nitrogenous fertilizers together comprise about 9% (with 
an uncertainty range of 4—13%) of the enhanced radiative 
forcing. 
Other sources 
1.2.4 
Carbon dioxide from cement manufacturing and 
methane from land-fills together comprise about 3% (with 
an uncertainty range of 1—4%) of the enhanced radiative 
forcing. 
1.2.5 
Estimates of current greenhouse gas emissions are 
not precise because of uncertainties regarding both total 
emissions and emissions from individual sources. Global 
emissions from certain sources are particularly difficult to 
determine, e g. CO2 emission from deforestation, CH4 
emission from rice cultivation, livestock systems, biomass 
buming, coal mining and venting of natural gas, and N2O 
emissions from all sources. The range of such estimates 
can be quite large, typically, a factor of 1.5 for methane from 
livestock, a factor of 4 for CO2 from deforestation, and up 
to a factor of 7 for rice. 
2. 
Future emissions of greenhouse 
gases 
2.0.1 
Greenhouse gas emissions from most sources are 
likely to increase significantly in the future if no policy 
120 

Formulation of Response Strategies 
measures are taken. As economic and'population growth 
continue, in particular in the developing countries, there is 
expected to be an increase in energy use, industrial and 
agricultural activity, deforestation, and other activities which 
result in a net increase of greenhouse gas emissions. 
Although some controls have been put in place under the 
Montreal Protocol for certain C F C s and halons, emissions 
of CO2, methane, nitrous oxide, and other greenhouse gases 
are likely to increase under current pattems of economic 
activity and growth. 
2.0.2 
However, because of the inherent limitations in our 
ability to estimate future rates of population and economic 
growth, etc, there is some'uncertainty in the projections of 
greenhouse 
gas 
emissions, 
individual 
behaviour, 
technological innovation, and other factors which are crucial 
for determining emission rates over the course of the next 
century. This lends uncertainty to projections of greenhouse 
gas emissions over several decades or longer. Reflecting 
these inherent difficulties, the R S W G ' s work on emissions 
scenarios are the best estimates at this time covering 
emissions over the next century but further work needs to be 
done. 
2.0.3 
The R S W G used two methods to develop 
scenarios of future emissions as discussed in Sections 2.1. 
and 2.2. One method used global models to develop four 
scenarios which were subsequently used by Working Group 
I to develop estimates of future warming. The second 
method used studies of the energy and agriculture sectors 
submitted by over 21 countries and 
international 
organizations to estimate emissions. These latter studies 
were aggregated into a reference scenario. Both approaches 
show that emissions of C O , and CH4 will increase in the 
future. Both approaches indicate that CO2 emissions will 
grow from approximately 7 BtC to between 11 —15 BtC by 
the year 2025. 
2.1 
Emissions scenarios 
2.1.1 
One of the R S W G ' s first tasks was to prepare 
some initial scenarios of possible future greenhouse gas 
emissions for the use of the three IPCC Working Groups. 
A n experts" group was formed which looked at four 
hypothetical future pattems of greenhouse gas emissions 
and their effect on the atmosphere. The cumulative effect 
of these emissions was calculated using the concept of 
equivalent CO2 concentrations (e g, the contributions of all 
greenhouse gases to radiative forcing are converted into 
their equivalent in terms of C02Concentrations). Global 
economic growth rates were taken from W o r l d Bank 
projections and population estimates were taken from U N 
studies and assumed equal for all scenarios. 
2.1.2 
The first of the scenarios, called the Business-as-
Usual or the 2030 High Emissions Scenario, assumes that 
few or no steps are taken to limit greenhouse gas emissions. 
Energy use and clearing of tropical forests continue and 
fossil fuels, in particular coal, remain the world's primary 
energy source. The Montreal Protocol comes into effect but 
without strengthening and with less than 100 percent 
compliance. 
Under this scenario, the equivalent of a 
doubling of pre-industrial C O , levels occurs, according to 
Working Group I, by around 2025. 
2.1.3 
The predicted anthropogenic contributions to 
greenhouse gas emissions in 2025 are shown in Table 1. 
The R S W G attempted to synthesize and compare the results 
of the A F O S / E I S Reference Scenario and the Task A 
"Business-as-Usual" (or "2030 High Emissions") Scenario 
(see figure 3). The figure shows the equivalent CO2 
concentrations for the Task A "Business-as-Usual" Scenario 
and the AFOS/EIS Reference Scenario with its higher C O , 
emissions and the C F C phaseout agreed to by the Parties to 
the Montreal Protocol. The results indicate that the C O , 
equivalent concentrations and thus the effect ori the global 
climate are similar for both scenarios. 
2.1.4 
The second of the scenarios, the 2060 L o w 
Emissions 
Scenario, assumes that 
a 
number 
of 
environmental and economic concems result in steps to 
reduce the growth of greenhouse gas emissions. Energy 
efficiency measures, which might only be possible with 
government intervention, are implemented, emissions 
controls are adopted globally, and the share of the world's 
primary energy provided by natural gas increases. 
Full 
compliance with the Montreal Protocol is achieved and 
tropical deforestation is halted and reversed. Under this 
scenario, the cumulative effect of such measures is a C O , 
equivalent doubling around 2060. 
2.1.5 
The remaining two scenarios reflect futures where 
steps in addition to those in the 2060 L o w Emissions 
Scenario are taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 
These steps include rapid utilization of renewable energy 
sources, strengthening of the Montreal Protocol, and 
adoption of agricultural policies to reduce emissions from 
livestock systems, rice paddies, and fertilizers. 
2.1.6 
A l l of the above scenarios provide a conceptual 
basis for considering possible future pattems of emissions 
and the broad responses that might affect those pattems. 
However, they represent assumptions rather than cases 
derived from specific studies. In addition, no full assessment 
was made as yet of the total economic costs and benefits, 
technological feasibility, or market potential of the 
underlying policy assumptions. 
2.2 
Reference scenario 
2.2.1 
Table 2 shows the results of the EIS Reference 
Scenario (for CO2 emissions from the energy sector only) 
divided by region. The table is incomplete and does not 
include CO2 emissions from non-energy sources nor other 
greenhouse gases and sinks. While it is not directly a 
measure of a region's climate forcing contribution, this table 
does portray a future where, in the absence of specific policy 
measures, global emissions of one major gas, CO2, grow

- The estimates for emissions of CFCs in 1985 and 2025 reflect the decisions taken at the meeting of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol 
in London in June 1990. At that meeting, the parties agreed to accelerate the phase out of the production and consumption of CFCs, halons, 
carbon tetrachloride and methyl chloroform. 
з Midrange estimates for deforestation and biomass consistent with preferred value from Working Group I 
•* Assuming low biomass per hectare and deforestation rates. 
Differences in the 1985 emissions figures are due to differences in definitions and qualifying the emissions from these particular sources.

from5.15 B t C i n 1985, to 7.30 BtC in 2000 and 12.43 BtC 
in 2025. 
Primary energy demand more than doubles 
between 1985 and 2025, an average annual growth rate of 
2.1%. 
2.2.2 
The annual rate of growth in CO2 emissions varies 
between 0.7% in Western Europe, 1.3% in North America 
and the Pacific O E C D Countries, and 3.6% in developing 
countries. The share of emissions between regions varies 
over time. 
2.2.3 
Under this scenario, the per capita emissions in the 
industrialized countries increase from 3.1 tonnes carbon 
(TC) per capita in 1985 to 4.7 T C per capita in 2025. For 
the developing countries, the per capita emissions rise from 
0.4 T C per capita in 1985 to 0.8 T C per capita in 2025. 
2.2.4 
The Reference Scenario sets out an example of 
the scope of the reductions in total global emissions which 
might be necessary to stabilize or reduce C O , emissions. 
The stabilization of global emissions at 1985 levels would 
require reductions of 29% by 2000 and 59% by 2025. A 
reduction of global emissions to 20% below 1985 levels 
would require reductions of 44% in 2000 and 67% by 2025. 
2.2.5 
The carbon intensity figures show, for each region, 
the amount of carbon emitted per unit of energy consumed. 
The contribution of energy consumption in a region to global 
warming is largely a function of its carbon intensity, total 
fuel use, and of the efficiency with which it consumes fossil 
fuels. Carbon intensity for industrialized countries changes 
from 16.3 tonnes carbon per gigajoule (TC-GJ) in 1985 to 
15.5 in 2025. In the developing worid the change is from 
14.2 T C - G J to 15.6. 
3. 
Response strategies for 
addressing global climate 
change 
3.0.1 
Because climate change could potentially result 
in significant impacts on the global environment and human 
activities, it is important to begin considering now what 
measures might be taken in response. 
Working Group I 
found that under a "Business-as-Usual" scenario global 
average temperature could rise by 0.3 degrees centigrade per 
decade; it also found that under the Accelerated Control 
Policies Scenario (scenario D) with extremely stringent 
emissions reductions the temperature rise could perhaps be 
reduced to 0.1 degree centigrade per decade. The R S W G 
identified a wide range of options for the intemational 
community to consider. These include measures both to 
limit net greenhouse gas emissions and to increase the ability 
of society and managed ecosystems to adapt to a changing 
climate. 
3.0.2 
Strategies which focus only on one group of 
emission sources, one type of abatement option or one 
particular greenhouse gas will not achieve this. Policy 
responses should, therefore, be balanced 
against 
altemative abatement options among the energy, industry, 
forestry and agricultural sectors, and adaptation options 
and other policy goals where applicable at both national 
and international levels. Ways should be sought to 
account for other countries, and intergenerational issues, 
when making policy decisions. 
3.0.3 
The consideration of climate change response 
strategies, however, presents formidable difficulties for

policymakers. On the one hand, the information available 
to make sound policy analyses is inadequate because of: 
(a) 
remaining scientific uncertainties regarding the 
magnitude, timing, rate, and regional consequences 
of potential climate change; 
b) 
uncertainty with respect to how effective specific 
response options or groups of options would be in 
actually averting potential climate change; and 
(c) 
uncertainty with respect to the costs, effects on 
economic growth, and other economic and social 
implications of specific response options or groups of 
options. 
3.0.4 
The potentially serious consequences of climate 
change on the global environment, however, give sufficient 
reasons to begin by adopting response strategies that can be 
justified immediately even in the face of such significant 
uncertainties. 
124 

Formulation of Response Strategies 
3.0.5 
Recognizing these factors, a large number of 
options were preliminarily assessed. It appears that some of 
these options may be economically and socially feasible 
for implementation in the near-term while others, because 
they are not yet technically or economically viable, may be 
more appropriate for implementation in the longer-term. In 
general, the R S W G found that the most effective response 
strategies, especially in the short-term, are those which are: 
beneficial for reasons other than climate change and 
justifiable in their own right, for example increased 
energy efficiency and lower greenhouse gas emission 
technologies, better management of forests and other 
natural resources, and reductions in emissions of CFCs 
and other ozone depleting substances that are also 
radiatively important gases: 
economically efficient and cost effective, in particular 
those that use market-based mechanisms: 
able to serve multiple social, economic, and 
environmental puфoses; 
flexible and phased, so that they can be easily modified 
to respond to increased understanding of scientific, 
technological and economic aspects of climate change: 
economic growth and the concept of sustainable 
development; 
administratively practical and effective in terms of 
application, monitoring, and enforcement; and 
reflecting obligations of both industrialized and 
developing countries in addressing this issue, while 
recognizing the special needs of developing countries, 
in particular in the areas of financing and technology. 
3.0.6 
The degree to which options are viable will also vary 
considerably depending on the region or country involved. For 
each country, the implications of specific options will depend 
on its social, environmental, and economic context. Only 
through careful analysi.s of all available options will it be 
possible to determine which are best suited to the 
circumstances of a particular country or region. Initially, the 
highest priority should be to review existing policies with a 
view to minimizing conflicts with the goals of climate change 
strategies. New policies will be required. 
4. 
Options for limiting greenhouse 
gas emissions 
4.0.1 
The R S W G reviewed potential measures for 
mitigating climate change by limiting net emissions of 
greenhouse 
gases 
from 
the 
energy, 
industry, 
transportation, housing and building, forestry, agriculture, 
and other sectors. 
These measures include those which 
limit emissions from greenhouse gas sources (such as 
energy production and use), those which increase the use 
of natural sinks (such as immature forests and other 
biomass) for sequestering greenhouse gases, as well as 
those measures aimed at protecring reservoirs such as 
existing forests. 
While R S W G was not mandated to 
consider the role of the oceans. Working Group I noted 
that oceans also play an equally important role as sinks 
and reservoirs for carbon dioxide. A discussion of both 
short and long-term options for each major emissions 
sector is provided below. 
4.0.2 
It also should be recognized that the large, 
projected increase in the world population, to as much as ten 
billion people during the next century, will be a major factor 
in causing the projected increase in global greenhouse gases. 
This is because larger populations will be accompanied by 
increased consumption of energy and of food, more land 
clearing, and other activities, all of which will cause an 
increase in net greenhouse gas emission. It is essential, 
therefore, that policies designed to deal effectively with the 
issue of potential global climate change include strategies 
and measures to reduce the rate of growth of the world 
population. 
4.1 
Limitation of net emissions from the 
energy sector 
4.1.1 
The energy sector plays a vitally important role in 
economic well-being and development for all nations. At 
the same time, because energy production and use accounts 
for approximately one half of the radiative forcing from 
human activities, energy policies need to ensure that 
continued economic growth occurs in a manner that, 
globally, conserves the environment for future generations. 
However, there is no single, quick-fix technological option 
for limiting greenhouse gas emissions from energy sources. 
A comprehensive strategy is necessary which deals with 
improving efficiency on both the demand and supply sides 
as a priority and emphasizes technological research, 
development, and deployment. 
4.1.2 
The R S W G recognizes the particular difficulties 
which will be faced by countries, particularly developing 
countries, whose economy is heavily dependent on the 
production and/or export of fossil fuels, as a consequence of 
actions taken by other countries to limit or reduce energy 
related greenhouse gas emissions. These difficulties should 
be taken into account when elaborating international 
strategies. 
4.1.3 
Various potential options have been identified for 
reducing greenhouse gas emissions from energy systems. 
The most relevant categories of options appear to be: 
efficiency improvements and conservation in energy 
supply, conversion, and end use; 
• 
fuel substitution by energy sources which have lower 
or no greenhouse gas emissions;

Formulation of Response Strategies 
• 
reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by removal, 
recirculation or fixation; 
management and behavioural changes (e.g. increased 
work in homes through information technology) and 
structural changes (e.g. modal shift in transport). 
4.1.4 
From an analysis of the technologies in these 
categories, it appears that some technologies are available 
now or in the short-term 
while others need further 
development 
to lower costs or to improve 
their 
environmental characteristics. 
4.1.5 
Tables 3 and 4 provide various examples of 
technological options within each of the broad categories 
defined above, and their possible application in the short, 
medium, and longer-term. This distinction among time 
frames is used in order to reflect the remaining technological 
needs in each category and to assist in formulating 
technological strategies. Short-term technologies are those 
which apparently are or will be both technically and 
economically ready for introduction and/or demonstration 
up to the year 2005 and beyond. Mid-term technologies are 
those which, while technically available now. are not yet 
economic and thus may not be implemented until the period 
from 2005 to 2030. Longer-term technologies are not yet 
available but may emerge after 2030 as a result of research 
and development. Such time frames could be influenced by 
such factors as the pace of the technological changes and 
economic conditions. 
4.1.6 
The technical, economic, and market potential of 
technological options will vary depending upon the sector 
in which they are to be applied. The technical potential of 
an energy technology is its capacity to reduce potential 
emissions, irrespective of the costs involved, and is largely 
a function of technical feasibility and resource availability. 
Economic potential refers to whether the application of the 
options is economically efficient and cost-effective—it may 
be significantly less than technical potential where there 
are positive resource costs. 
Market potential refers to 
whether the consumer or user is likely to adopt the option— 
it might be even less than economic potential due to market 
imperfections, attitudes to risk, and the presence of non-
monetary costs. 
4.1.7 
There is, in general, extensive information 
available on the technical potential of the 
many 
technological options listed. For example: 
in the Transportation sector, vehicle efficiency 
improvements have very high technical potential (e.g. 
50 percent improvement from the average vehicle on 
the road in some countries); 
in the Electricity Generation sector, efficiency 
improvements of 15 to 20 percent could be achieved 
for retrofits of coal plants and up to 65 percent for new 
generation versus average existing coal plants; fuel 
substitution could achieve 30 percent (for oil to natural 
gas) to 40 percent (for coal to natural gas) reduction in 
emissions of CO2; 
• 
in the Buildings sector, new homes could be roughly 
twice as energy efficient and new commercial 
buildings up to 75 percent as energy efficient as 
existing buildings; retrofitting existing homes could 
average 25 percent 
improvement and existing 
commercial buildings around 50 percent; 
• 
in the Industry sector, the technical potential for 
efficiency improvements ranges from around 15 
percent in some sub-sectors to over 40 percent in 
others (i.e. the best available technology versus the 
stock average). 
4.1.8 
The constraints to achieving the technical potential 
in these sectors can be generally categorized as: 
capital costs of more efficient technologies vis-à-vis 
the cost of energy; 
relative prices of fuels (for fuel substitution); 
lack of infrastructure; 
• 
remaining performance drawbacks of alternative 
technologies; 
replacement rates; 
reaching the large number of individual decision-
makers involved. 
4.1.9 
Each of these constraints may be more or less 
significant depending on the sector in question. While not 
a constraint, behavioural changes (eg, improved driver 
behaviour, better vehicle maintenance and turning off 
unused lights) can make significant contributions to 
emissions reduction in all sectors. Achieving such changes 
requires the engagement of both the energy supplier and the 
consumer. Likewise, improvements in operational practices 
on the part of industry and govemment (e.g. better traffic 
management or boiler operation) offer significant potential 
but require increased attention. 
Transport and housing 
policies (e.g. promotion of public transport, home insulation) 
could also reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 
A more 
comprehensive assessment of the measures to overcome 
these constraints is contained in section 7 of this 
Policymaker Summary. 
4.1.10 
Factors external to the energy sector also 
significantly constrain potential. These include the difficulty 
of: 
making basic changes in the structure of economies 
(e.g. development of new transportation and housing 
infrastructure); 
130 

Formulation of Response Strategies 
• 
making fundamental changes in attitudinal and social 
factors (e.g. preferences for smaller and higher 
efficiency vehicles). 
4.1.11 
The challenge to policymakers is to enhance the 
market uptake of technological options and behavioural and 
operational changes as well as to address the broader issues 
outside the energy sector in order to capture more of the 
potential that exists. 
Options and strategies 
4.1.12 
Tables 3 and 4 summarize the technological, 
regulatory, and institutional approaches which could form 
elements of strategies to control greenhouse gases. 
4.1.13 
A list of options recommended by EIS as measures 
for addressing greenhouse gas emissions is given below. 
Countries are encouraged to evaluate the social, economic 
and environmental consequences of these options. 
• 
taking steps now^ to attempt to limit, stabilize or 
reduce the emission of energy-related 
greenhouse 
gases and prevent the destruction and improve the 
effectiveness of sinks. One option that govemments 
may wish to consider is the setting of targets for CO2 
and other greenhouse gases; 
• 
adopting a flexible progressive approach, based on 
the 
best 
available scientific, economic 
and 
technological knowledge, to action needed to respond 
to climate change; 
• 
drawing up specific policies and implementing wide-
ranging comprehensive programmes which cover all 
energy-related greenhouse gases; 
starting with implementing strategies which have 
multiple social, economic and environmental benefits, 
are cost effective, are compatible with sustainable 
development and make use of market forces in the 
best way possible: 
• 
intensifying intemational, multilateral and bilateral 
co-operation in developing new energy strategies to 
cope with climate change. 
In this 
context, 
industrialized countries are encouraged to promote 
the development and the transfer of energy-efficient 
and clean technologies to other countries; 
increasing public awareness of the need for external 
environmental costs to be reflected in energy prices, 
markets and policy decisions to the extent that they can 
be determined; 
<> There was significant concem expressed at the RSWG meeting 
about the immediacy implied by the word now in option one, when 
implementation could only be considered al a rate consistent with 
countries' level of knowledge and particular circumstances. 
increasing public awareness of energy-efficiency 
technologies and products and altematives, through 
public education and information (e.g. labelling); 
strengthening 
research 
and development 
and 
intemational collaboration in energy technologies, and 
economic and energy policy analysis, which are 
relevant for climate change; 
encouraging the participation of industry, the general 
public, and NGOs in the development and implement-
ation of strategies to limit greenhouse gas emissions. 
Short-term strategy options 
4.1.14 
Short-term strategies for all individual nations 
include: 
improving diffusion of energy-efficient and altemanve 
energy technologies which are technically and 
commercially proven; 
• 
improving energy efficiency of mass produced goods 
including motor vehicles and electrical appliances and 
equipment and buildings (eg, through improved 
standards); 
developing, diffusing and transferring technologies to 
limit energy-related greenhouse gas emissions; 
reviewing energy-related price and tariff systems and 
policy decisions on energy planning to better reflect 
environmental costs. 
Long-term strategy options 
4.1.15 
Over the longer term, sustainable development 
will remain a central theme of policies and strategies. 
Specific approaches within a sustainable development policy 
framework will evolve as our understanding of climate 
change and its implications improves. 
4.1.16 
Long-term strategies for all individual nations 
include: 
accelerating work to improve the long-term potential 
of efficiency in the production and use of energy; 
encouraging a relatively greater reliance on no or lower 
greenhouse gas emissions energy sources and 
technologies; and enhancing natural and man-made 
means to sequester greenhouse gases: 
further reviewing, developing and deploying policy 
instmments, which may include public information, 
standards, taxes and incentives, tradeable permits, and 
environmental impact assessments, which will induce 
sustainable energy choices by producers 
and 
consumers without jeopardizing energy security and 
economic growth; 
131 

Formulation of Response Strategies 
developing methodologies to evaluate the trade-off 
between limitation and adaptation strategies and 
establishing changes in infrastructure (e.g. pipelines, 
electrical grids, dams) needed to limit or adapt to 
climate change. 
4.2 
Limitation of net emissions from the 
industry sector 
4.2.1 
The most significant source of greenhouse gases 
associated with industrial activity not related to energy 
use is the production and use of C F C s and other 
halocarbons. C F C s represent a very important source of 
greenhouse gas emissions and account for about 24% of 
the total contributions to the enhanced radiative forcing 
for the period of the 1980s. 
While the R S W G did not 
consider control strategies for these gases since the issue 
is already addressed under the Montreal Protocol on 
Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, it noted that the 
review of the Montreal Protocol now under way should 
take mto account the global w a r m i n g potential of 
potential C F C substitutes. 
4.2.2 
The R S W G did develop future emission scenarios 
for C F C s and H C F C - 2 2 (HCFC-22 was used as a surrogate 
for a potential mix of H C F C s and H F C s substitutes). The 
potential impact of such substitutes on radiative forcing 
was assessed by Working Group I. For a given emission rate, 
H C F C s and HFCs are less effective greenhouse gases than 
the C F C s because of their shorter lifetimes. The growth 
rates assumed in the I P C C scenarios will result in the 
atmospheric concentrations of HFCs and H C F C s becoming 
comparable to the C F C s during the next several decades 
assuming that the C F C s had continued to be used at current 
rates. Assuming the IPCC scenarios for HFCs and H C F C s , 
W o r k i n g Group I calculated that these gases would 
contribute up to 10% of the total additional radiative forcing 
for the period 2000—2050. 
4.3 
Limitation of net emissions from the 
agriculture sector 
4.3.1 
About 9 percent of anthropogenic 
greenhouse 
gas emissions can be attributed to the agricultural sector, 
in particular livestock systems, rice cultivation, and the 
use of nitrogenous fertilizers. Limitation of emissions 
from this sector presents a challenge because the 
processes by which greenhouse gases, in particular 
methane and nitrous oxide, are released in agricultural 
activities are not well understood. 
In addition, response 
options in the agricultural sector must be designed to 
ensure maintenance of food supply. 
There appear, 
however, to be a number of short-term response options, 
some economically beneficial in their own right, which 
could contribute to a limitation of net emissions from 
agricultural sources. 
Where appropriate the removal of 
subsidies, incentives and regulatory barriers that 
encourage 
greenhouse 
gas 
e m i s s i o n s 
from 
the 
agricultural sector would be both environmentally and 
economically beneficial. In addition, there are a number 
of promising technologies and practices which, in the 
longer term, could significantly reduce greenhouse gas 
emissions. 
Short-term options: 
4.3.2 
Livestock systems- Methane emissions could be 
reduced through improved management of livestock 
wastes, expansion of supplemental feeding practices, and 
increased use of production and growt-enhancing agents 
with safeguards for human health. 
4.3.3. 
Fertilizer use- Nitrous oxide emissions may be 
reduced by using existing improved fertilizer formulations, 
judicious use of animal manures and compost, and improved 
application technology and practices. 
4.3.4 
Marginal lands: Areas marginally suitable for 
annual cropping systems may be shifted to perennial cover 
crops for fodder, pastoral land uses or forests if soils are 
suitable. Such actions would increase carbon uptake, both 
in the vegetation and soil, and would yield other benefits. 
4.3.5 
Sustainable 
agricultural 
practices: 
Where 
possible, m i n i m u m or n o - t i l l systems should be 
introduced for those countries currently using tillage as 
part of the annual cropping sequence, thus maintaining 
and increasing soil organic matter. 
Longer-term options: 
4.3.6 
Rice cultivation: A comprehensive approach, 
including management of water regimes, improvement of 
c u l t i v a r s , efficient use of fertilizers, and 
other 
management practices, could lead to a 10 to 30 percent 
reduction in methane emissions from flooded rice 
cultivation although substantial research is necessary to 
develop and demonstrate these practices. 
It is estimated 
that at least 20 years would be needed to introduce such 
practices. Adaptable altemative crops research is needed 
to provide a more diverse crop base for rice growing 
regions. 
4.3.7 
Livestock: Through a number of technologies it 
appears that methane emissions may be reduced from 
livestock systems by up to 25—75 percent per unit of 
product in dairy and meat production, although many 
uncertainties exist. 
4.3.8 
Fertilizers: 
Fertilizer-derived emissions of 
nitrous oxide potentially can be reduced (although to what 
extent is uncertain) through changes in practices such as 
using fertilizers with controlled nitrogen conversion rates, 
i m p r o v i n g fertilizer-use e f f i c i e n c y , and adopting 
altemative agricultural systems where possible. 
4.3.9 
Desertification: Enhanced research on control 
measures. 
132 

Formulation of Response Strategies 
4.4 
Limitation of net emissions from 
forestry and other activities 
4.4.1 
Forestry and related aspects of land use cannot be 
considered in isolation, and solutions must be based on an 
integrated approach which links forestry to other policies, 
such as those concerned with poverty and land resources, 
which should be supported by strong institutions in order to 
enhance overall forest management. The forest crisis is 
rooted in the agricultural sector and in people's needs for 
employment and income. Deforestation will be stopped 
only when the natural forest is economically more valuable 
for the people who live in and around the forests than 
alternative uses for the same land. 
4.4.2 
Forestry practices and other human activities 
associated with land use, such as biomass burning and 
landfills, account for about 18 percent of anthropogenic 
greenhouse gas emissions. A number of short and long-term 
response options for limiting net emissions from these 
sectors have been identified. 
Short-term options: 
4.4.3 
Improvement of forest-management and reduction 
of deforestation and forest degradation which should be 
supported by: 
reduction of air pollution which contributes to forest 
degradation; 
• 
elimination of inappropriate economic incentives and 
subsidies that contribute to forest loss, where 
appropriate; 
• 
integration of forest conservation requirements and 
sustainable development in all relevant sectors of 
national development planning and policy, taking 
account of the interests of local communities; 
co-ordinated remote sensing, data collection and 
analyses to provide the required data; 
• 
a meeting o f interested countries from the 
developing and the industrialized worlds and of 
appropriate international agencies to identify 
possible key elements of a world forest conservation 
protocol in the context of a climate convention 
process that also addresses energy supply and use, 
and practical means of implementing it. Such a 
meeting should also develop a framework and 
methodology for analyzing the feasibility of the 
Noordwijk remit including alternative targets, as 
well as the full range of costs and benefits; 
strengthening the Tropical Forestry Action Plan 
(TFAP) and in the light of the independent review 
which is being undertaken, the Intemational Tropical 
Timber Organization (ITTO), and other intemational 
organizations whose objective is to help developing 
countries in achieving conservation, and sustainable 
development and management of forests; 
• 
an assessment of incentives and disincentives for 
sustainable forest management, for example, the 
feasibility of labelling; 
introduction of sustainable forest harvesting and 
management; 
development of enhanced regeneration methods; 
development and implementation of (large-scale) 
national afforestation and forest conservation plans, 
where feasible. 
4.4.4 
Where appropriate expand forest areas, especially 
by afforestation, agroforestry and regreening of available 
suфlus agricultural, urban and marginal lands. 
4.4.5 
Where appropriate strengthen and improve the use 
of forest products and wood through measures such as 
substituting a portion of fossil energy sources by wood or 
other sustainable managed biomass; partial replacement of 
high energy input materials by wood; further recycling of 
forest products; and improved efficiency of use of fuel 
wood. 
4.4.6 
Development of methane recovery systems for 
landfill and waste water treatment facilities and their use. in 
particular, in industrialized countries 
Longer-term options: 
4.4.7 
Maintain the health and the continuance of existing 
forests as major natural carbon reservoirs, especially 
through the development and implementation of: 
silvicultural adjustment and stress management 
strategies; 
• 
special forest protection strategies (developed under 
climate change scenarios); 
• 
environmentally sound treatment practices for 
peatlands; 
standardization of methods of forest inventory and 
bio-monitoring to facilitate global forest management. 
4.4.8 
Expand forest biomass, especially of intensively 
managed temperate forests, by silviculture measures and 
genetically improved trees. 
4.4.9 
With regard to waste management, use of gas 
collection and flaring to reduce methane emissions from 
landfills and development of biogas plants to reduce 
methane 
emissions from 
wastewater 
treatment. 
133 

Formulation of Response Strategies 
Demonstration, training and technology transfer are 
necessary to realize these potentials, which may range 
from 30 to 90 percent for landfills and up to 100 percent 
for wastewater treatment. 
5. 
Further work on greenhouse 
gas emission limitation loals 
5.0.1 
There has been considerable international 
d i s c u s s i o n of targets for specific greenhouse gas 
emissions, in particular, C O , , which is the most abundant 
of the greenhouse gases. The final declaration at the 
November 1989 Noordwijk Conference on Atmospheric 
Pollution and Climate Change encouraged the I P C C to 
include in its First Assessment Report an analysis of 
quantitative targets to limit or reduce CO2 emissions, and 
urged all industrialized countries to investigate the 
feasibility of achieving such targets, including, for 
example, a 20 percent reduction of CO2 emissions by the 
year 2005. The Conference also called for assessing the 
feasibility of increasing net global forest growth by 12 
million hectares per year. 
During its Third Plenary, the 
I P C C accepted the mandate. 
5.0.2 
Although the feasibility of quantitative targets on 
greenhouse gas emissions fell within the R S W G ' s original 
mandate through its Energy and Industry Subgroup (EIS), 
it was agreed that these new, specific tasks would require 
more time, data and analyses in order to be dealt with 
properly. It was decided, therefore, that the results of the 
deliberations of the EIS on these remits could not be fully 
included in its report, but only treated in an incomplete and 
preliminary way. A progress report is to be presented to the 
Fourth IPCC Plenary following an international workshop 
to be hosted by the United Kingdom in June 1990. As for the 
Noordwijk remit on global forest growth, the R S W G 
through its Agriculture, Forestry and Other Human 
Activities Subgroup (AFOS) noted that a framework and 
methodology for analyzing its feasibility should be 
developed. 
5.0.3 
While the technical potential of a number of 
options has been demonstrated, there is very little 
information available on the actual economic and social 
feasibility associated with implementation of such options. 
A n adequate understanding of the benefits, in terms of 
changes in climate variables that are avoided, is also 
seriously lacking. It is imperative that further work on the 
cost and benefit implications of response strategies be 
undertaken. These issues have been identified as one of the 
most important areas for future research by the R S W G , 
concerned international organizations, and individual 
countries. 
5.0.4 
The material available to the EIS demonstrates the 
important role emissions of industrialized countries play in 
total global emissions in the near term. The material also 
indicates that the technical potential for reduction is large. 
and differs greatly between regions and countries. Therefore, 
in the near term, no significant progress in limiting global 
emissions will occur without actions by the industrialized 
countries. Some countries have already decided to stabilize 
or reduce their emissions. 
6. 
Measures for adapting to 
global climate change 
6.0.1 
In addition to the limitation options discussed 
above, the R S W G reviewed measures for adapting to 
potential climate change. The consideration of adaptation 
options is critical for a number of reasons. First, because it 
is believed that there is likely to be a lag time between 
emissions and subsequent climate change, the climate may 
already be committed to a certain degree of change. 
Implementation of adaptation measures may thus be 
necessary regardless of any limitation actions which may be 
taken. Secondly, natural climatic variability 
itself 
necessitates adaptation. 
6.0.2 
Furthermore, should significant adverse climate 
change occur, it would be necessary to consider limitation 
and adaptation strategies as part of an integrated package in 
which policies adopted in the two areas complement each 
other so as to minimize costs. Limitation and adaptation 
options should be developed and analyzed recognizing the 
relationship between the timing and costs of limitation and 
adaptation. 
For example, the more net emissions are 
reduced and the rate of climate change potentially slowed, 
the easier it would be to adapt. A truly comprehensive 
approach should recognize that controlling the different 
gases might have different effects on the adaptive capacity 
of natural resources. 
6.0.3 
The R S W G explored two broad categories of 
adaptation options: 
Coastal zone management, or options which maximize 
the ability of coastal regions to adapt to the projected 
sea level rise and to reduce vulnerability to storms; and 
Resource use and management, or options which 
address the potential impacts of global climate change 
on food security, water availability, natural and 
managed ecosystems, land, and biodiversity. 
6.1 
Coastal zone management 
6.1.1 
Under the 2030 high emissions scenario, global 
climate change is predicted to raise global mean sea level 65 
cm (with an uncertainty range of 30 to 100 cm) by the year 
2100. If sea level rises by 1 metre, hundreds of thousands 
of square kilometres of coastal wetlands and other lowlands 
could be inundated, while ocean beaches could erode by as 
much as a few hundred metres over the next century. 
Flooding would threaten lives, agriculture, livestock, and 
structures, while saltwater would advance inland into 
134 

Formulation of Response Strategies 
aquifers, estuaries, and soils, thus threatening water supplies 
and agriculture in some areas. Loss of coastal ecosystems 
would threaten fishery resources. 
6.1.2 
Some nations would be particularly vulnerable to 
such changes. Eight to ten million people live within one 
metre of high tide in each of the unprotected river deltas of 
Bangladesh, Egypt, and Vietnam. Half a million people live 
in coral atoll nations that lie almost entirely within three 
metres of sea level, such as the Maldives, the Marshal 
Islands, Tuvalu, Kiribati, and Tokelau. Other states with 
coastal areas, archipelagos and island nations in the Pacific 
and Indian Oceans and the Caribbean could lose much of 
their beaches and arable lands, which would cause severe 
economic and social disruption. 
6.1.3 
Available responses to sea-level rise fall broadly 
into three categories: 
Retreat: Under this option no actions would be taken 
to protect the land from the sea—the focus would 
instead be on providing for people and ecosystems to 
shift landward in an optimal fashion. This choice 
could be motivated by either excessive costs of 
protection or by a desire to maintain ecosystems. 
Accommodation: Under this strategy, while no attempt 
would be made to protect the land at risk, measures 
would be taken to allow for continued habitation of the 
area. 
Specific responses under this options would 
include erecting flood shelters, elevating buildings on 
pilings, converting agriculture to fish farming, or 
growing flood- or salt-tolerant species. 
Protection: A protection strategy uses site-specific 
features such as sea walls, dikes, dunes, and vegetation 
to protect the land from the sea so that existing land 
uses can be retained. 
6.1.4 
There are various environmental, economic, 
social, cultural, legal, institutional and technological 
implications for each of these options. Retreat could lead 
to a loss of property, potentially costly resettlement of 
populations, and. in some notable cases, 
refugee 
problems. 
Accommodation could result in declining 
property values, and costs for modifying infrastructure. 
Protecting existing development from a one metre sea 
level rise would require about 360,000 kilometres of 
coastal defences at. a total cost of US$ 500 billion, over 
the next 100 years. 
The annual cost of protection 
represents, on average, 0.04 percent of total gross national 
product (GNP). and ranges from zero to 20 percent for 
individual countries. The estimate is not discounted and 
does not reflect present coastal defence needs or impacts 
of salt water intrusion or flooding of unprotected lands. 
Further, the protection could have negative impacts on 
fisheries, wildlife and recreation. The loss of traditional 
environments could potentially disrupt family life and 
create social instability. 
Actions to prepare for possible sea level rise 
6.1.5 
A number of response options are available which 
not only enhance the ability of coastal nations to adapt to sea 
level rise, but are also beneficial in their own right. 
Implementation of such options would be most effective if 
undertaken in the short-term, not because there is an 
impending catastrophe, but because there are opportunities 
to avoid adverse impacts by acting now—opportunities 
which may not be as effective if the process is delayed. 
These options include: 
National coastal planning: 
Development and implementation in the short term 
of comprehensive national coastal zone management 
plans which (a) deal with both sea level rise and other 
impacts of global climate change and (b) ensure that 
risks to populations are minimized while recognizing 
the need to protect and maintain important coastal 
ecosystems. 
Identification of coastal areas at risk. National efforts 
are needed to (a) identify functions and resources at 
risk from a one metre rise in sea level and (b) assess 
the implications of adaptive response measures on 
them. 
Provisions to ensure that coastal development does 
not increase vulnerability to sea-level rise. Actions 
in particular need of review include river levees and 
dams, conversions of mangroves and other wetlands 
for agriculture and human habitation, harvesting of 
coral and increased settlement in low-lying areas. In 
addition, while structural measures to prepare for 
sea-level ri.se are not yet warranted, the design and 
location of coastal infrastructure and coastal 
defenses should include consideration of sea-level 
rise and other coastal impacts of climate change. It 
is somerimes less expensive to design a structure 
today, incoфorating these factors, than to rebuild it 
later. 
Review and strengthening of emergency preparedness 
and coastal zone response mechanisms. Effons are 
needed to develop emergency preparedness plans for 
reducing vulnerability to coastal storms through better 
evacuation planning and the development of coastal 
defense mechanisms that recognize the impact of sea 
level rise. 
/nternational cooperation : 
Maintenance of a continuing intemational focus on 
the impacts of sea-level rise. Existing intemational 
organizations should be augmented 
with new 
mechanisms to focus attention and awareness on sea-
level change and to encourage the nations of the worid 
to develop appropriate responses. 
135 

Formulation of Response Strategies 
Provision of technical assistance and co-operation to 
developing nations. 
Institutions offering financial 
support should take into account the need for technical 
assistance and co-operation in developing coastal 
management plans, assessing coastal resources at risk, 
and increasing a nation's ability—through education, 
training, and technology transfer—to address sea level 
rise. 
• 
Support by international organizations for national 
efforts to limit population growth in coastal areas. In 
the final analysis, rapid population growth is the 
underlying problem with the greatest impact on both 
the efficacy of coastal zone management and the 
success of adaptive response options. 
Research, data, and information: 
Strengthening of research on the impacts of global 
climate change on sea-level rise. Intemational and 
national climate research programmes need to be 
directed at understanding and predicting changes in 
.sea-level, extreme events, precipitation, and other 
impacts of global climate change on coastal areas. 
Development and implementation of a global ocean 
observing network, for example through the efforts 
of the I O C , W M O and U N E P , to establish a 
coordinated international ocean observing network 
that will allow for accurate assessment and continuous 
monitoring of changes in the world's oceans and 
coastal areas, particulariy sea-level change and coastal 
erosion. 
Dissemination of data and information on sea-level 
change and adaptive options. 
A n international 
mechanism could be identified with the participation 
of the parties concemed for collecting and exchanging 
data and information on climate change and its impact 
on sea-level and the coastal zone and on various 
adaptive options. Sharing this information with 
developing countries is critically important for 
preparation of coastal management plans. 
6.1.6 
A programme could begin now to enable 
developing 
countries 
to 
implement coastal 
zone 
management plans by the year 2000. The programme would 
provide for training of country experts, data collection and 
technical assistance and co-operation. Estimated funding to 
provide the necessary support over the next 5 years is US$ 
10.000,000. It is suggested that intemational organizations 
such as U N E P and W M O consider co-ordinating this 
programme in consultation with interested nations. 
6.2 
Resource use and management 
6.2.1 
The reports of Working Groups I and II indicate 
significant and unavoidable impacts, both positive and 
negative, upon the very resources that humans and other 
species rely on to live. These resources include water, 
agriculture, livestock, fisheries, land, forests, and wildlife. 
The R S W G addressed these resource issues in the context 
of considering options for ensuring food security; 
conserving biological diversity; maintaining water 
supplies; and using land rationally for managed and 
unmanaged ecosystems. 
6.2.2 
The potential impacts of climate change on natural 
resources and human activities are poorly understood. First, 
credible regional estimates of changes in critical climatic 
factors, such as temperature, soil moisture, annual and 
seasonal variability, and frequencies of droughts, floods 
and storms, are simply not available. For many of these 
critical climatic factors even the direction of change is 
uncertain. Secondly, methods for translating these changes 
into effects on the quantity and quality of resources are 
generally lacking. While it is clear that some of the impacts 
of climate change on resources could be negative and others 
positive, a more specific quantification of those impacts is 
not possible at this time. Nevertheless, these uncertainties do 
not preclude taking appropriate actions, especially if they are 
worthwhile for other non-climate related reasons. However, 
it can be said that: 
(a) 
those resources which are managed by humans (e.g. 
agriculture, forestry) are more suited to successful 
adaptation than unmanaged ecosystems; and 
(b) 
the faster the rate of change, the greater the impact. In 
that regard, it is very important to realize that some 
species will not be able to survive rapid climate 
changes. 
6.2.3 
Through the ages societies and living things have 
developed the capability to adapt to the climate's natural 
variability and to extreme events. Several climatic zones 
span the globe, and resource use and management is an 
ongoing challenge in each of these zones. Therefore, society 
could borrow from this existing large reservoir of experience 
and knowledge in developing policies to adapt to possible 
climate change. In addition, expected future economic and 
technological progress would provide the financial and 
technical resources required to better adapt to a changing 
climate. 
Nevertheless, significant costs, and legal, 
institutional and cultural adjustments may be necessary to 
implement adaptation measures. 
6.2.4 
In recognition of the uncertainties regarding the 
impacts of climate change on resource use and management, 
the following sections provide general, rather than specific, 
options in three categories. The appropriateness of these 
options for individual countries may vary depending on the 
specific social, environmental and economic context. 
Short-term research related options 
6.2.5 
There are a number of actions which would 
augment our knowledge base for making reasoned 
136 

Formulation of Response Strategies 
judgments about response strategies. These include: 
• 
Developing inventories, data bases, monitoring 
systems, and catalogues of the current state of 
resources and resource use and 
management 
practices. 
Improving our scientific understanding of and 
predictive tools for critical climatic factors, their 
impacts on natural resources, and their socio-economic 
consequences. 
Undertaking studies and assessments to gauge the 
resilience and adaptability of resources and their 
vulnerability to climate change. 
Encouraging research and development by both public 
and private enteфrises directed toward more efficient 
resource use and biotechnological innovation (with 
adequate safeguards for health, safety, and the 
environment), including allowing innovators to benefit 
from their work. 
Continuing existing research and development of 
methods 
to cope 
with 
the potentially 
worst 
consequences of climate change, such as developing 
more drought- or salinity-resistant cultivars or using 
classical and modern breeding techniques to help keep 
farming and forestry options open, and research on 
agrometeorology or agroclimatology. 
Increasing research on the preservation of biological 
resources in situ and ex situ, including investigations 
into the size and location of protected natural areas and 
conservation corridors. 
Short-term policy options 
6.2.6 
Some response strategies are available which are 
probably economically justified under 
present-day 
conditions and which could be undertaken for sound 
resource management reasons, even in the absence of 
climate change. In general, these relate to improving the 
efficiency of natural resource use, fuller utilization of the 
"harvested" component of resources, and waste reduction. 
Measures that could be implemented in the short-term 
include: 
Increased emphasis on the development and adoption 
of technologies which may increase the productivity or 
efficiency (per unit of land or water) of crops, forests, 
livestock, fisheries, and human settlements, consistent 
with the principles of sustainable development. Such 
efficiencies reduce the demand for land for human 
activities and could also help reduce emissions of 
greenhouse gases. Examples of specific options 
include more efficient milk and meat production; 
improved food storage and distribution: and better 
water management practices. 
Increased promotion and strengthening of resource 
conservation and sustainable resource use—especially 
in highly vulnerable areas. Various initiatives could be 
explored for conserving the most sensitive and 
valuable 
resources, 
including 
strengthening 
conservation measures, managing development of 
highly 
vulnerable 
resources, 
and 
promoting 
reforestation and afforestation. 
Acceleration of economic development efforts in 
developing countries. Because these countries often 
have largely resource-based economies, efforts at 
improving agriculture and natural resource use would 
be particularly beneficial. Such efforts would also 
promote capital formation, which would generally 
make adaptation to climate change and sustainable 
development more feasible. 
Developing methods whereby local populations and 
resource users gain a stake in conservation and 
sustainable resource use, for example by investing 
resource users with clear property rights and long-
term tenure, and allowing voluntary water transfer or 
other market mechanisms. 
Decentralizing, as practicable, decision-making on 
resource use and management. 
Longer-term options 
6.2.7 
There are also a number of other possible 
responses which are costly or otherwise appear to be more 
appropriate for consideration in the longer term, once 
uncertainties regarding climate change impacts are reduced. 
Options in this category include: 
Building large capital structures (such as dams) to 
provide for enhanced availability of water and other 
resources. 
Strengthening and enlarging protected natural areas 
and examining the feasibility of establishing 
conservation corridors to enhance the adaptation 
prospects for unmanaged ecosystems. 
As appropriate, reviewing and eliminating direct and 
indirect subsidies and incentives for inefficient 
resource use, and other institutional barriers to efficient 
resource use. 
7. 
Mechanisms for implementing 
response strategies 
7.0.1 
The R S W G also considered several priority areas 
which must be addressed in order to adequately implement 
limitation or adaptation responses. These "implementation 
mechanisms" represent the primary vehicles through which 
national, regional and intemational responses to climate can 
137 

Formulation of Response Strategies 
be brought into force. The specific implementation 
mechanisms considered were: 
• 
public information and education; 
• 
technology development and transfer; 
economic (market) mechanisms; 
financial 
mechanisms; 
• 
legal and institutional mechanisms, including possible 
elements of a framework convention on climate 
change. 
7.0.2 
The results of the R S W G ' s deliberations on these 
issues are provided below. 
7.1 
Public information and education 
7.1.1 
A well informed global population is essential for 
addressing and coping with an issue as complex as climate 
change. Because climate change would affect, either directly 
or indirectly, almost every sector of society, broad global 
understanding of the issue will facilitate the adoption and 
implementation of such response options as deemed 
necessary and appropriate. The dissemination of information 
also represents a powerful economic instrument for ensuring 
that markets accurately take into account potential 
consequences and/or opportunities of climate change. 
7.1.2 
The core aims of public education and information 
programmes are to: 
promote awareness and knowledge of climate change 
issues; 
provide guidance for positive practices to limit and/or 
adapt to climate change; 
encourage wide participation of all sectors of the 
population of all countries, both developed and 
developing, in addressing climate change issues and 
developing appropriate responses; and 
especially emphasize key target groups, such as 
children and youth, as well as individuals at household 
levels, policymakers and leaders, media, educational 
institutions, scientists, business and agricultural 
sectors. 
7.1.3 
G i v e n the importance of a well-informed 
population, the R S W G developed suggestions 
and 
approaches for improving intemational awareness of the 
potential causes and impacts of climate change. 
In this 
process it was recognized that, while broad-based 
understanding is essential, no single mechanism can work 
for every group or in every culture or country. The social, 
economic, and cultural diversity of nations will likely require 
educational approaches and information tailored to the 
specific requirements and resources of particular locales, 
countries or regions. The importance of education and 
information 
for 
developing 
countries 
cannot 
be 
overemphasized. 
7.1.4 
A number of national and intemational actions 
should be taken to disseminate broadly information on 
climate change. These include the: 
Establishment of national committees or clearing 
houses to collect, develop, and disseminate objective 
materials on climate change issues. This could help 
provide focal points for information on issues such as 
energy efficiency, energy savings, forestry, agriculture, 
etc. 
• 
Use by intemational organizations ( U N E S C O , U N E P , 
W M O , etc.) and non-governmental organizations of 
I P C C and other relevant reports in developing and 
providing to all countries an adequate understanding 
for future actions. 
Use of an existing international institution, or 
development of a new institution, if necessary, to serve 
as a clearing house for informational and educational 
materials. 
Upon completion of the I P C C reports, or eariier, 
arrange a series of short seminars targeted to inform 
high priority decision makers, worid leaders and others 
of causes and effects of climate change. 
7.2 
Technology development and transfer 
7.2.1 
The development and transfer of technologies is 
vital to any effort to address global climate change. The 
development of new technologies may provide the means by 
which societies can meet their energy, food, and other needs 
in the face of changes in global climate, while at the same 
time minimizing emissions of greenhouse gases. Prompt 
transfer of technologies, especially to developing countries, 
is likewi.se an important aspect of any effort to limit or 
adapt to climate change. 
Technology research and development 
7.2.2 
T e c h n o l o g i c a l 
development, 
i n c l u d i n g 
improvement and reassessment of existing technologies, 
is needed to limit or reduce anthropogenic greenhouse gas 
emissions; absorb such gases by protecting and increasing 
sinks; adapt human activities and resource use and 
management to the impacts of climate change; and detect, 
monitor and predict climate change and its impacts. 
Technological development could be pursued in a wide 
range of activities such as energy, industry, agriculture, 
transport, water supply, coastal protection, management 
of 
natural 
resources, 
and housing and 
b u i l d i n g 
construction. 
138 

Formulation of Response Strategies 
7.2.3 
Adequate and trained human resources are a 
prerequisite for development and transfer of technologies, 
and technological actions, founded on a sound scientific 
basis, must be consistent with the concept of sustainable 
development. 
7.2.4 
Criteria for selecting technologies include such 
factors as the existence of economic and social benefits in 
addition to environmental benefits, economic efficiency 
taking into account all the extemal costs, suitability to local 
needs, ease of administration, information needs, 
acceptability to the public. 
7.2.5 
Appropriate pricing policies where applicable, 
information exchange on the state of development of 
technologies, and the support of governments are important 
measures that can promote technology development. Also of 
importance are intemational collaborative efforts, especially 
between the industrialized and the developing countries in 
the bilateral and multilateral context. 
Technology transfer 
l.l.b 
There is a need for the rapid transfer to the 
developing countries, on a preferential basis, of technologies 
for addressing climate change. Developing countries are of 
the view that transfer of technologies on a non-commercial 
basis is necessary and that specific bilateral and multilateral 
arrangements should be established to promote this. Some 
other countries where technologies are not owned by the 
govemment believe that transfer of technologies would be 
a function of commercial negotiations. 
The issue of 
intellectual property rights also presents a case where 
intemational opinion is mixed. 
7.2.7 
A number of impediments also exist which 
hinder the effective transfer of technologies to developing 
countries. 
These include lack of financial resources, 
necessary institutions, and trained human resources. 
Existing institutions could be strengthened, or new 
mechanisms established, where appropriate, to finance 
technology transfers, train human resources, and evaluate, 
introduce and operate existing or new technologies. Legal 
barriers and restrictive trade practices are also impeding 
factors. 
7.2.8 
It has not been possible to bridge the difference of 
views on some of the questions mentioned above. 
It is 
extremely important to reach early intemational agreement 
on these issues in order to promote effective flow of 
technologies to monitor, limit or adapt to climate change. 
One area where intemational agreement may be possible is 
the promotion of C F C substitutes and provision of assistance 
and cooperation to the developing countries in the 
acquisition and manufacture of such substitutes. 
7.2.9 
Several countries have suggested that the issue of 
technology transfer to Eastern European countries be 
addressed. 
7.3 
Economic mechanisms 
7.3.1 
It is important that any potential measures to limit 
or adapt to global climate change be as economically 
efficient and cost-effective as possible, while taking into 
account important social implications. In general, 
environmental objectives can be achieved either through 
regulations requiring the use of a specific technology or 
attainment of specified goals, or economic instruments such 
as emissions fees, subsidies, tradeable permits or sanctions. 
7.3.2 
Economic 
instruments, 
through 
their 
encouragement of flexible selection of abatement measures, 
frequently offer the possibility of achieving environmental 
improvements at lower cost than regulatory mechanisms. 
Unlike many regulations, they tend to encourage innovation 
and the development of improved technologies and practices 
for reducing emissions. Economic mechanisms also have 
the potential to provide the signals necessary for more 
environmentally sensitive operation of markets. 
It is 
unlikely, however, that economic instruments will be 
applicable to all circumstances. 
7.3.3 
Three factors are considered as potential barriers to 
the operation of markets and/or the achievement of 
environmental objectives through market mechanisms. 
These are: information problems, which can often cause 
markets to produce less effective or unfavourable 
environmental outcomes: existing measures and institutions, 
which 
can 
encourage 
individuals to 
behave 
in 
environmentally damaging ways; and balancing competing 
objectives (social, environmental, and economic). A n initial 
response strategy may therefore be to address information 
problems directly and to review existing measures which 
may be barriers. For example, prior to possible adoption of 
a system of emission charges, countries should examine 
existing subsidies and tax incentives on energy and other 
relevant greenhouse-gas-producing sectors. 
7.3.4 
A general advantage of market based economic 
instruments is that they encourage limitations or reductions 
in emissions by those who can achieve them at least cost. 
They aLso provide an ongoing incentive for industry and 
individual consumers 
to apply the most 
efficient 
limitation/reduction measures through, for example, more 
efficient and cleaner technologies. Such incentives may be 
lacking in the case of regulations. 
7.3.5 
Regulations, are the customary means of controlling 
pollution in both market and centrally planned economies. An 
advantage of regulations is that, in certain circumstances, they 
create more certainty as to desired outcomes, whereas major 
disadvantages are that they may discourage innovation, 
introduce inflexibilities in meeting objectives, can discourage 
resource use efficiency, and offer few or no incentives to 
reduce emissions below specified levels. 
7.3.6 
It is evident that the question of adoption of any 
form of economic instrument, whether domestically or 
139 

Formulation of Response Strategies 
internationally, raises many complex and difficult issues. 
Careful and substantive analysis of all implications of 
such instruments is needed. 
Possible specific economic 
instruments which have been identified for consideration 
include: 
• 
A system of tradeable emissions permits: A n 
emission penmit system is based on the concept that 
the 
e c o n o m i c 
costs 
of attaining 
a given 
environmental goal can be minimized by allowing 
for the trading of emissions rights. Once an overall 
limit on emissions has been set, emissions 
entitlements amounting to that limit c o u l d be 
provided to emitting sources and free trading of such 
entitlements allowed. This would reduce the costs 
of meeting a given emission target because: (a) as in 
trade, comparative advantages between trading 
entities would be maximized; and (b) economic 
incentives would be created for the development of 
improved greenhouse gas limitation technologies, 
sink enhancement, and resource use efficiency 
(energy conservation). Concerns with this approach 
include the limited experience with this instrument, 
the potential scope and size of trading markets and 
the need for the development of an administrative 
structure not currently in place. 
• 
A system of emission charges: Emission charges are 
levied on specified emissions depending on their 
level of contribution to climate change. 
Such 
charges may provide a means o f encouraging 
emitters to limit or reduce emissions and provide an 
incentive for diverse parties to implement efficient 
means of limiting or reducing emissions. Another 
advantage of charges is that they generate revenue 
which could provide a funding base for further 
pollution abatement, research, and administration, 
or allow other taxes to be lowered. Concems with 
this approach include the difficulty of deciding on 
the basis and size o f the tax, and the lack of 
certainty that the tax w i l l achieve the agreed 
emission reduction target. 
Subsidies: 
Subsidies are aimed at encouraging 
environmentally sound actions by lowering their 
costs. 
Subsidies c o u l d be used, inter alia, to 
encourage the use of energy-efficient equipment 
and non-fossil energy sources, and the development 
and greater use of e n v i r o n m e n t a l l y 
sound 
technologies. 
Concerns with subsidies include the 
possible size of the required financial commitment 
of governments, the need for careful design, the 
need for review, and the intemational trade aspects 
of such measures. 
Sanctions: A final type of economic instrument is 
the use of economic sanctions for the enforcement of 
international agreements. This would require an 
international convention to establish a system of 
agreed trade or financial sanctions to be imposed on 
countries not adhering to agreed regimes. 
Many 
contributors expressed considerable reservations 
about applying this approach to greenhouse gas 
emissions because of the complexity of the situation. 
The concems include a belief that sanctions could 
appear to be arbitrary, could create confusion and 
resentment and could be used as a pretext to impose 
new non-tariff trade barriers. 
7.3.7 
It has also been suggested that environmental 
protection could be advanced and economic costs of 
meeting greenhouse-gas l i m i t a t i o n targets, i f any, 
m i n i m i z e d by addressing, to the extent feasible, all 
greenhouse gas sources and sinks comprehensively. This 
approach could employ an "index" relating net emissions 
of various greenhouse gases by further development of 
the index formulated by Working Group I. 
7.3.8 
Each of the approaches outlined above, however, 
poses potentially significant challenges in terms of 
implementation and acceptability. There is an incomplete 
understanding of the economic and social consequences 
of these various approaches. 
It is evident that further 
work is required in all countries, and in ongoing I P C C 
work, to fully evaluate the practicality of such measures 
and costs and benefits associated with 
different 
mechanisms, especially with their use intemationally. It 
has, however, been pointed out that an international 
system o f tradeable permits, or, alternatively, an 
intemational system of emissions charges, could offer the 
potential of serving as a cost-efficient main instrument for 
achieving a defined target for the reduction of greenhouse 
gas emissions. 
7.3.9 
Finally, it was stressed that in order to share 
equitably the economic burdens, implementation of any of 
the intemational economic instruments discussed above 
should take into account the circumstances that most 
emissions affecting the atmosphere at present originated 
in the industrialized countries, where the scope for change 
is the greatest, and that, under present conditions, 
emissions from developing countries are growing and 
may need to grow in order to meet their development 
requirements and thus, over time, are likely to represent 
an increasingly significant percentage of global emissions. 
It is appreciated that each instrument assessed has a role 
in meeting greenhouse-gas emission objectives, but the 
suitability of particular instruments is dependent on the 
particular circumstances and at this stage no measure can 
be considered universally superior to any other available 
mechanisms. 
7.4 
Financial meclianisms 
7.4.1 
Industrialized and developing countries consider 
it important that assurances of financial mechanisms are 
needed for undertaking adequate measures to limit and/or 
adapt to climate change. 
140 

Formulation of Response Strategies 
Guiding Principles 
7.4.2 
The following principles should guide the financial 
approach; 
a) 
Industrialized countries and developing countries have 
a common responsibility in dealing with problems 
arising from climate change, and effective responses 
require a global effort. 
b) 
Industrialized countries should take the lead and have 
specific responsibilities on two levels: 
i) 
a major part of emissions affecting the atmosphere 
at present originates in industrialized countries where 
the scope for change is greatest. 
Industrialized 
countries should adopt 
domesdc measures to limit 
climate change by adapting their own economies in 
line with future agreements to limit emissions; 
ii) to cooperate 
with developing countries in 
international action, without standing in the way of the 
latter's development, by contributing additional 
financial resources, by appropriate transfer of 
technology, by engaging in close cooperation 
concerning scientific observation, by analysis and 
research, and finally by means of technical co-operation 
geared to forestalling and managing environmental 
problems; 
c) emissions from developing countries are growing 
and may need to grow in order to meet their 
development requirements and thus, over time, are 
likely to represent an increasingly significant 
percentage of global emissions. Developing countries 
should, within the limits feasible, take measures to 
suitably adapt their economies. 
7.4.3 
Financial resources channelled to developing 
countries would be most effective if focused on those 
activities which contribute both to limiting greenhouse gas 
emissions and promoting economic development. Areas for 
cooperation and assistance could include: 
efficient use of energy resources and the increased use 
of fossil fuels with lower greenhouse gas emission 
rate or non-fossil sources; 
rational forest management practices and agricultural 
techniques which reduce greenhouse gas emissions; 
facilitating technology transfer and technology 
development; 
measures which enhance the capacity of developing 
countries to develop programmes to address climate 
change, including research and development activities 
and public awareness and education; 
participation by developing countries in intemational 
fora on global climate change, such as the IPCC. 
7.4.4 
It was also recognized that co-operation and 
assistance for adaptive measures would be required, noting 
that for some regions and countries, adaptation rather than 
limitation activities are potentially most important. 
7.4.5 
A number of possible sources for generating 
financial resources were considered. These include general 
taxation, specific taxation on greenhouse gas emissions, 
and emissions trading. For the significant complexities and 
implications of such taxes, reference is made to the economic 
measures paper (section 7.3). Creative suggestions include 
using undisbursed official resources, which might result 
from savings on govemment energy bills and lower levels 
of military expenditures, a fixed percentage tax on travel 
tickets, and levies on countries that have been unable to 
meet their obligations. The question has also been raised of 
whether such financial cooperation and assistance should 
only be given to those countries which abstain from activities 
producing greenhouse gases. A positive international 
economic environment, including further reduction of trade 
barriers, and implementation of more equitable trade 
practices would help to generate resources which can be 
applied towards pressing needs. 
7.4.6 
With respect to institutional mechanisms for 
providing financial co-operation and assistance to developing 
countries, a two-track approach was considered: 
i) 
one track built on work under way or planned in 
existing institutions. In this regard, the World Bank, 
a number of regional banks, other multilateral 
organizations, and bilateral agencies have initiated 
efforts to incorporate global climate change issues into 
their programmes. 
Bilateral donors could further 
integrate and reinforce the environmental components 
of their assistance programmes and develop co-
financing arrangements with multilateral institutions 
while ensuring that this does not impose inappropriate 
environmental conditions; 
ii) 
parallel to this track the possibility of new mechanisms 
and facilities was considered. Some developing and 
industrialized countries suggested that new mechanisms 
directly related to a future climate convention and 
protocols, such as a new international fund, were 
required. It was added that such new instruments 
could be located within the World Bank (with new 
rules) or elsewhere. It was also noted that the Global 
Environmental Facility proposed by the World Bank in 
collaboration with U N E P and U N D P was welcomed by 
industrialized and developing countries at the Worid 
Bank Development Committee meeting in May 1990. 
7.4.7 
It was noted that the issue of generating financial 
resources was distinct from that of allocating those resources. 
7.4.8 
Areas identified for future work include studies, 
with donor assistance, for developing countries on their 
current and projected net emissions levels and assistance and 
141 

Formulation of Response Strategies 
cooperation needs for limiting such emissions. 
Further 
consideration is also needed of the important role which the 
private sector might play, through technology transfer, foreign 
direct investment and other means to assist and cooperate with 
developing countries to respond to climate change. 
7.5 
Legal and institutional mechanisms 
7.5.1 
A number of institutions and intemational legal 
mechanisms exist which have a bearing on the climate change 
issue, in particular those dealing with the environment, science 
and technology, energy, natural resources, and financial 
assistance. 
One of these existing international legal 
mechanisms, the Vienna Convention on the Protection of the 
Ozone Layer and its associated Montreal Protocol on 
Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, deals specifically 
with reducing emissions of important greenhouse gases which 
also deplete the ozone layer. However, there is a general 
view that, while existing legal instruments and institutions 
related to climate change should be fully utilized and further 
strengthened, they are insufficient alone to meet the challenge. 
7.5.2 
A consensus emerged at the 44th session of the U N 
General Assembly on the need to prepare, as a matter of 
urgency, a framework convention on climate change, laying 
down, as a minimum, general principles and obligations. It 
should, in the view of R S W G , be framed in such a way as 
to gain the adherence of the largest possible number and most 
suitably balanced range of countries while permitting timely 
action to be taken. It may contain provision for separate 
annexes/protocol(s) to deal with specific obligations. As part 
of the commitment of the parties to action on greenhouse gas 
emissions and adverse effects of climate change, the 
convention should also address the particular financial and 
other needs of the developing countries (notably tho.se most 
vulnerable to climate change agriculturally or otherwise), the 
question of access to and transfer of technology, the need for 
research and monitoring, and institutional requirements. 
7.5.3 
Decisions will have to be taken on a number of key 
issues. The.se include: 
the political imperative of striking the correct balances 
(a) between the arguments for a far-reaching, action-
oriented convention and the need for urgent adoption of 
a convention so as to begin tackling the problem of 
climate change; and (b) among the risks of inaction, the 
costs of action and current levels of scientific uncertainty; 
the extent to which specific obligations, particularly on 
the control of emissions of greenhouse gases, should 
be included in the convention itself, possibly as 
annexes, or be the subject of a separate protocol(s); 
the timing of negotiation of protocol(s) in relation to the 
negotiations on the convention; 
the introduction as appropriate of sound scientific 
bases for establishing emission targets (such as total 
emission levels, per capita emissions, emissions per 
G N P , emissions per energy use, climatic conditions, 
past performance, geographic characteristics, fossil 
fuel resource base, carbon intensity per unit of energy, 
energy intensity per G N P , socio-economic costs and 
benefits or other equitable considerations); 
the extent to which specific goals with respect to global 
levels of emissions or atmospheric concentrations of 
greenhouse gases should be addressed; 
whether obligations should be equitably differentiated 
according to countries' respective responsibilities for 
causing and combatting climate change and their level 
of development; 
the need for additional resources for developing 
countries and the manner in which this should be 
addressed, particularly in terms of the nature, size and 
conditions of the funding, even if detailed arrangements 
form the subject of a separate protocol; 
the basis on which the promotion of the development 
and transfer of technology and provision of technical 
assistance and co-operation to developing countries 
should take place, taking into account considerations 
such as terms of transfer (preferential or non-
preferential, commercial or non-commercial), assured 
access, intellectual property rights, the environmental 
soundness of such technology, and the financial 
implications; 
the nature of any new institutions to be created by the 
convention (such as a Conference of the Parties, an 
Executive Organ, as well as other bodies), together with 
their functions, composition and decision-making 
powers, e.g. whether or not they should exercise 
supervision 
and control over the 
obligations 
undertaken. 
7.5.4 
The international negotiation on a framework 
convention should start as quickly as possible after the 
completion of the IPCC interim report. The full and effective 
participation of developing countries in this process is 
essential. Many, essentially developing, countries stressed 
that the negotiation must be conducted in the forum, manner 
and with the timing to be decided by the U N General 
Assembly. This understanding also applies to any associated 
protocols. In the view of many countries and intemational and 
non-governmental organizations, the process should be 
conducted with a view of concluding it not later than the 1992 
U N Conference on Environment and Development. 
7.5.5 
The foregoing does not necessarily constitute an 
exclusive list of issues which will arise in the negotiations. 
However, a readiness to address these fundamental problems 
will be a prerequisite for ensuring the success of the 
negotiations and the support of a sufficiently wide and 
representative spread of nations. 
7.5.6 
The legal measures topic paper developed by the 
Working Group is given in Annex I.

ANNEX I 
LEGAL AND INSTITUTIONAL 
MECHANISMS: REPORT OF 
TOPIC COORDINATORS 
(Canada, Malta and the UK) 
Executive Summary 
1. The co-ordinators" report has as its primary objective the 
compilation of elements that might be included in a future 
framework Convention on Climate Change, and a discussion 
of the issues that are likely to arise in the context of 
developing those elements. 
2. There is a general view that while existing legal 
instruments and institutions with a bearing on climate should 
be fully utilized and further strengthened, they are 
insufficient alone to meet the challenge. A very broad 
intemational consensus has therefore emerged in the IPCC, 
confirmed notably at the 44th United Nations General 
Assembly, on the need for a framework Convention on 
Climate Change. 
Such a Convention should generally 
follow the format of the Vienna Convention for the 
Protection of the Ozone Layer, in laying down, as a 
minimum, general principles and obligations. It should 
further be framed in such a way as to gain the adherence of 
the largest possible number and most suitably balanced 
spread of countries while permitting timely action to be 
taken; 
it should contain provision for separate 
annexes/protocols to deal with specific obligations. As part 
of the commitment of the parties to action on greenhouse gas 
emissions and the adverse effects of global warming, the 
Convention would also address the particular financial needs 
of the developing countries, the question of the access to and 
transfer of technology, and institutional requirements. 
3. The paper points out a number of issues to be decided in 
the negotiation of a Convention. In general these are: 
the political imperative of striking the correct balances: 
on the one hand, between the arguments for a far-
reaching, action-oriented Convention and the need for 
urgent adoption of such a Convention so as to begin 
tackling the problem of climate change: and, on the 
other hand, between the cost of inaction and the lack 
of scientific certainty; 
the extent to which specific obligations, particularly on 
the control of emissions of carbon dioxide and other 
greenhouse 
gases, should be included in the 
Convention itself or be the subject of separate 
protocol(s): 
• 
the timing of negotiation of such protocol(s) in relation 
to the negotiations on the Convention. 
4. In particular, within the Convention the following specific 
issues will need to be addressed: 
a) 
Financial needs of developing countries: The need for 
additional resources for developing countries and the 
manner in which this should be addressed, particularly 
in terms of the nature, size and conditions of the 
funding, even if detailed arrangements form the subject 
of a separate protocol, will have to be considered by 
the negotiating parties. 
b) 
Development and transfer of technology: The basis on 
which the promotion of the development and transfer 
of technology and provision of technical assistance to 
developing countries should take place will need to be 
elaborated, taking into account considerations such as 
terms of transfer, assured access, intellectual property 
rights and the environmental soundness of such 
technology. 
c) 
Institutions: Views differ substantially on the role 
and powers of the institutions to be created by the 
Convention, particularly in exercising supervision and 
control over the obligations undertaken. 
5. The inclusion of any particular element in the paper does 
not imply consensus with respect to that element, or the 
agreement of any particular government to include that 
element in a Convention. 
6. The co-ordinators have not sought to make a value 
judgement in listing and summarizing in the attached paper 
the elements proposed for inclusion in a framework 
Convention: 
their text seeks merely to assist the future 
negotiators in their task. They note however that a readiness 
to address the foregoing fundamental problems in a realistic 
manner will be a prerequisite for ensuring the success of the 
negotiations and the support of a sufficiently wide and 
representative spread of nations. 
143 

Formulation of Response Strategies 
Possible elements for inclusion in a 
Framework Convention on Climate 
Change 
Preamble 
In keeping with common treaty practice including the format 
of the Vienna Convention, the Climate Change Convention 
would contain a preamble which might seek to address 
some or all of the following items: 
a description of the problem and reasons for action 
(need for timely and effective response without 
awaiting absolute scientific certainty): 
• 
reference to relevant intemational legal instruments 
(such as the V i e n n a Convention and Montreal 
Protocol) and declarations (such as U N G A Resolution 
43/53 and Principle 21 of the Stockholm Declaration); 
recognition that climate change is a common concem 
of mankind, affects humanity as a whole and should be 
approached within a global framework, without 
prejudice to the sovereignty of states over the airspace 
superadjacent to their territory as recognized under 
international law; 
recognition of the need for an environment of a quality 
that permits a life of dignity and well-being for present 
and future generations; 
• 
reference to the balance between the sovereign right of 
states to exploit natural resources and the concomitant 
duty to protect and conserve climate for the benefit of 
mankind, in a manner not to diminish either; 
endorsement and elaboration of the concept of 
sustainable development; 
• 
recognition of the need to improve scientific 
knowledge (e.g. through systematic observation) and 
to study the social and economic impacts of climate 
change, respecting national sovereignty; 
• 
recognition of the importance of the development and 
transfer of technology and of the circumstances and 
needs, particularly financial, of developing countries; 
need for regulatory, supportive and adjustment 
measures to take into account different levels of 
development and thus differing needs of countries; 
• 
recognition of the responsibility of all countries to 
make efforts at the national, regional and global levels 
to limit or reduce greenhouse gas emissions and 
prevent activities which could adversely affect climate, 
while bearing in mind that: 
most emissions affecting the atmosphere at present 
originate in industrialized countries where the scope 
for change is greatest; 
implementation may take place in different time 
frames for different categories of countries and may be 
qualified by the means at the disposal of individual 
countries and their scientific and technical capabilities; 
emissions from developing countries are growing and 
may need to grow in order to meet their development 
requirements and thus, over time, are likely to 
represent an increasingly significant percentage of 
global emissions; 
recognition of the need to develop strategies to absorb 
greenhouse gases, i e. protect and increase greenhouse 
gas sinks; to limit or reduce anthropogenic greenhouse 
gas emissions; and to adapt human activities to the 
impacts of climate change. 
Other key issues which will have to be addressed 
during the development of the preambular language 
include: 
should mankind's interest in a viable environment be 
characterized as a fundamental right? 
is there an entitlement not to be subjected, directly or 
indirectly, to the adverse effects of climate change? 
should there be a reference to the precautionary 
principle? 
in view of the inter-relationship among all greenhouse 
gases, their sources and sinks, should they be treated 
collectively? 
should countries be permitted to meet their aggregate 
global climate objectives through joint arrangements? 
should reference be made to weather modification 
agreements such as the E N M O D treaty as relevant 
legal instruments? 
is there a common interest of mankind in the 
development and application of technologies to protect 
and preserve climate? 
does the concept of sustainable development exclude 
or include the imposition of new conditionality in the 
provision of financial assistance to developing 
countries, and does it imply a link between the 
protection and preservation of the environment, 
including climate change, and economic development 
so that both are to be secured in a coherent and 
consistent manner? 
should the preamble address the particular problems of 
countries with an agricultural system vulnerable to 
144 

Formulation of Response Strategies 
climate change and with limited access to capital and 
technologies, recognizing the link with sustainable 
development? 
is there a minimum standard of living which is a 
prerequisite to adopting response strategies to address 
climate change? 
Defínitions 
As is the practice, definitions will need to be elaborated in 
a specific article on definitions. The terms which will need 
to be defined will depend on the рифозе of the Convention 
and thus the language used by the negotiating parties. 
General obligations 
F o l l o w i n g the format of such treaties as the Vienna 
Convention, an article would set out the general obligations 
agreed to by the parties to the Convention. Such obligations 
may relate to, for example: 
• 
the adoption of appropriate measures to protect against 
the adverse effects of climate change, to limit, reduce, 
adapt to and, as far as possible, prevent climate change 
in accordance with the means at the disposal of 
individual countries and their scientific and technical 
capabilities; and to avoid creating other environmental 
problems in taking such measures; 
the protection, stabilization and improvement of the 
composition of the atmosphere in order to conserve 
climate for the benefit of present and 
future 
generations; 
• 
taking steps having the effect of limiting climate change 
but which are already justified on other grounds; 
the use of climate for peaceful puфoses only, in a 
spirit of good neighbourliness; 
co-operation by means of research, 
systematic 
observation and information exchange in order to 
understand better and assess the effects of human 
activities on the climate and the potential adverse 
environmental and socio-economic impacts that could 
result from climate change, respecting national 
sovereignty; 
the encouragement of the development and transfer of 
relevant technologies, as well as the provision of 
technical and financial assistance, taking into account 
the particular needs of developing countries to enable 
them to fulfill their obligations; 
• 
co-operation in the formulation and harmonization of 
policies and strategies directed at limiting, reducing, 
adapting to and, as far as possible, preventing climate 
change; 
• 
co-operation in the adoption of appropnate legal or 
administrative measures to address climate change; 
provision for bilateral, multilateral and regional 
agreements or arrangements not incompatible with 
the Convention and any annex/protocol, including 
opportunities for groups of countries to fulfill the 
requirements on a regional or sub-regional basis; 
• 
co-operation 
with 
competent 
international 
organizations effectively to meet the objectives of the 
Convention; 
the encouragement 
of and co-operation in the 
promotion of public education and awareness of the 
environmental and socio-economic impacts of 
greenhouse gas emissions and of climate change; 
the strengthening or modificaron if necessary of 
existing legal and institutional instruments and 
arrangements relating to climate change; 
a provision on funding mechanisms. 
Other key issues which will have to be addressed in the 
process of elaborating this article include the following: 
• 
Should there be a provision setting any specific goals 
with respect to levels of emissions (global or national) 
or atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases 
while ensuring stable development of the world 
economy, particularly stabilization by industrialized 
countries, as a first step, and later reduction of CO2 
emissions and emissions of other greenhouse gases 
not controlled by the Montreal Protocol? 
Such 
provision would not exclude the application of more 
stringent national or regional emission goals than those 
which may be provided for in the Convention and/or 
any annex/protocol. 
In light of the preambular language, should there be a 
provision recognizing that implementation of 
obligations may take place in different time frames for 
different categories of country and/or may be qualified 
by the means at the disposal of individual countries 
and their scientific and technical capabilities? 
Should there be a commitment to 
formulate 
appropriate measures such as annexes, protocols or 
other legal instruments and, if so, should such 
formulation be on a sound scientific basis or on the 
basis of the best available scientific knowledge? 
• 
In addressing the transfer of technology particularly to 
developing countries, what should be the terms of 
such transfers (i e. commercial vs. non-commercial, 
preferential vs. non-preferential, the relationship 
between transfers and the protection of intellectual 
property rights)? 
145 

Formulation of Response Strategies 
Should funding mechanisms be limited to making full 
use of existing mechanisms or also entail new and 
additional resources and mechanisms? 
• 
Should provision be made for environmental impact 
assessments of planned activities that are likely to 
cause significant climate change as well as for prior 
notice of such activities? 
What should be the basis of emission goals eg. total 
• emission levels, per capita emissions, emissions per 
G N P , emissions per energy use, climatic conditions, 
past performance, geographic characteristics, fossil 
fuel resource base, carbon intensity per unit of energy, 
energy intensity per G N P , socio-economic costs and 
benefits, or other equitable considerations? 
• 
Should the particular problem of sea-level rise be 
specifically addressed? 
Is there a link between nuclear stockpiles and climate 
change? 
Institutions 
It has been the general practice under international 
environmental agreements to establish various institutional 
mechanisms. The parties to a Climate Change Convention 
might, therefore, wish to make provision for a Conference 
of the Parties, an Executive Organ and a Secretariat. 
The Conference of the Parties may. among other things: 
keep under continuous review the implementation of the 
Convention and take appropriate decisions to this end; 
review current scientific information; and promote 
harmonization of policies and strategies directed at limiting, 
reducing, adapting to and, as far as possible, preventing 
climate change. 
Questions that will arise in developing provisions for 
appropriate institutional mechanisms include: 
• 
Should any of the Convention's institutions (e.g. the 
Conference of the Parties and/or the Executive Organ) 
have the ability to take decisions inter alia on response 
strategies or functions in respect of surveillance, 
verification and compliance that would be binding on 
all the parties and, if so, should such an institution 
represent all of the parties or be composed of a limited 
number of parties e.g. based on equitable geographic 
representation? 
What should be the role of the Secretariat? 
What should be the decision-making procedures, 
including voting requirements (e.g. consensus, 
majority)? 
• 
If a trust fund or other financial mechanism were 
established under the Convention, how should it be 
administered? 
Should scientific and/or other bodies be established on 
a permanent or ad hoc basis, to provide advice and 
make recommendations to the Conference of the 
Parties concerning research activities and measures 
to deal with climate change? 
Should the composition of the above bodies reflect 
equitable climatic or geographic representation? 
Should there be a provision for working groups, e.g. on 
scientific matters as well as on socio-economic 
impacts and response strategies? 
Is there a need for innovative approaches 
to 
institutional mechanisms in the light of the nature of 
the climate change issue? 
What should be the role of non-governmental 
organizations? 
Research, Systematic Observations and 
Analysis 
It would appear to follow general practice to include 
provision for co-operation in research and systematic 
monitoring. In terms of research, each party might be called 
upon to undertake, initiate, and/or co-operate in, directly or 
through intemational bodies, the conduct of research on and 
analysis of: 
physical and chemical processes that may affect 
climate; 
substances, practices, processes and activities that 
could modify the climate; 
techniques for monitoring and measuring greenhouse 
gas emission rates and their uptake by sinks; 
improved climate models, particulariy for regional 
climates; 
• 
environmental, social and economic effects that could 
result from modifications of climate; 
altemative substances, technologies and practices; 
environmental, social and economic effects of 
response strategies; 
human activities affecting climate; 
coastal areas with particular reference to sea-level rise; 
• 
water resources; and 
energy efficiency. 
146 

Formulation of Response Strategies 
The parties might also be called upon to co-operate in 
establishing and improving, directly or through competent 
intemational bodies, and taking fully into account national 
legislation and relevant on-going activities at the national, 
regional and intemational levels, joint or complementary 
programmes for systematic monitoring and analysis of 
climate, including a possible worldwide system; and co­
operate in ensuring the collection, validation and 
transmission of research, observational data and analysis 
through appropriate data centres. 
Other issues that will arise in developing this provision 
include: 
Should consideration be given to the establishment of 
panels of experts or of an independent scientific board 
responsible for the co-ordination of data collection 
from the above areas of research and analysis and for 
periodic assessment of the data? 
Should provision be made for on-site inspection? 
Should there be provision for open and non­
discriminatory access to meteorological data 
developed by all countries? 
Should a specific research fund be established? 
Information exchange and reporting 
Precedents would suggest the inclusion of a provision for the 
transmission of information through the Secretariat to the 
Conference of the Parties on measures adopted by them in 
implementation of the Convention and of protocols to which 
they are рапу. In an annex to the Vienna Convention, the 
types of information exchanged are specified and include 
scientific, technical, socio-economic, commercial and legal 
information. 
For the puфoses of elaborating this provision, issues having 
to be addressed by the negotiating parties include the 
following: 
Is there a need for the elaboration of a comprehensive 
intemational research programme in order to facilitate 
co-operation 
in the 
exchange 
of scientific, 
technological and other information on climate 
change? 
Should parties be obliged to report on measures they 
have adopted 
for the 
implementation 
of 
the 
Convention, with the possible inclusion of regular 
reporting on a comparable basis of their emissions of 
greenhouse gases? 
Should each party additionally be called upon to 
develop a national inventory of emissions, strategies 
and available technologies for addressing climate 
change? If so, the Convention might also call for the 
exchange of information on such inventories, strategies 
and technologies. 
Development and transfer of technology 
While the issue of technology has been addressed in the 
section on General Obligations, it might be considered 
desirable to include separate provisions on technology 
transfer and technical co-operation. Such provisions could 
call upon the parties to promote the development and 
transfer of technology and technical co-operation, taking 
into account particulariy the needs of developing countries, 
to enable them to take measures to protect against the 
adverse effects of climate change, to limit, reduce and, as far 
as possible, prevent climate change, or to adapt to it. 
Another issue which will arise is: should special terms be 
attached to climate-related transfers of technology (such as 
a preferential and/or non-commercial basis and assured 
access to, and transfer of, environmentally sound 
technologies on favourable terms to developing countries), 
taking into consideration the protection of intellectual 
property rights? 
Settlement of disputes 
It would be usual international practice to include a 
provision on the settlement of disputes that may arise 
concerning the interpretation or application of the 
Convention and/or any annex/protocol. Provisions similar to 
those in the Vienna Convention for the Protection of the 
Ozone Layer might be employed, i.e. voluntary resort to 
arbitration or the Intemational Court of Justice (with a 
binding award) or, if neither of those options is elected, 
mandatory resort to conciliation (with a recommendatory 
award). 
Other provisions 
It would be the usual intemational practice to include clauses 
on the following topics: 
amendment of the Convention; 
status, adoption and amendment of annexes; 
adoption and entry into force of, and amendments to, 
protocols; 
signature; 
ratification; 
• 
accession; 
right to vote; 
relationship between the Convention and any 
protocol(s); 
147 

Formulation of Response Strategies 
entry into force; 
reservations; 
withdrawal; 
depositary; 
authentic texts. 
Annexes and protocols 
The negotiating parties may wish the Convention to provide 
for the possibility of annexes and/or protocols. Annexes 
might be concluded as integral parts of the Convention, 
while protocols might be concluded subsequently (as in the 
case of the Montreal Protocol to the Vienna Convention on 
Protection of the Ozone Layer). While it is recognized that 
the Convention is to be all-encompassing, the negotiating 
parties will have to decide whether greenhouse gases, their 
sources and sinks, are to be dealt with: individually, in 
groups or comprehensively; in annexes or protocols to the 
Convention. The following, among others, might also be 
considered as possible subjects for annexes or protocols to 
the Convention: 
agricultural practices; 
forest management; 
funding mechanisms; 
research and systematic observations; 
energy conservation and alternative sources of energy; 
• 
liability and compensation; 
intemational emissions trading; 
intemational taxation system; 
development and transfer of climate change-related 
technologies. 
• 
Issues that w i l l arise in connection with the 
development of annexes and protocols include: 
timing, i e. negotiating parties advocating a more 
action-oriented Convention may seek to include 
specific obligations in annexes as opposed to 
subsequent protocols and/or negotiate one or more 
protocols in parallel with the Convention negotiations; 
sequence, i e. if there is to be a series of protocols, in 
what order should they be taken up?
