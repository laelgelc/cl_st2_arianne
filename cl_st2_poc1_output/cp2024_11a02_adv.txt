The Conference of the Parties, 
Recalling the UNFCCC financial procedures,1 
Also recalling decision 19/CP.28, 
Having considered the information in the documents prepared by the secretariat on 
administrative, financial and institutional matters,2 
1. 
Encourages the secretariat to refer to activities as mandated in the respective decisions 
within the relevant documents on administrative, financial and institutional matters, as 
appropriate; 
2. 
Expresses appreciation to Parties that made contributions to the core budget in a 
timely manner; 
3. 
Strongly urges Parties that have not made contributions in full to the core budget for 
the current and/or previous bienniums to do so without further delay and expresses concern 
regarding the high level of outstanding contributions to the core budget for the current and 
previous bienniums, which has resulted in difficulties with both cash flow and the effective 
implementation of activities; 
4. 
Also expresses concern about activities and events, such as the regional climate 
weeks, and implementation of tools, such as the virtual conference platform, that facilitate 
inclusive participation being cancelled due to the unpredictability in contributions to the trust 
fund for supplementary activities, while some elements of the secretariat work programme 
were substantially increased; 
5. 
Reiterates that Parties will seek to approve future core budgets that include all 
category 1 (essential) and 2 (long-term, recurring) activities that have been mandated by the 
Conference of the Parties and the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the 
Parties to the Paris Agreement;3 
6. 
Also reiterates that reducing earmarking and establishing longer and more flexible 
utilization periods would increase flexibility in using contributions to the Trust Fund for 
Supplementary Activities, which would enable the secretariat to allocate funding to the 
activities most in need of resources,4 and invites those making contributions to the Trust Fund 
for Supplementary Activities to take this into account; 
7. 
Expresses appreciation for the contributions to the trust fund for participation in the 
UNFCCC process and the trust fund for supplementary activities received from Parties, 
including the contributions that allow for greater flexibility in allocation; 
8. 
Urges Parties to further contribute to the trust fund for participation in the UNFCCC 
process in order to ensure the widest possible participation in the process in 2024–2025, and 
to the trust fund for supplementary activities to ensure a high level of implementation of the 
secretariat work programme;  
9. 
Reiterates appreciation to the Government of Germany for its annual voluntary 
contribution to the core budget of EUR 766,938 and its special contribution of 
EUR 1,789,522 as Host Government of the secretariat; 
10. 
Requests the Executive Secretary to continue taking measures to recover Parties’ 
outstanding contributions to the core budget;

and 
FCCC/SBI/2019/INF.12 
and 
FCCC/SBI/2020/INF.3 for consideration by the Subsidiary Body for Implementation at its

13. 
Requests the secretariat to prepare an information document after each session of the 
Conference of the Parties that presents additional activities mandated at that session and their 
respective cost implications for the information of Parties; 
14. 
Notes with concern that the documents on administrative, financial and institutional 
matters prepared for the sixtieth session of the Subsidiary Body for Implementation were not 
made available before the start of the session and requests the secretariat to issue documents 
in a timely manner, at least four weeks before the opening of each session; 
15. 
Expresses concern regarding the high number of recommendations made by the 
United Nations Board of Auditors that remain unimplemented and urges the Executive 
Secretary to implement the standing recommendations of the auditors as soon as possible, 
with at least 50 per cent implemented before the opening of the sixty-first session of the 
Subsidiary Body for Implementation, and to continue providing information to Parties on the 
status of implementation of all recommendations; 
16. 
Encourages the secretariat to enhance clarity on the nature of activities, whether 
mandated or not, in documents on the programme budget for the biennium 2026–2027 and 
requests the secretariat to consider the challenges it faces in implementing mandated 
activities in the programme budget for 2024–2025 when preparing the programme budget for 
2026–2027; 
17. 
Urges the secretariat to prioritize the delivery of mandated activities and outputs and 
to ensure the inclusive participation of delegates from developing country Parties in sessions 
of the governing and subsidiary bodies as well as in mandated events and meetings of 
UNFCCC constituted bodies, and to provide information to Parties on its efforts to do so.
