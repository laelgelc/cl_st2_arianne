Nasrullah, the chairperson of the Forest Fire Community in Tanjung Taruna Village, Central Kalimantan, Indonesia, recalls the forest fires of 2015 which led to evacuations. Every dry season since, there have been ongoing efforts to prevent and extinguish fires.

This year, the fires have escalated since July, resulting in a state of emergency being declared in six provinces. Government responses, including water bombs, have proven insufficient to handle the crisis. The Greenpeace Indonesia team, alongside local people, has been working tirelessly on the ground. Despite these efforts, hopes have faded as the smoke has severely worsened air quality. The Air Quality Index (AQI) has surpassed 300 and, in some cases, has reached 2000, with the effects being felt in neighboring countries.

Nasrullah urges the government to enforce laws against the perpetrators responsible for the fires. He also calls for the implementation of strong peat protection policies to bring an end to these recurring disasters.
