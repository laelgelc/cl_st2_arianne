On January 22, 2021, the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW) entered into force, making nuclear weapons illegal under international law, similar to chemical and biological weapons.

The treaty was adopted by 122 states in 2017 and reached its 50th ratification in October 2020. It prohibits the production, possession, use, transfer, and financing of nuclear weapons. Greenpeace celebrates this milestone, which comes in our 50th anniversary year, and we honor the role of ICAN in this achievement.

Although nuclear-armed states oppose the treaty, they face growing criticism and pressure. The priorities moving forward are to universalize the treaty by securing more ratifications, monitor its implementation, and mobilize public support. Public approval rates for the treaty are already high in countries like Finland and Belgium.
