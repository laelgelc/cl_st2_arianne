Every minute, the equivalent of a truckload of single-use plastic enters our oceans, causing severe impacts on marine life, our drinking water, and our food chains.

Major brands like Coca-Cola and Unilever have inadequate plans to tackle this crisis. Their strategies focus on recycling, but over 90% of plastic is never recycled. These plans fail to address the core problem: reducing plastic production.

However, community-led efforts are making a difference. From plastic bans in Mexico and Scotland to discounts for reusable cups in Greece, people are taking action.

You can be part of the solution. Join the Plastic-Free Future Facebook group to connect with others. You can conduct a brand audit in your community to identify the top polluters. When you find polluting plastic, post a photo with the hashtag #IsThisYours? to hold companies accountable. For those looking to start local campaigns, the Million Acts of Blue toolkit provides valuable resources.
