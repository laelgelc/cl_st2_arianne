Aldi, one of the top ten global retailers, has joined Greenpeace's Detox movement. The company, which is expanding across Germany, Europe, the US, and Australia, has committed to eliminating hazardous chemicals from all its textile products by January 1, 2020.

This move reflects a growing momentum for cleaner production within the discount sector. Aldi joins other companies like Marks & Spencer and Coop, who are proving that sustainable, profitable, and toxic-free business models are feasible. Greenpeace is urging retailers to adopt new business models that are built on responsible resource management and product redesign, starting with a commitment to toxic-free manufacturing.

Aldi's acknowledgement of its lifecycle responsibility for its products marks a victory for the four-year Detox campaign.
