Jennifer Morgan, the Executive Director for Greenpeace International, travelled to Svalbard to see the rapid changes in the Arctic driven by climate change, such as melting ice and rising temperatures.

She points to industrial fishing as a source of pollution on the shores, where trash is primarily from fisheries. This waste harms wildlife including reindeer, polar bears, and seabirds, which suffer from entanglement and ingestion.

A beach clean-up was conducted as part of the ‘Protect What You Love’ campaign, which also served to raise awareness about destructive bottom trawling. Jennifer Morgan also noted a voluntary industry agreement that was brokered by Greenpeace. This agreement is aimed at stopping the expansion of cod fishing into untouched areas of the northern Barents Sea. Despite this agreement, she is urging Norway to create legally binding marine protections.
