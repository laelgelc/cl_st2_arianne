Farzana Faruk Jhumu, a 22-year-old climate activist with Fridays for Future MAPA and FFF Bangladesh, criticizes global leaders for their actions at COP26. She states they failed to address the climate crisis and continued to support fossil fuels. At the same time, activists from the Global South overcame significant travel barriers to attend the conference and demand justice.

Jhumu is frustrated by the minimal progress made on key issues, including climate debt and the concept of loss and damage. She highlights the role that youth advocacy plays in challenging oppression. In response to the lack of progress, she promotes the March 25 global climate strike, which uses the hashtag #PeopleNotProfit to emphasize the need to prioritize people over corporate greed.

Her own journey into activism was inspired by experiencing Cyclone Sidr and through her work in her community. She sailed to COP on Greenpeace’s Rainbow Warrior. Jhumu also addresses the reality of activist burnout, noting the importance of community support in dealing with it.
