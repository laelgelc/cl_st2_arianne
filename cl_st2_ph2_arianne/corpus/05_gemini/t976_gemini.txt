The Congo Basin, the world's second-largest tropical rainforest, is facing ongoing deforestation and degradation. These actions release carbon emissions and threaten climate stability.

While some new research suggests that deforestation rates may be slowing, other evidence indicates that threats to the forest are increasing. There are predictions that the Democratic Republic of Congo is set to lose 2.435 million hectares of intact primary forests over the next decade due to agriculture and logging. Forest degradation accelerates this loss, and these intact landscapes are vital carbon sinks.

Greenpeace has noted rising degradation and threats from oil palm plantations. We are calling for a halt to illegal logging, the protection of these forests, and the promotion of responsible community use.
