For Africa's environmental movement to succeed, it must be linked to decolonization. The colonial-era model of extracting raw materials continues today, a system that benefits foreign elites while causing harm to local ecosystems, economies, and communities.

We see this pattern in Shell's pollution in Nigeria and in the deforestation of the Democratic Republic of Congo, which occurs alongside widespread poverty. This approach is not a relic of the past; it is being actively pursued through ongoing multinational projects. These include oil drilling in Namibia, new pipelines in East Africa, and resource auctions in the DRC. Such projects only worsen the climate crisis at a time when the continent is already experiencing severe floods, droughts, and rising food prices.

A different path is necessary. African leaders must reject Western models and instead embrace traditional values that emphasize collaboration and respect for nature. The solution lies in building inward-focused economies that prioritize collective well-being, local innovation, and the value of informal activities.
