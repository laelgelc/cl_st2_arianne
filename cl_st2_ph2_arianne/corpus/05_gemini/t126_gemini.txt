Right now, governments are gathered at the United Nations to negotiate a new Global Ocean Treaty that will determine the future of our oceans. As a letter signed by numerous actors, activists, and experts emphasizes, the oceans play a vital role in sustaining life, biodiversity, and billions of people.

These vital ecosystems are facing serious threats, including industrial fishing and deep sea mining. In response, over 100 governments and scientists have voiced their support for protecting 30% of the world's oceans by 2030. A strong treaty is essential to achieve this goal by creating sanctuaries on the high seas, where protections are currently lacking.

After nearly two decades of talks, the need for action is urgent to avoid further crisis. A robust treaty is being demanded by over 5 million people who are calling for the protection our oceans desperately need.
