The claim of circularity in the fast fashion industry is a myth. In reality, overproduced clothing from the Global North is exported as waste to countries in the Global South, where it pollutes environments and causes harm to public health.

In Kenya, this problem is stark. The country imported 185,000 tonnes of used clothing in 2019 alone. Of this, an estimated 30-40% was unusable waste. This translates to between 150 and 200 tonnes of textile waste being dumped or burned every single day. The environmental damage is visible in locations such as the Dandora dumpsite and along the Nairobi River. Vendors who handle these imports confirm the issue, reporting that bales of secondhand clothing, known as Mitumba, frequently contain large amounts of poor-quality waste.

To address this crisis, brands must fundamentally change their business models. They must produce fewer clothes that are more durable and repairable. It is crucial that they end the practice of neocolonial dumping and instead support local manufacturing. While the EU's strategy is a helpful step, a global treaty is necessary to truly stop this exploitative cycle.
