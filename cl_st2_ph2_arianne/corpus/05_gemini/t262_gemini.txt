The climate crisis is driven by fossil fuels. Companies and politicians are sabotaging the necessary emission cuts with empty promises, lies, and false solutions, which harms the most vulnerable.

Similar to the tactics of Big Tobacco, Big Oil firms like Shell and BP use marketing to deny their responsibility, to greenwash, and to delay action. The consequences of this are deadly air pollution, the extinction of species, and extreme weather that displaces millions of people.

We are calling for a ban on fossil fuel propaganda. A European Citizens Initiative, which requires 1 million signatures, can achieve this. The goal is to prohibit advertisements and sponsorships for fossil fuels, for transport that relies on them, and for the companies involved. We are aiming for a #FossilFreeRevolution.
