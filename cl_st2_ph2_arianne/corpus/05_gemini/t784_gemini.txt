After 25 years of study, Dr. Susanne Lockhart, an Antarctic biologist aboard the Greenpeace ship Arctic Sunrise, is finally seeing cold-water corals and sponges in their natural habitat in the Antarctic Ocean. She expresses excitement about this experience.

These organisms create essential three-dimensional structures for the ecosystem. This habitat supports a variety of life, including fish, penguins, seals, and whales. During a submarine expedition, Dr. Lockhart is collecting photographic evidence and specimens. Some of these specimens are potential new species. This work is intended to identify Vulnerable Marine Ecosystems.

The data gathered will be submitted to the Commission for the Antarctic Ocean. It will be used to support proposals for the creation of the world's largest marine protected area. The goal of this protected area is to safeguard the region from expanding commercial fishing.
