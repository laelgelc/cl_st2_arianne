The 2020 Greenpeace film festival features 15 free documentaries, available in both English and French, that explore a range of environmental issues. In this festival, viewers act as the jury and can vote for the People's Choice Award.

The film selection addresses topics such as climate, food, agriculture, overconsumption, biodiversity, whistleblowers, and fossil energies. The documentaries delve into specific stories from around the globe, including the destruction of Borneo's forests, the rewilding of European landscapes, and the environmental impact of sea freight. Viewers can learn about efforts to save the Amazon, the challenges facing rural France, and the importance of ocean preservation. The films also examine interconnected planetary crises, Indigenous resistance to oil exploration in New Zealand, and the problem of plastic pollution on Basque beaches. Additional subjects covered include the relationship between eggs and African migration, the threats to endangered French forests, the plight of climate refugees from Kiribati, and ongoing climate fights in the U.S. The festival also highlights daily actions that can support biodiversity and the need for reforming industrial agriculture.
