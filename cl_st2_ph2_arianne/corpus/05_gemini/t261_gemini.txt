For 50 years, creative activism and art have been integrated into Greenpeace's mission. This began with the very first voyage, when peace and ecology symbols were painted on the sails of the Phyllis Cormack. The ship sailed to protest U.S. nuclear testing in Amchitka, an action which led to the cancellation of future tests.

Over the decades, artists from around the world have contributed to our work through music, designs, and protests. One such artist is Harald Naegeli from Switzerland, who became known for spraying stick figures across Zürich between 1977 and 1979. For his art, he faced arrest, exile, and jail.

After returning in 2020, Naegeli donated some of his drawings for an auction celebrating Greenpeace's 50th anniversary. His contribution inspired the global Hope through Action mural project. Taking place in 12 cities, the project aims to encourage public involvement in activism, whether through signing petitions, writing letters, or joining protests.
