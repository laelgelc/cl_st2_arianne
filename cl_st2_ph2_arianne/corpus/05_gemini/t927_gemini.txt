Greenpeace's German office has ranked supermarket chains based on their Detox commitments. Several have been labeled as "Detox Losers" for not committing to eliminate harmful chemicals from their textile supply chains by 2020. These include Rewe/Penny, Tchibo, Coop, Edeka/Netto, Norma, Metro/Real, Interspar, and Migros.

In contrast, Aldi and Lidl are considered "Detox Trendsetters." They are actively banning toxics, publishing discharge data, and have started recycling programs. Kaufland has now joined as the 33rd brand to make a commitment, promising to detox by 2020 and increase the amount of durable and recyclable clothing it offers.

The Trendsetters are focusing on the entire product lifecycle. Their efforts include implementing take-back programs and reusing fabric to reduce environmental impact. To help accelerate recycling, consumers are urged to return their clothes.
