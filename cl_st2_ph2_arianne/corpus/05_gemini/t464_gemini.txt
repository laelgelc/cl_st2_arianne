During the challenges of self-isolation in the COVID-19 pandemic, it is important to maintain physical and mental health while upholding our guiding values. We express our gratitude to essential workers, including nurses, doctors, and delivery drivers, for their bravery.

To stay engaged, we recommend a selection of environmental films and series. These include Leonardo DiCaprio's journey witnessing climate change, a film about the founding of Greenpeace, and a look at the oceanographic achievements of Sylvia Earle. There is also a documentary on minimalism and another sharing stories of Brazilians impacted by climate crises. For those interested in food systems, a film featuring Arnold Schwarzenegger debunks myths about meat consumption. Additionally, "Sexy Killer" exposes scandals in Indonesia's coal industry, and another documentary covers coral bleaching in Australia.

We invite you to share your favorite environmental films with us.
