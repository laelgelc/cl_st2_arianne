A Greenpeace China campaign, which started in 2008 amid food scandals, has led to significant developments in food safety. Recent tests on produce from 6 supermarkets in 8 cities, however, showed that 87% of samples had excessive pesticides. The highest levels were found on plastic-wrapped items.

Our campaign included a 2015 lawsuit against the retailer Lianhua. This action prompted Shanghai to establish a city-wide traceability system for fresh produce, which has become a national model for improving food safety. As part of this system, the city sources 50% of its produce locally. The campaign also resulted in Lianhua dropping 46 harmful pesticides.

At a national level, China’s 2015 policy set a goal of achieving zero increase in pesticide use by 2020. Sustainable organic farming is emerging as an alternative approach.
