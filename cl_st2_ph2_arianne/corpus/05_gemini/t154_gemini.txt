Fossil gas is a climate killer and a major source of Europe's greenhouse gas emissions, particularly through methane. The danger is clear, as shown by examples like a sunken rig leaking methane directly into our environment. Beyond its climate impact, gas is a fuel for Russia's war in Ukraine, with EU states continuing to pay billions for Russian imports in the absence of an embargo.

The harm from gas also extends into our homes, where it contributes to energy poverty. Gas appliances are health hazards, causing respiratory issues and accidents.

Despite this, the EU's RePowerEU plan is a flawed response. It focuses on substituting Russian gas with other fossil gas sources instead of eliminating it. In a contradictory move, there is a proposal to label gas as 'green' for investments.

True energy security requires a different path. We must phase out gas completely by 2035. This can be achieved by accelerating the switch to renewables, and investing in energy efficiency and insulation for our buildings.
