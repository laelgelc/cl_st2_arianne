Kenyan smallholder farmers are challenging unconstitutional laws that prohibit them from sharing, exchanging, or selling uncertified seeds. These laws, which favor multinational corporations within a broken global food system, carry punishments of up to two years in prison or a KES 1,000,000 fine for offenders.

In response, activists are taking action. Nasike leads Greenpeace Africa's Seed is Sovereign campaign, which works to protect seed sovereignty and supports the Kenyan court case. In Cameroon, Darcise Dolorès, an environmental law student and Greenpeace volunteer, is applying the South African rooibos case to safeguard Indigenous access to palm oil. Delwyn, a South African activist, coordinates Greenpeace volunteers and founded Food Connect Durban. This organization promotes local sustainable food and the saving of heirloom seeds, and its work is aligned with global movements.
