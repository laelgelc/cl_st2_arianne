For centuries, the Khanty people of Western Siberia have lived in harmony with nature. Now, oil industry expansion is seizing their land. This expansion causes animal deaths from spills and the loss of reindeer pastures.

The Sopochin family are Khanty reindeer herders who rely on their vast ancestral lands for grazing, hunting, fishing, and gathering. A subsidiary of Gazprom Neft plans to begin oil extraction on their land, threatening calving areas and water sources. The company is building roads without consultation.

Such conflicts are typical and inevitable. To prevent them, regulations in Russia should align with international norms that respect Indigenous rights.

A UN delegation is visiting from March 17-21. Sending letters can inform them of the situation.
