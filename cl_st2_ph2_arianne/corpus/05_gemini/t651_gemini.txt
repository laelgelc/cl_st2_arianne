At COP24 in Katowice, Poland, activists are highlighting the urgent need to end the use of coal and make a decisive shift to renewables in the face of worsening climate impacts.

An Indonesian protester shared how coal pollution directly affects the health of people and their communities. To challenge the denial of this reality, including from her own father, she has climbed structures as part of her activism. In Poland, the fight is local, as residents of Imielin resist a mine expansion that threatens their homes with collapse. Their cause is gaining global support, drawing parallels to the Hambach Forest protests.

A voice from Silesia, belonging to someone from a coal family, has called for a just transition. They noted that wind energy is already more affordable than coal, urging Poland to take a leadership role in climate action.
