Every two years, government delegates and NGOs gather for the International Whaling Commission (IWC) meeting, which is currently taking place in Brazil. The debate on whaling is polarized, with pro-whaling nations seeking to undermine the ban on commercial whaling. This is happening amid recent controversy surrounding Iceland's killing of hybrid blue whales.

There are competing visions for the future of the IWC. Japan has presented a 'Way Forward' proposal that seeks to legitimize commercial whaling. In contrast, Brazil has offered the 'Florianopolis Declaration', which aims to focus the IWC on conservation and the role of whales in the oceans. A proposal for a South Atlantic Whale Sanctuary is also a key issue, though it faces political resistance.

Greenpeace experts are present at the meeting. We are here to defend the commercial whaling ban, support the creation of the sanctuary, and advocate for an IWC that is oriented towards conservation.
