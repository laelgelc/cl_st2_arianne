In Cameroon, Herakles Farms' palm oil project has aimed to destroy 70,000 hectares of forest. This plan has moved forward despite the company lacking a valid land lease and facing local opposition.

The company is accused of intimidating its critics and violating judicial independence. It has also sought presidential intervention to enforce a burdensome New York arbitration clause for any employee grievances.

The project is now in a state of crisis. Operations have been halted and there has been minimal development. The company has left behind unpaid rents and taxes, unfulfilled promises, and has laid off workers. Amid this, new management and investors are persisting, even as the company faces lawsuits for unpaid wages and discrimination. Activist Nasako Besingi has been convicted for his involvement in peaceful protests against the project.

We must advocate for sustainable land use that respects both communities and the environment.
