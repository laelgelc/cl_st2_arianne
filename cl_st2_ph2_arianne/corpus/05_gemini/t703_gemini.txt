Emma Thompson has recounted a frightening encounter she had with an orangutan in a sanctuary in Kalimantan. This experience highlights how deforestation for palm oil plantations is destroying habitats. In just 16 years, 100,000 orangutans have been killed by being shot, starved, bulldozed, or burned in fires.

This destruction also endangers other species, including Sumatran tigers, rhinos, and elephants. Furthermore, it leads to human suffering through land conflicts and rights abuses.

Brands such as Unilever, Nestlé, and Mondelez had promised to implement no-deforestation policies by 2020. However, they continue to purchase "dirty" palm oil, placing their trust in the ineffective RSPO.

In response, Greenpeace has launched a campaign that includes a film narrated by Emma Thompson. The campaign urges these brands to reject suppliers who engage in deforestation in order to save the forests and the orangutans that live in them.
