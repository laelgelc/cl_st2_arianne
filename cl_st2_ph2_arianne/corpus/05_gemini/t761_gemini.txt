My name is Aakash Naik, and I’m a digital campaigner. When you check in on Facebook, it’s probably not to a vast, icy wilderness. But that’s exactly what people are doing as part of a global effort to highlight how precious the Weddell Sea is and the need for Antarctic protection.

This year, we have an opportunity to create the world's largest ocean sanctuary. This would safeguard penguins, whales, and seals from industrial fishing vessels, which are depleting krill near the animals' colonies and feeding areas.

By joining this mass check-in, you can help spark conversations and raise awareness. Here’s how you can join in: simply search for the Weddell Sea on Facebook, post a comment, and share the petition link at www.protecttheantarctic.org.
