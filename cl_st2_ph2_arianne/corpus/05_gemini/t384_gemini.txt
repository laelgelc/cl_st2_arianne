In the Chana district of southern Thailand, 18-year-old Khairiyah Rahmanyah, a fisherman's daughter, is leading protests against a proposed industrial zone. The project plans to convert 26.8 square kilometers of seaside into facilities for heavy industries, threatening the area's local marine resources and communities.

Her father's activism in the Thai Sea Watch Association has been an influence on her. To amplify the Save Chana movement, she has utilized social media tools like Facebook Live. As a result of her activities, she has experienced police intimidation, arrests, and surveillance.

Inspired by Greta Thunberg, Khairiyah continues her advocacy for environmental protection. Through persistent actions, she has succeeded in delaying public hearings. She has a dream of studying psychology to benefit her hometown.
