In Brazil's North and Northeast regions, Indigenous Peoples are forming Guardians of the Forest groups to monitor and protect their territories from invasions by land grabbers, loggers, and drug traffickers.

On November 1, this struggle turned deadly when 26-year-old Guardian Paulo Paulino Guajajara was murdered by armed loggers during an ambush on his land. Another Guardian, Laércio Souza Silva Guajajara, was also shot but survived. Paulino had been using technology to document the invasions and deforestation threatening his home.

This killing is a reflection of escalating threats under Bolsonaro's agenda and is part of a system of resource extraction that benefits multinational corporations. The violence is not an isolated incident. Between 2000 and 2018, 42 Guajajara were murdered. In the first nine months of 2019 alone, there were 160 invasions recorded across 153 Indigenous Lands.

In response, Indigenous leaders are in Europe to urge the international community to apply pressure on Brazil to uphold the rights and protections of its Indigenous Peoples.
