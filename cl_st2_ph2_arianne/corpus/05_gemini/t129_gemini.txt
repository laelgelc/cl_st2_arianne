The Russian war on Ukraine, COVID-19, and economic chaos are driving global food price inflation, hunger, and inequality. This crisis disproportionately affects vulnerable populations, who are already facing severe climate impacts.

While the UN FAO food price index has recently dropped, it remains 13% higher than last year. This global figure doesn't capture the full picture, as local prices have tripled in some regions. Grain shipments resuming from Ukraine offer some short-term relief, but they do not solve the underlying issue of a broken food system.

This system is dominated by big corporations that are profiting from speculation while destroying ecosystems and Indigenous lands. To counter this, we need political vigilance and transparency. We must support local farmers and agroecology, implement windfall taxes on corporate profiteers, and push for regulatory reforms. These changes are essential to promote food sovereignty and build a more sustainable system.
