Yu-Chi Huang, a Greenpeace East Asia veteran from Taiwan known as Kelly, has joined the Rainbow Warrior as its Onboard Digital Campaigner. She is part of the Global Protect the Oceans voyage in the Pacific. A diverse international crew is sailing the eco-friendly ship, which is powered by wind and travels at 7-10 knots.

The purpose of the voyage is to bear witness to ocean threats, including illegal fishing and deep-sea mining, while advocating for a strong UN Oceans Treaty. The journey is taking place despite pandemic challenges, with strict COVID protocols in place to ensure safe operations. These measures have included multiple PCR tests and quarantine for the crew. The ship will be at sea for nearly three months without stopping at any ports.
