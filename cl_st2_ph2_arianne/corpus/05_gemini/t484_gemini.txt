In 2016, a visit to Ecuador's Amazon revealed the devastating reality for Indigenous and farmer communities poisoned by Chevron's oil waste. This contamination has led to widespread cancer and birth defects, with pollution levels exceeding legal standards.

The affected communities fought back and won a $9.5 billion judgment against Chevron in the Ecuadorian courts, a decision that was upheld through the appeals process. However, Chevron has refused to pay.

Instead of complying with the court's ruling, the corporation launched retaliatory attacks against Steven Donziger, a lawyer representing the communities. In the United States, Chevron brought a RICO case against him, which was overseen by Judge Kaplan. During this case, Judge Kaplan accepted false testimony from a witness who had been paid by Chevron, while simultaneously barring the introduction of evidence related to the pollution in Ecuador. For a contempt charge, Donziger was subjected to home detention. This sequence of events highlights a clear case of corporate intimidation aimed at environmental advocates.
