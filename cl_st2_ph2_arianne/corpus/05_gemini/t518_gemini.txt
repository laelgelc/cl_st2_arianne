Indonesia's ongoing fires are causing smoky haze, creating health issues, and releasing massive amounts of CO2 emissions. This crisis is linked to palm oil production and deforestation.

According to Greenpeace campaigner Annisa Rahmawati, major companies including Unilever, Mondelez, Nestle, and P&G have ties to the destruction. These brands are connected to nearly 10,000 fire hotspots in 2019. Furthermore, between 2015 and 2018, 200,000 hectares of land were burned within the palm oil concessions of their suppliers. This has occurred despite the no-deforestation commitments these companies have made.

The palm oil trader Wilmar has also failed to fully implement its own No Deforestation, No Peat, No Exploitation (NDPE) policy. After initially suspending purchases from the problematic supplier GAMA/KPN, Wilmar has since resumed buying from them.

Greenpeace has withdrawn from collaborative monitoring efforts with the industry due to a lack of agreement on transparency. We urge companies to either enforce responsible sourcing across their supply chains or to stop using high-risk commodities altogether.
