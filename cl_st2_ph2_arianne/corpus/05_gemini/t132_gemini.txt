In an interview with Yewande Omotoso for South African Women’s Day, activist Pregs Govender discussed her work and influences. She spoke of her father’s impact on her understanding of storytelling and the importance of owning one's own narrative.

Govender noted that while Indigenous Peoples are protectors of the Earth, their contributions are often overlooked. She shared personal anecdotes about her mother, whose practice of recycling and ancestral knowledge she connected to the work of Wangari Maathai.

Govender offered a critique of the global system, which she described as racist, capitalist, and patriarchal, and exploited by billionaires. In response, she urged a form of resistance built on love and courage. This resistance, she explained, involves reclaiming our interconnectedness to counter the fragmentation created by power hierarchies.
