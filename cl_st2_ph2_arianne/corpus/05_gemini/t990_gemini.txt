The fictional breakup of Barbie and Ken was used to highlight Mattel's past use of products from Asia Pulp and Paper (APP). These products have been linked to the destruction of Indonesian rainforests and the loss of habitat for Sumatran tigers.

Greenpeace exposed APP's greenwashing and mobilized a campaign that resulted in over 500,000 emails being sent. This pressure led Mattel to adopt a new global policy for its supply chains. The policy commits the company to excluding deforestation, avoiding controversial sources, increasing its use of recycled paper, and boosting its use of Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certified wood.

Mattel's action adds to similar steps taken by companies like Nestlé and Unilever, which also urge APP to reform its practices. To continue investigating and working to halt deforestation, donations and public involvement are needed.
