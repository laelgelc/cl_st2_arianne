On World Fisheries Day, we highlight the innovative and sustainable practices of small-scale fishing. Fishers are adopting low-impact methods and connecting directly to consumers through a new market, one that values the stories behind products and their links to our planet.

This community is comprised of fishers, restaurateurs, retailers, NGOs, and more. To foster fair seafood, they are utilising technologies like peer-to-peer platforms, the Internet of Things, social media, and blockchain. Although these initiatives are a minor part of a high-volume industry, they offer a blueprint for a transition.

In this context, Greenpeace is launching its Roadmap to Fair Fisheries. The project will focus on Greece, Italy, and Spain while seeking to build ties on a global scale. We express our solidarity with all movements working towards alternative food systems and invite collaboration.
