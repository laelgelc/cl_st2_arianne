Two years after the Rana Plaza factory collapse in Dhaka, which killed over 1,000 people and injured more than 2,500, the fashion industry's toxic practices remain a critical issue.

There are signs of progress. Over 30 companies, including 18 major fashion brands representing 10% of the sector, have committed to Detox. This commitment to eliminate hazardous chemicals is already leading to cleaner factories in places like China.

We must now push for a Fashion Revolution. You can demand transparency from brands by taking part in social media actions, such as posting selfies with your clothing labels and using the hashtag #whomademyclothes.

The industry must fully compensate the victims and take responsibility for creating ethical supply chains.
