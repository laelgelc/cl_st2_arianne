Filmmaker Seemab Gul has documented Pakistan's 2022 floods, which were declared the worst in the country's history. The disaster affected 33 million people, destroying homes and infrastructure across the nation.

In regions like Balochistan, Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Sindh, Gul captured the stories of displaced residents. Her films also feature activists who blame industrialized nations for climate change and show how indigenous communities are bearing the costs of the disaster.

The films highlight the issue of climate injustice. They contrast the $200 billion in profits made by fossil fuel giants with the $16 billion required for Pakistan's reconstruction needs. The work urges Western nations and corporations to provide compensation to address these human-made disasters.
