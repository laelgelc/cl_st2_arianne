As policy-makers gather in Nairobi for UNEA 5.2 to address the plastic pollution crisis, there is an opportunity for substantial decisions to be made.

The crisis is having a direct impact on communities. Fishers are reporting declining fish stocks and are finding plastic in their nets and in the fish they catch, which threatens food security. They are urging for the enforcement of existing laws. In Kenya, despite existing plastic bans, pollution persists, and there is pressure to relax these restrictions.

The impacts are severe and widespread. In South African townships like Lenasia, plastic pollution exacerbates flooding and worsens living conditions. The problem also affects fishers in remote areas of the Congo.

To address this, a strong global plastics treaty is needed. Such a treaty must cover the full life cycle of plastic and include legally binding measures. It should focus on keeping oil and gas in the ground, promoting refill and reuse systems, improving waste management, and ensuring just transitions for affected communities.
