Seven years ago, Greenpeace launched the Detox My Fashion campaign with the goal of halting toxic chemical pollution from clothing production. Through public actions, we have secured commitments from 80 companies to eliminate hazardous chemicals by 2020. These companies, representing 15% of global clothing output, have their progress detailed in the Destination Zero report.

Brands including Zara, adidas, and Tesco are taking action by testing wastewater, substituting hazardous chemicals with safer alternatives, and working to improve worker conditions in countries like China, Mexico, and Indonesia. However, despite this progress, the growth of fast fashion continues to fuel problems of waste and microplastic pollution.

You can take action. Join us for MAKE SMTHNG Week from November 23rd to December 2nd to participate in tutorials, events, and community action. We can all contribute by choosing to buy less, and to repair, upcycle, and share clothes.
