To celebrate its 50th anniversary, Greenpeace hosted a global design contest that received over 200 entries from supporters all over the world. A panel of judges, which included Thai street artist Muebon and representatives from Brazil, Hong Kong, Indonesia, the Philippines, Russia, Norway, and Africa, selected the winners. The chosen designs were those that captured the organization's history and its vision for the future.

Leire Dominguez from Barcelona was announced as the winner. Her design features a peace dove that forms the number "50" from a Greenpeace ship. This image symbolizes the organization's evolution from its origins in anti-nuclear actions to its current focus on environmental justice.

Among those shortlisted was Russian artist Nickolay Drozdovskiy, who was inspired by the theme of planetary protection. More celebrations are planned, and there will be upcoming shout-outs for other shortlisted entries.
