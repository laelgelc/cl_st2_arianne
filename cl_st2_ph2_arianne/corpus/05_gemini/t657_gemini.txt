Climate change is a human rights issue. Its impacts, including ecosystem damage and serious health threats, lead to violations of the fundamental rights to life, food, and safety. These consequences disproportionately affect vulnerable groups, placing the concept of Climate Justice at the center of the fight.

To achieve this justice, people are using litigation to hold governments and corporations accountable. We see this in powerful examples from around the world. In one case, young Colombians successfully won a legal battle securing rights for the Amazon Basin. Elsewhere, a Philippine investigation is looking into the role of carbon majors. Meanwhile, a group of senior women in Switzerland has an ongoing suit against their government over its emissions.

This approach is gaining recognition. At COP 24, UN experts urged for rights-based action on climate change. To empower this movement, Greenpeace's People’s Guide was created to assist communities in building their own human rights-focused climate cases.
