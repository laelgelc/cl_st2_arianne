In a 2014 lecture at the Oxford Martin School, Kumi Naidoo identified civil disobedience as an essential tool for the weak to challenge the strong, particularly in the face of social justice and ecological crises. This approach follows in the footsteps of historical figures such as Gandhi, Mandela, Rosa Parks, and the Quakers.

Greenpeace applies this principle through non-violent direct action. The goal is to create compelling narratives that expose industrial destruction. For example, in 1975, activists confronted whaling fleets, and in 1978, they took action against the dumping of nuclear waste.

By taking such action, it is possible to shift the public discourse, reveal lies, and leverage moral truth. This is critical because power corrupts, and it leads to the denial of realities like climate change. In these situations, mere explanation is not enough; action is required.
