Despite the challenges presented by lockdowns and COVID-19 in 2020, Greenpeace activists around the world persisted in highlighting the ongoing climate crises.

In San Francisco, activists sailed to oppose oil industry bailouts, while in the UK, a BP rig was blocked. In Denmark, an oil rig was occupied as part of a call for a ban on fossil fuels. Protests also took place in the Philippines against government failures, and banners were displayed in the polluted city of Norilsk, Russia.

Activists adapted with creative tactics. Berlin saw light painting used for digital climate strikes, and in Seoul, the voices of youth were projected for all to see. The fight to protect our environment took to the skies in Hong Kong, where activists paraglided to protest reclamation, and in Jakarta, advocates stood up for Indonesian migrant fishers. Amidst these actions, there was a moment of celebration in Germany marking the demolition of a nuclear plant.
