At Essity's shareholder meeting in Stockholm, Greenpeace awarded CEO Magnus Groth the 'Golden Chainsaw Award' for the company's failure to protect old-growth forests.

Essity is Europe's largest tissue producer, making well-known brands like Tempo and Velvet. The company sources pulp from SCA, a supplier that destroys forests vital to the Sámi reindeer herders. SCA's destructive practices include planting invasive lodgepole pine.

Despite its own sustainability claims, Essity has not addressed the issue. A petition in 2017 gained nearly 250,000 signatures, and both the Swedish Sámi association (SSR) and Greenpeace have demanded that the company halt the destruction. In response, Essity has only delayed, held meetings, and requested more time, while ignoring these demands.
