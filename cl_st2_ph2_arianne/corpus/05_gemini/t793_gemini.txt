Jennifer Morgan has discussed the shocking level of ocean plastic pollution and examined Taiwan's efforts to address the crisis. A ban on free plastic bags in mainstream shops was introduced in 2002, but small businesses continue to use them. Alongside this, local innovations for plastic-free living are being developed. There is a call for government policy to be implemented to phase out single-use plastics by 2025.

The discussion also covers Taiwan's rising carbon emissions, which are driven by coal power. This increase is in conflict with Taiwan's pledge to achieve a 50% reduction in emissions by 2030. The government aims for an energy mix of 20% renewables, 30% coal, and 50% gas by 2025, while phasing out nuclear power. To ensure a just transition, Taiwan must accelerate its progress towards 100% renewables.
