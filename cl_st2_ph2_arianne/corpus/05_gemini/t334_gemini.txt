Coca-Cola's iconic 1971 "Hilltop" commercial is a nostalgic image that contrasts with the company's role in plastic pollution. The single-use plastics produced by Coca-Cola disproportionately harm low-income and communities of color, contributing to climate change, health issues, and social injustice.

In 2020, Coca-Cola was named the world's worst plastic polluter for the third year. The company is accused of relying on recycling myths while fueling a fossil fuel petrochemical expansion. This expansion risks high emissions and missing the 1.5°C climate goal.

Coca-Cola must end its ties to fossil fuels, stop its reliance on single-use plastics, and invest in refill and reuse systems.
