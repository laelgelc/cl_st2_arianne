The Arctic, home to threatened wildlife like polar bears and narwhals, plays a key role in the global climate. However, it is warming twice as fast as the rest of the world due to a process called Arctic amplification. As sea ice melts, the Earth's reflectivity, or albedo, is reduced, creating a positive feedback loop. This alters atmospheric circulations and jet streams, which affects weather patterns and leads to more extreme events like super-storms, droughts, and floods. These events result in human and economic losses. The Arctic currently lacks international protection. Greenpeace urges for the creation of ecosystem-based protected areas and is calling for public support to create an Arctic Sanctuary.
