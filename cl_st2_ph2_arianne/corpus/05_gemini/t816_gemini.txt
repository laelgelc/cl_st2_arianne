Greenpeace activists have taken to the streets to photograph people who support the protection of the Great Northern Forest. The goal is to safeguard its critical landscapes, which are vital for unique species and for global climate stability. We are urging a movement to pressure the company Essity to stop destroying this forest.

As part of this action, portraits of nearly 300 diverse supporters were brought to a threatened forest site in Sweden. This location, which is near a barren clearcut, is facing imminent logging. Quotes from participants emphasize the importance of saving old forests for their wisdom and roots, and for securing a future of biodiversity and climate stability.
