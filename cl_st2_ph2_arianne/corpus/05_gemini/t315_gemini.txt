Taiwan is facing its worst drought in 56 years. The drought has now lasted 18 months, a situation made worse by the fact that no typhoons made landfall last summer.

The impact on water reserves is severe. Reservoirs like Techi have seen a 73.3% drop in volume, while the Baoshan Second reservoir has fallen by 96.2% and the Zeng-wen reservoir by 81.1%. At the popular tourist destination of Sun Moon Lake, water levels have fallen to record lows, exposing large areas of mud and hurting local tourism and boat businesses. The consequences are being felt across society, with water shutoffs occurring in Taichung and mounting agricultural losses, which include a 20% decline in the tea harvest.

Climate change is projected to make these events more common. Forecasts show that droughts are set to increase, with spring rain predicted to be reduced by 13.2% by the middle of the century. By the end of the century, the number of typhoons could be halved.

Despite growth in solar and wind energy, over 80% of Taiwan's energy is still generated from fossil fuels. Greenpeace is urging the government to commit to a net zero timeline before 2050 and to implement carbon pricing to address the root causes of this crisis.
