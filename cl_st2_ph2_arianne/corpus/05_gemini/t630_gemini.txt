Greenpeace activists are in Patagonia, blocking trucks at an illegal dump. Here, companies including Shell and Total are discarding fracking waste directly onto the soil. This dump is located near residential areas and water supplies. The action follows an investigation that had already warned the companies about this practice.

Patagonia is a place of natural beauty and home to indigenous communities. This contrasts with the profit-driven views of oil executives.

This is not the first time we have stood up to Big Oil, and we have seen victories before. We have won against oil companies in the Amazon Reef, the Great Australian Bight, and New Zealand. We have also had victories in the Alaskan Arctic and against pipelines.

The IPCC report has warned of catastrophic climate risks. We must keep oil in the ground. It is time to join the global People Vs Oil movement.
