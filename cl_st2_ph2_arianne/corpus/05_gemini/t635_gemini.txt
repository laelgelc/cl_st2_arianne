In Brumadinho, Brazil, a tailings dam operated by Vale has collapsed, releasing 13 million cubic meters of toxic mining waste. The disaster has killed 110 people, with more than 230 still missing.

The Pataxó Hã-hã-hãe Indigenous community’s village of Naô Xohã has been severely impacted. The toxic waste has contaminated the Paraopeba River, a vital resource that the community can no longer use for fishing or bathing.

Community leaders Hayô and Werymerry have expressed their despair, referencing the similar Mariana disaster in 2015. They have voiced their opposition to mining on Indigenous lands. The community, which includes vulnerable members, is now dependent on donations.

Greenpeace is documenting the tragedy and demanding justice for the victims.
