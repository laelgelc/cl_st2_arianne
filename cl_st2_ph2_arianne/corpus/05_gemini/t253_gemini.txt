Across the world, individuals and organisations are building sustainable food systems while supporting Indigenous communities. A powerful example is Langit Collective, a Malaysian social enterprise founded by Melisa Lim and her friends. Their work focuses on promoting heirloom rice cultivated by the Lun Bawang community in Sarawak.

The collective’s model is direct and impactful. They buy rice directly at the farmers' doorsteps, paying them over twice the local market prices. This approach significantly improves the livelihoods of the farmers and encourages sustainable agricultural practices, such as hand-harvesting and a reduction in pesticide use. A crucial outcome of this partnership is the preservation of biodiversity, with over 300 heirloom rice varieties being protected.

Langit Collective's efforts extend beyond rice. They have also developed a low-cost Food Forest module specifically for resettled Indigenous families in West Malaysia. This initiative has successfully enabled 40 households to grow 24 different varieties of vegetables, enhancing their food security.

While the recent pandemic exposed deep vulnerabilities in our global food systems, it also served to highlight the remarkable resilience of traditional farming methods like those supported by the collective.
