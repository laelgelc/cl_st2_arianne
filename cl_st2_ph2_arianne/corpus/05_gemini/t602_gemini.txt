On May 1, the UK Parliament declared a climate emergency. This declaration was driven by the Extinction Rebellion protests that disrupted London and garnered widespread support.

The backdrop to these events includes scientific warnings about planetary biosphere shifts, runaway global heating, and significant biodiversity loss. Essays such as Catherine Ingram's "Facing Extinction" have raised the possibility of human extinction. Dr. William Rees has provided analysis on human behavioral traits that favor short-term gratification, leading to an overshoot of the Earth's capacity.

These issues are compounded by evolutionary biases and the myths of capitalist growth. In response, youth-led movements are now urging a societal overhaul as a means of survival. Their calls echo decades of ecological alerts that have, until now, been unheeded.
