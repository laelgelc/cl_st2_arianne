In Daraitan, Rizal, the Dumagat Remontado indigenous people harvest taro and purple yam from their hilltop farms, continuing the farming traditions passed down for their sustenance. They have faced significant hardships, stemming from the pandemic and their opposition to the Kaliwa Dam, which poses a threat to submerge their sacred lands and farms.

During Typhoon Vamco, they endured flooding, relying on ancestral visions to guide their evacuation. Despite their own struggles, they responded to calls for aid from others. The Dumagat Remontado donated vegetables to community pantries in Metro Manila, a grassroots movement established to share food during lockdowns. This act fostered solidarity and bayanihan, connecting the indigenous farmers with urban residents.
