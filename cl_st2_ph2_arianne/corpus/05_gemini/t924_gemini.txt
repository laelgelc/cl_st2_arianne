Nature lovers worldwide are urging outdoor brands Mammut and The North Face to eliminate hazardous PFCs from their gear. PFC-free alternatives for sustainability already exist. Greenpeace calls for these brands to detox now, which would align with their nature-loving values. You can join the call for non-polluting products through online action.

This demand is backed by recent protests that occurred in 13 countries.

In response, The North Face plans to phase out PFCs in its apparel by 2020, but this commitment does not include its other gear. Mammut claims it has limited PFC use and is phasing out long-chain types. However, tests revealed the presence of PFCs in all of its products that were tested. Long-chain PFCs were found in some of these items, and the company's progress on developing PFC-free items is slow.
