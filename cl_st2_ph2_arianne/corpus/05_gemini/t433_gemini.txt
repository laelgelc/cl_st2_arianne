During the COVID-19 lockdowns, the world experienced cleaner air. This was a direct result of reduced fossil fuel consumption, scaled-back factory operations, and a significant drop in transport emissions. In India, for instance, the Himalayas became visible from a distance for the first time in decades. Globally, there were measurable drops in pollutants like nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5).

However, as restrictions have eased, pollution levels are rebounding. This has been observed in places like China and the Philippines. To maintain the clean air benefits seen during the pandemic, a green recovery is necessary. Stimulus packages should avoid funding polluting industries and instead prioritize a shift to renewable energy sources.

Promoting green transport is a key part of this solution, including the development of more bike lanes and support for electric vehicles (EVs). Alongside these measures, emission regulations must be strengthened.

Individuals can also contribute by travelling less and continuing to work from home where possible. The connection between clean air, public health, the climate, and the economy is clear. Greenpeace is actively campaigning to ensure that clean air is a central component of post-pandemic recovery plans.
