Romania's transition from coal is a significant challenge, shaped by the memory of past failures. The transition in the 1990s caused widespread job losses and left deep social scars in regions like the Jiu Valley. To avoid repeating these mistakes, Greenpeace Romania has been advocating for a just transition to renewable energy sources.

Our proposal centres on empowering local communities through the creation of energy communities and prosumers. This vision sees former miners producing and consuming their own electricity with photovoltaic systems. Such a model is designed not only to provide clean energy but also to preserve local identity and combat energy poverty in these historically coal-dependent regions.

Authorities have now incorporated these ideas into the official Just Transition Plans. These plans are supported by funding from EU programs and include concrete measures such as subsidies for households to install solar panels and support for small-scale renewable projects for public buildings.

A clear timeline has been established through the Decarbonisation Law, which sets a 2032 coal phaseout date. To support this goal, plans are in place for workshops aimed at establishing the necessary legal frameworks for the transition.
