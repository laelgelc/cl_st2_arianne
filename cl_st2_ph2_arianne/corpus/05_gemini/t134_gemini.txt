My upbringing was in a South African township, a place that was diverse and religiously vibrant, yet also marked by cultural insularity and a struggle with constitutional diversity. In this context, we are witnessing a rise in hate crimes targeting the LGBTQIA+ community, which has prompted presidential action.

Simultaneously, the effects of climate change are becoming undeniable. We face water scarcity, climate-induced migration, and reduced productivity. Food insecurity and hunger now affect 40% of South Africans. These climate impacts, such as droughts, floods, and locusts—which the IPCC reports confirm—are being framed as signs of the "end times."

Religion is being used as a tool for manipulation, diverting blame for these crises. Instead of holding corporate greed accountable, blame is shifted onto marginalized groups. There is a need for grassroots sensitization to counter this narrative. We must call for equitable futures that prioritize people over profit.
