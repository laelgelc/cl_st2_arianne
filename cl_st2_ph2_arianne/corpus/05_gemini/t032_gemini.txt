At the 28th Session of the International Seabed Authority (ISA), governments failed to reach an agreement to stop deep sea mining. This has left the door open for this destructive industry to start this year, despite growing opposition.

A company called The Metals Company has triggered a "2-year rule" loophole, a move designed to pressure governments into allowing mining to begin this July. In response, Greenpeace has taken action against expeditions related to this plan.

Indigenous Pacific activists have been vocal, highlighting the risks that deep sea mining poses to vital ecosystems, food sources, and their communities. They have rejected it as a form of neo-colonial exploitation.

The movement against deep sea mining is global, with protests taking place in locations such as Kingston and Zurich. This opposition is happening at a time of increasing scientific warnings about the dangers of deep sea mining, and as a major corporate backer has withdrawn its support.

Governments now have a critical window of opportunity. They must act to prevent deep sea mining before the next ISA meeting in July.
