Effective beach cleanups require holding companies accountable for the single-use plastic pollution they create, rather than focusing solely on consumer behavior or waste management.

In September, Greenpeace Greece organized a brand audit on Charakas beach. Volunteers there collected three truckloads of plastic waste. From this, they were able to identify the brands on 3000 separate items. However, a revisit to the same beach in April revealed that a significant amount of plastic had already returned. This highlights the critical need to reduce single-use plastics at the source by implementing refill and reuse systems.

While global cleanup efforts are praiseworthy, a systemic change is needed. The way to achieve this is by auditing the brands responsible for the pollution. The Break Free From Plastic toolkit offers the resources to conduct such audits and demand accountability.
