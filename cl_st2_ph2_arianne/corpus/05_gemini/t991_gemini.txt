Three tar sands oil pipelines—Keystone XL, Enbridge, and the Kinder-Morgan TMX—are acting as fuses to a massive carbon bomb that threatens a climate catastrophe.

Opposition to the Keystone XL pipeline has led to protests at the White House, where unions, indigenous leaders, and activists have gathered. They cite the risks of environmental devastation, oil spills, negative health impacts, and high greenhouse gas emissions as reasons for their resistance, which has resulted in arrests.

In Canada, Indigenous nations are rejecting the expansion of the Enbridge and Kinder-Morgan TMX pipelines. They have issued declarations against these projects, emphasizing the profound risks they pose to their lands, waters, and livelihoods.

Across these movements, there is a clear call to halt the construction of these pipelines. The goal is to prevent the expansion of tar sands extraction and stop the acceleration of global warming.
