In 2017, Wixárika leaders Vázquez and Agustín Torres were murdered in Mexico. They were fighting to reclaim their ancestral lands from ranchers and drug cartels in a struggle marked by government inaction.

This is not an isolated story. Around the world, Indigenous peoples face similar threats. In Brazil, the Guarani and Kaiowa people endure violence from loggers. In Ecuador, local tribes have taken legal action, suing the oil giant Chevron for contamination of their lands. These events point to a failure of globalization to benefit Indigenous communities.

Despite these immense pressures, Indigenous peoples are on the frontlines of environmental protection. In Argentina, the Wichi and Guarani peoples, in a successful campaign with Greenpeace, stood against deforestation for soy plantations. Their role in preserving biodiversity is crucial for the entire planet.

As a group of Indigenous leaders stated in 2015, "We are the ones who live in the forests, on the plains, in the mountains and along the coasts. We are the first to see the streams drying up, the glaciers melting, the coasts eroding and the sea levels rising."
