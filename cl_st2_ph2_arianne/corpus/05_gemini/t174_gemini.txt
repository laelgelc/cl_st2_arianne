As a multimedia editor, I often grapple with the frustration that comes from witnessing the ongoing human damage to our Earth. Despite this, I feel a constant drive to fight for the planet. My work provides a daily reinforcement for this fight; viewing images of nature's stunning beauty reminds me that our home is worth protecting.

For Earth Day, I have selected images of Mother Earth's creations from some of the world's most remote regions. These images serve as a powerful reminder that nature is the greatest force to preserve and care for.

In this ongoing struggle, I invite you to share what motivates your own perseverance. What keeps you in this fight? Please share in the comments.
