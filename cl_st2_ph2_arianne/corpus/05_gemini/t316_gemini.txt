Deep sea mining is a destructive industry that poses a significant threat to deep ocean ecosystems. Despite existing scientific evidence that clearly demonstrates the long-lasting damage caused by such activities, the push to exploit the seabed continues. The precautionary principle dictates that this new form of mining should be halted.

Unfortunately, the International Seabed Authority (ISA) is failing in its duty, prioritizing economic interests over the protection of our shared marine environment. This has opened the door for companies like DeepGreen and GSR to engage in greenwashing. Through tactics described as "minesplaining," they make false claims about the supposed climate benefits of their operations.

We must reject the false choice presented between mining the ocean and mining on land. The true solution is not to find new places to exploit, but to transition towards greater resource efficiency and a circular economy. To safeguard our oceans from this destructive exploitation, it is vital to support a strong Global Ocean Treaty.
