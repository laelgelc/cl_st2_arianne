Grassroots movements are the driving force behind social change. To explore this, a series of live online Roundtable discussions has been co-created with activists, scientists, and others. These discussions will delve into themes like diversity, solidarity, and intersectionality.

The panels will cover several key topics. One discussion will feature experts from MSF and others, focusing on the health impacts of the climate crisis in vulnerable regions. Another will address activism in the Amazon, discussing the threats activists face and their need for protection.

A further panel will be dedicated to the issue of activist burnout and will explore strategies for resilience. The series will also feature a discussion on intergenerational activism, emphasizing the importance of creating cross-generational alliances to advance environmental and social justice.

The initiative invites collaboration, and panelists will be quoted on these interconnected issues.
