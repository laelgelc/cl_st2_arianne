We are celebrating a powerful milestone: over one million people around the world have urged corporations to end their reliance on single-use plastics. This global movement is driven by local action, from community cleanups where collected waste is audited to hold companies accountable, to successful campaigns for local plastic bans.

Inspired by this momentum, we are introducing the "Million Acts of Blue" goal. An Act of Blue is defined as any action taken to prevent single-use plastic from being created. This initiative is rooted in the principles of planetary protection and corporate accountability.

To empower you to take part, we have created a toolkit filled with guides for community action. You can learn how to deliver presentations, conduct media outreach, and effectively target supermarkets to reduce their plastic use. The toolkit also provides resources for urging fast food establishments to eliminate throwaway items.
