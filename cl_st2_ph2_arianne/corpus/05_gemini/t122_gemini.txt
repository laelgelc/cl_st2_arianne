Awa Traore, a Greenpeace Africa campaigner from Senegal, traveled to New York to attend the UN negotiations at IGC5 for a new global oceans treaty. The hope was for an agreement to protect 30% of the world's oceans by 2030. When the negotiations were suspended without a resolution, she addressed the delegates.

Speaking on behalf of over five million supporters, she brought a powerful message from the frontlines of the ocean crisis. She highlighted that in her home country of Senegal, communities depend on fish for 70% of their animal protein. She urged delegates to protect the oceans for the vulnerable communities who depend on them.

While acknowledging that some progress had been made, she lamented that the talks collapsed despite the momentum. She reminded the delegates that these negotiations have been going on for 20 years. During this time, species have become endangered, marine heatwaves have intensified, and 70% of the world's sharks have been lost. Awa Traore is calling for talks to resume soon to finalize the treaty this year.
