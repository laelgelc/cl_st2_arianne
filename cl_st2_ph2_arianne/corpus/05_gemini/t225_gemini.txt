In northern Russia, underground peat fires, often called "zombie fires," are persisting and smouldering even under the snow. This poses significant risks for the 2022 fire season.

The situation follows the record-setting fires of 2021, which saw 18.8 million hectares burn across the country. The smoke from these fires was so extensive that it reached the North Pole. The threat continues today, with ongoing smouldering in the Urals region causing smoke in the city of Yekaterinburg.

These fires are described as a "climate bomb." By burning through ancient organic matter stored in the peatlands, they release high volumes of greenhouse gas emissions.

Greenpeace Russia, which has expertise in combating these types of fires, offered to assist the regional government with prevention and extinguishing efforts. The offer has been accepted.
