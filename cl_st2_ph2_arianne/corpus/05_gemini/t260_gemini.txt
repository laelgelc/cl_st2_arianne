As a senior forest campaigner at Greenpeace Brazil, I am on a week-long trip with a team to document the Amazon fires and deforestation enabled by Bolsonaro’s government. We started in Porto Velho, where a recent rain had offered a brief respite from the heavy smoke that typically obscures the sky and damages the air quality.

During our time here, we have interviewed health experts from Fiocruz, Agevisa, and a children’s hospital. They described the severe impacts the fires have on public health, noting that children and the elderly are particularly vulnerable. The pollution from the fires spreads far, carried by the wind.

For local residents, this is an annual ordeal. They endure the smoke, low humidity, and the presence of nearby fires, all of which threaten their livelihoods. This is the first in a series of reports on deforestation, logging, and land grabbing.
