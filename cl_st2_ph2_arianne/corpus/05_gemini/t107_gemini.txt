Across Europe, countries and cities are introducing affordable 'climate tickets' for public transport. These initiatives are designed to combat rising fuel prices, save energy, and reduce harmful emissions. The schemes have proven popular and are beneficial for households. To address funding concerns, governments can redirect fossil fuel subsidies or impose windfall taxes.

A Greenpeace report, which analysed 30 European ticketing systems, has revealed inconsistencies in how affordable and simple these tickets are. The report found particular issues with discounts aimed at vulnerable groups, such as disabled people, low-income households, the elderly, and refugees.

As of now, no ideal cross-border and fully inclusive climate ticket exists. However, successful schemes in Germany, Spain, Austria, and other nations have demonstrated that these tickets can lead to reduced car use and a decrease in emissions. In light of these successes, there are calls urging for an EU-wide implementation of climate tickets to create equitable and sustainable mobility for everyone.
