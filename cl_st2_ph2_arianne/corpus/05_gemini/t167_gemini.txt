The century-old rivalry between Coca-Cola and Pepsi is now playing out in the plastic pollution crisis. Both companies are top polluters, contributing to this crisis, which is linked to climate change, through their reliance on single-use plastics.

Coca-Cola has made a commitment to have 25% of its packaging be reusable or refillable by 2030. Pepsi, however, currently has 0% reusable or refillable packaging, though it has pledged to set a reuse goal by the end of 2022. To address the waste filling our oceans, reuse systems are essential, and this requires building infrastructure and collaboration.

With Pepsi's shareholder meeting approaching in May, we must pressure its CEO. We challenge Pepsi to surpass Coca-Cola's commitment and set a goal of at least 50% reusable or refillable packaging by 2030.
