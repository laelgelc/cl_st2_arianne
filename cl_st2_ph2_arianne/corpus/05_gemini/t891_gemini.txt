For over 30 years, Greenpeace captain Peter Willcox has confronted polluters, faced arrests, and endured dangers such as the French bombing of the Rainbow Warrior, which resulted in the death of a crewmate.

He compares our Earth to a boat with 7 billion people on board. On this vessel, we are drilling holes, causing the waters to rise around us. It is time to send out an S.O.S., which he says stands for "Save Our Selves."

Motivated by the future of his daughters, Willcox emphasizes that Greenpeace's work is a fight against the human suffering caused by environmental destruction. This includes evacuating the people of Rongelap from nuclear fallout and rising seas, and confronting the slavery used in the deforestation of the Amazon. The work has also involved dealing with stowaways in Liberia and helping families in the Philippines who were poisoned by waste left by the US military. This suffering is personified by a dying girl named Crizel.
