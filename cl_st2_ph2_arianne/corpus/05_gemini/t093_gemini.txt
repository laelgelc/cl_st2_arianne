Meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement is increasingly unlikely. To succeed, global emissions must be halved by the end of this decade.

A new scramble for fossil fuels in Africa, triggered by Russia's war in Ukraine, is creating a major obstacle. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, oil blocks that are being made available overlap with protected areas, including Virunga National Park, and with carbon-rich peatlands. This threatens biodiversity and human rights, and is happening without consultation with local communities.

Africa's oil has a high carbon intensity, which worsens climate injustice for vulnerable communities in the Global South already experiencing floods and droughts. The International Energy Agency (IEA) has stated that there should be no new investments in fossil fuels.

Insurers must end their support for these fossil fuel projects. They need to divest and ensure human rights are protected, as demonstrated by actions from companies like Munich Re. This is imperative for both planetary health and for business reasons.
