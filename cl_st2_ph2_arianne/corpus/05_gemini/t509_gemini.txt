Six months ago, I travelled with a group of journalists to visit the Geraizeiros community in Bahia, Brazil. Our time there was violently interrupted by the arrival of armed men. Posing as police officers, they brandished assault rifles and intimidated us, demanding entry without producing any warrants or identification. After two hours, they left, but not before threatening to return. Their actions have left the community in a state of fear.

This is not an isolated incident. It is a stark example of the ongoing violence that comes with the expansion of agribusiness in the region. A company known as Agronegócio Estrondo has deforested vast areas of land for soya farming, invading traditional territories in the process.

The connection to global markets is direct. The soya grown on this land is sold to powerful traders like Cargill and Bunge, who then supply it to fast food chains. What is happening in Bahia exposes the deep link between human rights abuses and environmental destruction. It is time to demand change.
