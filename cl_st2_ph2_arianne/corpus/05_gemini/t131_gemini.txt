The UN General Assembly's resolution, which recognizes a clean, healthy, and sustainable environment as a universal human right, is the result of over a decade of global activism and litigation. This development builds on foundational cases like the Urgenda case in the Netherlands and the Klimaseniorinnen case in Switzerland, as well as legal challenges against oil projects in Norway and the UK.

Currently, there are cases pending before the European Court of Human Rights involving Swiss seniors, Portuguese youth, and Norwegian applicants. The UN resolution empowers climate-vulnerable groups and strengthens ongoing lawsuits worldwide. Examples of such lawsuits include those against Shell in Africa and the East African Crude Oil Pipeline (EACOP). The resolution also supports wider efforts to hold polluters accountable through judicial bodies like the International Court of Justice.
