Governments recently met in Hobart, Australia, to negotiate a new Antarctic Ocean Sanctuary, but the talks failed. This failure was due to opposition from Russia, China, and Norway, with Russia and China using delaying tactics to block progress.

The sanctuary had the support of 22 of the 25 member countries of the Antarctic Ocean Commission (CCAMLR). However, the commission requires unanimous agreement for any new protection to be passed, which allows a minority of countries to halt progress.

As a result of this outcome, Antarctic wildlife remains vulnerable to the pressures of overfishing, pollution, and climate change. This highlights the need for broader systemic changes. We must push for a new UN global ocean treaty to protect at least one-third of the world's oceans.

With 2.7 million supporters behind this campaign, we will continue the fight.
