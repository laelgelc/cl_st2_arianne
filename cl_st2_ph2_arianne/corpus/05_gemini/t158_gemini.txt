The aviation industry is engaging in greenwashing, making misleading claims about its sustainability. Airlines are promoting false solutions like carbon offsetting, which fails to reduce emissions effectively, and sustainable aviation fuels (SAF). However, SAFs are scarce, often unsustainable, and are insufficient for the decarbonization of the sector.

The industry’s reliance on supposed efficiency improvements and the propagation of "net zero" myths serve only to delay the real action needed. This occurs while the sector continues to benefit from subsidies and tax exemptions.

To limit global warming to 1.5°C, the number of flights must decrease. In Europe, this means a reduction of 2% annually. To achieve this, there are calls to ban fossil fuel advertisements, end industry subsidies, and implement a tax on kerosene. Promoting alternatives such as rail is essential for a just transition.
