Young climate activists are challenging world leaders on their inaction. In Australia, students have staged school walkouts to protest government policies, including support for coal.

Jamie Margolin is the founder of Zero Hour and an organizer of the Youth Climate March. She has also sued the state of Washington over violations of climate rights. In Sweden, Greta Thunberg initiated school strikes, which have inspired global movements. She delivered a powerful speech at COP24.

Survivors of extreme weather are also leading the charge. Litia, a Pacific Islander who survived Cyclone Winston, advocates for an end to fossil fuels through the organization Pacific Island Represent. Marinel Ubaldo, a survivor of Typhoon Haiyan from the Philippines, testifies against major polluters and emphasizes corporate responsibility.
