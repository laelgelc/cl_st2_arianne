During the COVID-19 pandemic, discarded disposable face masks have become an environmental issue, appearing on coasts and beaches globally, including in Taiwan. It is estimated that Taiwan used 1.3 billion masks between February and May, creating 5,500 tonnes of waste. While masks from medical facilities are managed properly, those used by the general public exist in a grey area. These publicly used masks are considered unrecyclable due to the risk of contamination.

The environmental risks are significant. The masks contain polypropylene, which degrades and can harm ecosystems and marine life. In response, government efforts have included public education and fines for improper disposal. There is a call for the development of comprehensive guidelines for single-use personal protective equipment (PPE) to create a balance between public health needs and environmental sustainability. This issue is part of the ongoing advocacy for plastic reduction.
