Riding on Vancouver’s skytrain, an advertisement promoting family planning as a solution for the climate crisis serves as a stark reminder of our situation. It brings to the forefront the arguments made in Vaclav Smil’s book, "Growth," which posits that the pursuit of endless economic growth is in direct conflict with the biosphere's limits.

Our attempts at efficiency are often undermined by the rebound effect, a phenomenon where improvements in efficiency ironically lead to an increase in resource consumption. The fundamental issue at the heart of our interconnected crises, from climate change to biodiversity loss, is one of human scale.

To confront this, we must actively work to end growth. This requires a multi-faceted approach: drastically reducing waste, downsizing our lifestyles, and addressing population. The way to address population is through the empowerment of women by ensuring access to rights and contraception. It is time to move past the pervasive myths of "green growth." The only way forward is through systemic change to escape our current state of ecological overshoot.
