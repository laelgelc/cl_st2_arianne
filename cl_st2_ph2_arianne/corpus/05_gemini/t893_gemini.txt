With Repsol's departure from the Chukchi Sea, Shell now stands as the sole leaseholder in United States Arctic waters. The long-threatened Arctic oil boom never materialized, thanks to a combination of strict regulations, low oil prices, high operational costs, and the challenging reality of ice coverage.

The risks of drilling in this fragile environment are immense. Oil spills are considered inevitable, and cleaning them up in such extreme conditions is impossible. These dangers have fueled opposition from local communities who depend on the Arctic ecosystem. Furthermore, any new drilling in the region poses broader dangers to our global climate.

This is not a new story. Historical lease rushes in the 1980s, 1990s, and again in 2008 all ended in failure, wasting billions of dollars. Shell's own mishap in 2012 is a prime example of the operational failures that plague Arctic drilling attempts. It is time to take decisive action and put an end to all new offshore drilling leases in the US.
