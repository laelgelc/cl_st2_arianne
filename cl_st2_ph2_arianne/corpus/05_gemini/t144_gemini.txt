Greenpeace Brazil has launched a month-long expedition from Manaus to study Amazonian biodiversity in the Manicoré River region. This expedition supports the fight of local communities for the protection of their land. In the context of the disappearance and confirmed deaths of Bruno Araújo Pereira and Dom Phillips, the team is persisting with its work to honor their legacies. The expedition aims to promote a vision of a sustainable Amazon that respects rights, in opposition to government neglect and violence. During their work, ornithologists have documented "Chico’s tyrannulet," a bird named after activist Chico Mendes, in a new northern habitat. The expedition is a call for justice, resistance, and public support to safeguard the forest and its peoples.
