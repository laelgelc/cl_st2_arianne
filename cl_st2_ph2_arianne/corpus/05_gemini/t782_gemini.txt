Over the last two years, Greenpeace has faced two massive lawsuits from corporate bullies trying to silence our activism. Aided by Donald Trump's law firm, these Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation (SLAPPs) are designed to drain our resources and hinder efforts for a green future. Our allies have also been targeted.

Today, we filed a motion to dismiss one of these SLAPPs.

This action follows a major legal victory. Nearly two years ago, Resolute Forest Products filed a CAD$300 million lawsuit against Greenpeace defendants. They used RICO statutes, which are meant to target organized crime, not activists. As we fought the lawsuit, public support grew. Three months ago, a US judge dismissed the case entirely. The judge also ordered Resolute to reimburse Greenpeace's attorney fees under California's anti-SLAPP law.
