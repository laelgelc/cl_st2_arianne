The near 'day zero' in Cape Town was a warning, but for half a billion people worldwide, severe water scarcity is a daily reality. A key driver of this global water crisis is coal.

From mining and washing to the final burning, coal pollutes and depletes water. This process releases toxins into rivers and groundwater, a problem seen in places like Indonesia, India, China, and Australia. Coal-fired power plants are also incredibly thirsty, consuming vast volumes of water and diverting this critical resource away from essential needs.

Beyond direct consumption and pollution, coal drives climate change, which intensifies droughts and makes water even more scarce. In contrast, wind and solar power offer a solution. Not only do they use minimal water, but they are also cheaper alternatives to this destructive fossil fuel.
