From November 6-18, 2022, the 27th UN Climate Summit, COP27, will be held in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. The summit focuses on advancing climate justice and limiting warming to 1.5°C.

There are several key priorities. A loss and damage finance facility must be established, which should be funded by polluting nations. There needs to be a rapid phase-out of fossil fuels, with no new projects and a commitment to just transitions. Low-income countries must be provided with $100 billion annually for their adaptation and decarbonization efforts. Additionally, nature protection must be integrated with the involvement of Indigenous peoples.

Recent IPCC reports highlight escalating crises. Amid growing activism, the global climate movement must push governments to take urgent action.
