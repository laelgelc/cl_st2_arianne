Greenpeace is urging world leaders to attend the CBD COP15 in Montreal to combat the biodiversity crisis and prevent mass extinctions. We are calling for ambitious protections, including a commitment to safeguard 30% of our lands and seas by 2030. These efforts must recognize Indigenous rights and center Indigenous Peoples in all decision-making and funding.

Implementation of these protections must happen across all nations. It is especially important that there is funding for those nations most impacted by colonialism. The biodiversity crisis is as severe as the climate crisis, yet its relative obscurity puts this summit at risk of failure without greater political participation from the highest levels of government. Biodiversity is vital for our health, our economies, and for climate solutions. This is an open invitation to world leaders to show up and act.
