I recently marched in Amsterdam's largest Pride Walk alongside Queers4Climate NL, Extinction Rebellion, and fellow Greenpeace campaigners. We were there to support LGBTQIA+ rights amid the growing climate crisis.

It is vital to remember that Pride is a protest, not a party. We marched because climate disasters disproportionately affect LGBTQIA+ communities. These communities face increased risks of homelessness and are targets of rising hate in the aftermath of climate-related events. In Fiji, for example, cyclones are being blamed on sodomy.

Greenpeace fights for a just and diverse society and actively opposes the greenwashing tactics of major polluters. We invite LGBTQIA+ climate activists to join us. The strength of our movement is found in its inclusivity.
