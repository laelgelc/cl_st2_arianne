Oil spills are an inevitable risk of our reliance on fossil fuels. The available data on these incidents is often incomplete, overlooking the majority of small spills that continuously pollute our environment. This immediate, physical threat from fossil fuels exists alongside the climate emergency, a crisis driven by CO2 emissions that scientists have been warning us about since 1965.

Recent disasters across the globe serve as a stark reminder of this reality. In Mauritius, the MV Wakashio spill caused devastating damage to coral reefs, severely affecting the nation's economy, the health of its people, and its food security. In Venezuela, oil washed ashore in Falcón state, impacting the rich biodiversity of the area and the communities that depend on it.

Off the coast of Yemen, the unattended FSO Safer tanker remains a ticking time bomb, threatening a potential catastrophe in the Red Sea. In Mexico, a leak from a Pemex pipeline contaminated agricultural fields and displaced families from their homes. Meanwhile, a massive spill from Nornickel in the Russian Arctic polluted major rivers. These events highlight the urgent need for a faster transition to renewable energy.
