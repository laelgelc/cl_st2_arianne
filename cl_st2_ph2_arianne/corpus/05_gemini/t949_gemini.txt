In 2014, members of the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) voted to protect the vast majority of Intact Forest Landscapes (IFLs) in certified areas, establishing a globally unique standard.

The Congo Basin, the world's second-largest rainforest, is located mostly in the Democratic Republic of Congo and remains largely intact. This region supports 60 million people and is home to wildlife including gorillas and bonobos. It also serves as a major carbon reservoir. However, the Congo Basin faces degradation from industrial logging, roads, mining, and hydrocarbons. These pressures worsen poverty, conflict, and habitat loss.

As the FSC expands into the region, caution is necessary due to poor governance and human rights issues. For this expansion to be a success, it must incorporate high protection standards, ensure community consent through Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC), and provide benefits for local people. A successful approach could transform logging models in the Congo Basin and beyond.
