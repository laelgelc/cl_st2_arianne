We must advocate for the trustworthy, ethical sourcing of our everyday goods, including food, wood, paper, and clothing. This means ensuring products are free from animal cruelty, slavery, pesticides, and toxic chemicals, and are created under good working conditions.

However, the current system is undermined by subsidies and the market power held by corporations. These companies rely on destructive practices such as the use of pesticides and fertilizers, the confinement of animals, and the sourcing of soy linked to deforestation.

The EU's free trade agreements, like the one with Mercosur, exacerbate these issues. Such deals harm local farmers, threaten Indigenous rights, and promote vast monocultures over the cultivation of diverse crops. This highlights a significant hypocrisy in global trade, where the benefits of "free trade" are touted while destructive practices are enabled by policies like the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). We also see contradictions in the form of Trump's tariffs and the EU's own protectionist measures.

It is up to us to challenge this system. We can take individual action by carefully checking our purchases and boycotting products connected to deforestation. We must also challenge our governments directly through letters, our votes, and petitions to debunk the prevailing myths about the benefits of free trade.
