It is time to vote in the European Parliament elections from 23-26 May to challenge authoritarian politicians and demand a fair society that protects our rights and our planet. While the EU has its imperfections, it has delivered achievements like improved air quality and bans on toxic chemicals. Collective action is necessary to address cross-border issues such as climate change.

There is a warning of xenophobic parties seeking to gain control. Their goal is to restrict our freedoms and accelerate climate catastrophe.

There are three key reasons to vote. Firstly, the EU has a critical role to play in averting climate chaos within the next decade. Secondly, the EU makes decisions that impact pollution and fundamental systems like farming. Thirdly, our rights, including the freedom of the press and the right to protest, are under threat in countries such as Hungary, Poland, and Spain.
