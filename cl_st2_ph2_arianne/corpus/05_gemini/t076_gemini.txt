In 2022, as the world faced ongoing challenges and a shift in normalcy, nature unleashed record heat waves across Europe, Africa, America, and China. These extreme temperatures resulted in wildfires, droughts, deaths, and the drying up of lakes and rivers. At the same time, Pakistan suffered its worst flooding, which submerged one-third of the country and had an impact on 33 million people.

We are in a Climate Emergency, and urgent, courageous action is needed to save the planet for future generations. It is through the collective will of activists and volunteers that governments can be pushed to take the necessary action. Images of these efforts inspire hope in the ongoing fight for people and the planet.
