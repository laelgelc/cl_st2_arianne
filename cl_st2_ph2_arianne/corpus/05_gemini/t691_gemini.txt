The 67th International Whaling Commission (IWC) meeting has concluded in Florianopolis, Brazil. The meeting took place amid ongoing polarization between countries. Greenpeace and other groups were present as observers.

A key outcome was the adoption of the Florianopolis Declaration, which affirms the important role of whales in their ecosystems and the IWC's primary focus on conservation. This comes as whales face rising threats, including climate change and pollution.

During the meeting, Japan put forward a proposal that would have undermined the 30-year ban on commercial whaling, but this was rejected.

However, a proposal to create a South Atlantic Whale Sanctuary did not pass. While it received support from a majority of countries, it failed to secure the required super-majority vote.

Ultimately, the IWC's role in conservation was reaffirmed, emphasizing the need to maintain momentum for the protection of our oceans.
