Authors, journalists, poets, and playwrights improve the planet by freely expressing ideas, as free speech is essential for positive change. In response to multimillion-dollar lawsuits by the Canadian company Resolute Forest Products, over 100 authors have pledged to defend free speech and those who are peacefully protecting forests. The company's lawsuits are aimed at silencing Greenpeace and Stand.earth's exposure of its controversial logging in the boreal forest. This post shares quotes from some of the authors who have made this pledge and includes links to more signatories. We thank our supporters for celebrating freedom of expression and advocacy.
