World Cities Day on October 31 highlights that over half of humanity lives in urban areas. By 2050, significant growth is projected in cities across Latin America, the Caribbean, Africa, and Asia. In light of this, cities must transform into hubs of climate action, resilience, and justice.

The concept of #UrbanJustice focuses on affected communities using collective efforts to reshape spaces, mindsets, and policies for climate justice. Examples of this in action include Mangala's cycling initiative in her city, which was created to combat air pollution, and José's street cleaning project in Bogota, which fosters inclusivity. In India, Kusum's #PowerThePedal movement champions sustainable mobility. In Istanbul, Dilruba is engaged in work for gender equality, while Mexico City's use of chinampas provides a solution for water access and flood prevention. #UrbanJustice embodies the connection between social and climate justice.
