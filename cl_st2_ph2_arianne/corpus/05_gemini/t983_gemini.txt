In response to demands from hundreds of thousands of people involved in Greenpeace's Detox campaign, Levi Strauss & Co. has made a commitment to go toxic-free. This decision follows a Greenpeace report and a documentary that highlighted pollution originating from clothing factories in Mexico and other locations.

Levi’s now joins 11 other brands, including Zara, in this commitment. As part of its pledge, Levi’s will require its major suppliers in China, Mexico, and throughout the Global South to disclose their pollution data by June 2013. The company will also seek out non-hazardous alternatives and adopt the precautionary principle.

The campaign continues to build pressure on other brands. We urge you to share the "Detox Fashion" video to encourage companies like Calvin Klein, GAP, and Victoria’s Secret to eliminate hazardous chemicals from their production and put an end to the pollution of our rivers.
