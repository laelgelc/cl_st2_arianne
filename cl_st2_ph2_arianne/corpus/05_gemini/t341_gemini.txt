Will McCallum, our head of oceans at Greenpeace UK, has witnessed the destructive reality of industrial fishing in the Indian Ocean. He has seen the bycatch of dolphins, rays, and sharks, and the struggles of fishing communities that are facing declining stocks.

While choices like veganism can aid planetary health by reducing overall fish consumption, it is not a full solution to the crisis our oceans face. This is because billions of people rely on the oceans for their food and their livelihoods.

That is why Greenpeace advocates for a Global Ocean Treaty. Such a treaty would protect 30% of the world's oceans by 2030 and ensure the rest is managed sustainably. We are actively working to combat destructive industrial fishing through several actions. These include challenging tuna companies, working to prevent bottom trawling, and supporting the rights of fishers. Our work emphasizes solidarity with vulnerable coastal communities.
