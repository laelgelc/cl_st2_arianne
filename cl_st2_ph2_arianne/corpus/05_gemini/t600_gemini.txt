Post-doctoral researcher Hillary Glandon has joined a Greenpeace expedition in the Fram Strait to study the ice conditions and ecosystems of the Arctic Ocean, from its ice to its marine mammals.

The team, which is led by Dr. Till Wagner, is conducting measurements along the 79°N latitude line. Every two degrees of longitude, they use a Rosette device to sample water at depths reaching up to 250 meters. These samples will provide information on temperature, salinity, nutrients, phytoplankton, trace metals, zooplankton, acidity, isotopes, and currents. In addition to water sampling, the researchers are measuring ice thickness and taking ice cores for salinity and biological analysis.

From her post on the ship's bridge, Glandon has been observing for mammals and birds but has not seen any. She described the environment as bright and surreal, noting challenges such as eye sunburn.
