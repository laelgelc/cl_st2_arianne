Greenpeace Argentina, in partnership with allied organizations, filed a class action lawsuit to challenge the government's approval of Equinor's seismic exploration in the Argentine Sea. The lawsuit cited the project's unconstitutionality and the risks it poses to marine life and coastal communities.

This legal action was a catalyst for the #Atlanticazo movement, which involved widespread protests. In a significant development, the Federal Court in Mar del Plata issued a precautionary measure that suspends the project indefinitely.

The court's decision underscored the necessity of transparency, citizen participation, and adherence to the Escazú Agreement. It also called for a proper environmental impact assessment that specifically addresses cumulative effects and applies the precautionary principle. The ruling highlights serious dangers associated with the project, including oil spills and harm to the ecosystem. This outcome marks a victory for public action in the face of ongoing climate concerns.
