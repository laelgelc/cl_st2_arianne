During a recent Greenpeace field trip to the Amazon, our team visited Porto Velho, Lábrea, and Humaitá. We witnessed the impacts of agribusiness expansion firsthand.

This expansion threatens agroextractivists, who are being forced off their lands. We saw evidence of land accumulation, invasions of Indigenous territories, and land being prepared for soy plantations. This preparation follows a destructive cycle that begins with timber removal and is followed by cattle ranching.

Worsening the situation, new infrastructure projects like bus lines, highways, and branches are expected to increase both deforestation and the flow of people into the region. This mirrors the devastating patterns of destruction that have already occurred in the Cerrado and Pará.

We heard sad reports of violence and saw burned areas. However, in the midst of this, we also had encounters with advocates for sustainable development, whose work offers hope. We must stand with the guardians of the Amazon. Join the movement to support them.
