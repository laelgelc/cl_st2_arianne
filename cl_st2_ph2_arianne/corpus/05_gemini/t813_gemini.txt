The Congo Basin is a vibrant forest, providing a home to endangered wildlife. For local Indigenous communities, this forest is a vital source of water, food, medicine, and spiritual sustenance.

Within this region, the world's largest peatland complex has been discovered, a crucial area for carbon storage and the mitigation of climate change. These peatlands are now threatened by logging and agribusiness, including palm oil plantations. Such activities lead to biodiversity loss and reduced resilience for the entire ecosystem.

Greenpeace invites you to participate in its protection. You can join in by dancing to the song "Dance for the Congo Basin" and sharing it with #DanceForCongo. You can also add your wishes to a traveling "Wish Tree" that will be brought to COP23. In 2017, there is an opportunity to join an expedition aboard the ship Esperanza to explore the peatlands.
