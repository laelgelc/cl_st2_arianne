On January 17, I joined the "We are fed up" march against agribusiness in Berlin. The large turnout was a clear sign of the widespread concern people have for food production and where their food comes from. I was surprised to see that Germany has a strong food movement, similar to the one in North America.

This movement is a response to the failures of our food system. These failures include the use of pesticides and genetically engineered seeds, as well as industrial animal farming. Our system is also plagued by pollution from fertilizers, weakened environmental and food protections through trade agreements like TTIP and CETA, and serious threats to bees.

However, there is hope. This hope comes from the growing number of people who are adopting organic and low-meat diets. It comes from those who are buying local, gardening, and joining food justice groups. I urge you to connect with your local farms and with the movements that are fighting for better food systems.
