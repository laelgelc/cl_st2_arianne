The Spanish Congress has approved the Climate Change and Energy Transition Law, but it lacks the ambition required to effectively address the climate emergency.

The law does incorporate some measures, including new rules for public procurement to ensure lower emissions, a recognition of diet's role in sustainability, and requirements for climate finance reporting. It also establishes a minimum percentage of the national budget to be dedicated to climate action. We acknowledge some positive aspects, such as the creation of low emission zones and plans for energy renovation.

However, the legislation is critically weak in key areas. It falls short on taxation reform and sets unambitious emissions targets, aiming for only a 23% reduction by 2030. Furthermore, it fails to establish a phase-out date for fossil fuels and does not include bans on fossil fuel advertising or on short-haul flights.

We view this law as a watered-down version of what is needed. While it contains some beneficial elements, we must urge for much stronger commitments to ensure a truly fair ecological transition.
