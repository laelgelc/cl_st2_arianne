In the face of the climate crisis, nuclear power is falsely promoted as a quick, safe, and efficient solution for decarbonizing our energy systems. The reality, however, is starkly different.

Nuclear power is an incredibly expensive solution, with costs ranging from $112 to $189 per MWh, making it far more costly than cheaper renewable energy sources. It is also anything but quick. With average construction times for a new plant stretching to 10 years, it fails to provide the rapid response we need to lower emissions now.

Furthermore, nuclear facilities are vulnerable to the very climate impacts they are meant to address, facing operational challenges from heatwaves and water stress. The process is not free from emissions either; significant amounts of CO2 are produced during the building of plants and the processing of uranium. This comes with the unresolved and dangerous legacy of unmanaged radioactive waste.

The financial burden falls heavily on taxpayers, who are saddled with billions in costs. Beyond the economic strain, nuclear power poses serious security risks. These plants are targets for terrorism and are vulnerable to natural disasters or war, as the situation in Ukraine has demonstrated.

Even new technologies like EPR and fusion, often touted as the future, are proving to be unviable solutions, suffering from extensive delays and running severely overbudget.

For the urgent emissions reductions required, we must invest in genuine solutions. Renewables offer faster, cheaper, and scalable alternatives that can be deployed now to effectively combat the climate crisis.
