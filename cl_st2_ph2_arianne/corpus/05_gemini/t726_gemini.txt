From June 11 to 17, World Meat Free Week encourages people across the globe to eat plant-based meals and participate in the movement for a healthier planet.

Intensive meat and dairy production is a significant driver of deforestation. Over a quarter of the Earth's land is utilized for grazing, and the industry's contribution to global warming is equivalent to that of all transport emissions. It is also the largest consumer and polluter of water.

Beyond the environmental impact, high intake of red meat is linked to health conditions such as cancer, heart disease, obesity, and diabetes. A global shift to plant-based diets could potentially prevent five million deaths by 2050.

Individuals can take part by eating more vegetables and hosting potlucks. Greenpeace provides a cookbook and a toolkit to support these efforts. This action is also being taken at a larger scale, with cities in countries like Mexico and Denmark promoting vegetarian options in public institutions.
