Cyclone Idai has devastated Mozambique, Malawi, and Zimbabwe. Millions of people have been affected by the disaster, which has caused rising deaths and widespread destruction. According to the UN, this could potentially be the region's worst-ever disaster.

This is happening in a context of increasing extreme weather. Zimbabwe has recently experienced drought, and the region previously faced Cyclone Eline in 2000. We are also witnessing the effects of climate change as Lake Chilwa dries up. In Chimanimani, the hardest-hit area in Zimbabwe, roads and homes have been destroyed, and lives have been lost.

Amid the devastation, people are taking action. The author, a member of the diaspora, mobilized aid through social media, which in turn inspired community relief efforts. The reality of climate change demands urgent action on the Paris Agreement, which must be integrated with development. People-powered movements are growing and demanding more from their leaders.

Aid organizations including Save the Children, Médecins Sans Frontières, and the Red Cross are responding. It is time to join the movement for climate justice.
