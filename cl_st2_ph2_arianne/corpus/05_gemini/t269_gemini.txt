The intertwined crises of climate change and plastic pollution are driven by fossil fuels and corporate practices. Exxon is expanding plastic production, and Coca-Cola continues to rely on single-use plastics, despite the fact that only 9% of all plastic ever produced has been recycled.

Contributors Marian Ledesma and Graham Forbes have discussed the impacts on communities, health, and economies in places like the Philippines and the US. There is an urgent need for systemic shifts away from recycling and toward reuse models. This includes calls for policies that ban single-use plastics, ensure corporate accountability, and establish a global plastics treaty. Companies like Coke, Pepsi, and Nestlé are being demanded to transition to reusables.
