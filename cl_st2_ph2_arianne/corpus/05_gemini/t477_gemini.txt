Nanticha Ocharoenchai reflects on how climate activism has changed for her. What once felt fun, with strikes and chants, has become stressful. The work now involves navigating policy complexities, managing volunteers, handling media duties, and dealing with the anxiety that comes from climate fears.

She sometimes wonders if other figures, like landscape architect Kotchakorn Voraakhom, feel hopeless in the face of it all. Yet, she observes that they persist despite the difficulties.

This perspective is influenced by her mother, who instilled in her a problem-solving mindset. This has taught her to transform challenges into opportunities. She now combines storytelling with advocacy, using writing, film, and photography as her tools. From the women in her life, she has learned how to recover from lows, to keep going with hope, and to credit herself for her own achievements.
