Devastating oil spills by Lukoil in Russia's Pechora river region are poisoning rivers, killing fish, and harming Indigenous communities. Local resident Galina Chuprova compares the company to an invading enemy, urging villagers to unite in defense of their home. Greenpeace volunteer Julia Lapshina has described witnessing toxic spills and questions oil producers' disregard for safety.

The Save Pechora Committee and Greenpeace demand reduced spills and higher standards from the oil industry. Together, they organized a 'Skis against oil' race to rally locals for the Break Free from Fossil Fuels movement. Committee members Dmitriy Kanev and Fyodor Terentiev shared motivations rooted in protecting nature and their traditional ways of life, emphasizing the power of collective action.
