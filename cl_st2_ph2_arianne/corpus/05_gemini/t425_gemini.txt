Elena Makurina, Head of Visual Solutions at Greenpeace Russia, reflects on the decline of LGBTQ+ rights in Russia since the 2000s. In the country, LGBTQ+ people can face job discrimination, are not allowed to marry, and risk arrest or harm. With Pride parades banned, Pride remains a fight for equality.

In 2020, staff at Greenpeace Russia organized a digital Pride month to promote solidarity. The initiative featured weekly challenges, articles, and discussions about LGBTQ+ media. To boost visibility and educate colleagues, the team also created visual materials such as rainbow frames and Zoom backgrounds. These efforts help foster trust and promote Diversity and Inclusion principles.

Their rainbow flag was featured on Greenpeace International's social media, which has inspired the team to continue their advocacy.
