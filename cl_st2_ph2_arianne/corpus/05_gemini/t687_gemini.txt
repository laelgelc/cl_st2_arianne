Our ongoing fight against forest destruction driven by palm oil continues. Major brands, including KitKat, Colgate, and Dove, are sourcing palm oil from 24 of the 25 most notorious palm oil companies in Southeast Asia.

Since 2015, these firms have been responsible for destroying over 130,000 hectares of rainforest. Their operations are also linked to worker exploitation, conflicts with communities, illegal deforestation, and devastating fires.

Despite promises made in 2010 to only purchase palm oil from responsible suppliers, these major brands are still using "dirty" palm oil. This connection is made through the trader Wilmar, which links the brands to the destructive producers.

We are calling for these brands to prove that their sourcing is not contributing to this destruction. We also urge the public to take action.
