In living systems, from vast ecosystems to complex human societies, the process of mutual learning is key. Nora Bateson’s book, "Small Arcs of Larger Circles," explores this idea, highlighting how permeable boundaries between entities enable interaction and adaptation.

The book puts forward new language to describe these relationships. It uses the term "vitae" for interconnected living entities and "symmathesy" to define the systems of mutual learning they form together. This perspective intentionally moves away from mechanistic views of the world, which can oversimplify how living systems function.

A practical application of this thinking is found in Bateson's Warm Data Labs. These sessions facilitate trans-contextual discussions around critical issues like carbon emissions. By bringing different perspectives together, the labs help foster new insights into multifaceted challenges, deliberately avoiding the trap of binary, right-or-wrong positions.

This approach understands change not as a simple fix, but as a process of shifting patterns and relationships within a system. Drawing on insights from ecology, art, and examples like cellular adaptation, this framework of interconnectedness is ultimately used to address pressing social and environmental injustices.
