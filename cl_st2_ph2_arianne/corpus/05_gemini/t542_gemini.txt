Last Friday, four million people took part in the largest climate protest ever. Protests spanned the globe, from Jakarta to Antarctica, all inspired by the courageous act of a 15-year-old the previous year.

For those of us at Greenpeace who remained at our desks to share the stories as they came in, it was a deeply inspiring day. The passion, energy, creativity, and even the humor on display moved some of us to tears.

We wanted to highlight some of our favourite protest signs from this historic event.

We are already looking forward to the next strike on September 27th.
