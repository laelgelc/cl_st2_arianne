The transformation of the Knepp Estate from a struggling farm into a thriving wild habitat provides a powerful example of rewilding as a solution to ecological crises. Based on the work of Isabella Tree, this project was inspired by ecologist Franz Vera’s ideas. The approach involved introducing free-roaming herbivores, including cattle, pigs, ponies, and deer, to the landscape.

The results have been profound, fostering soil restoration and a significant revival of biodiversity. The estate has seen the return of rare insects, butterflies, and birds, as well as the reappearance of orchids. This process has initiated trophic cascades, demonstrating the crucial role animals play in creating and shaping their own habitats.

This model of restoration stands in contrast to intensive farming, which is critiqued for causing soil erosion. The success at Knepp underscores the importance of healthy soil and its rich microbial composition. The project serves as a compelling case for letting nature self-restore. This principle is not isolated; the reintroduction of wolves into Yellowstone provides another powerful example of how allowing natural processes to resume can regenerate an entire ecosystem.
