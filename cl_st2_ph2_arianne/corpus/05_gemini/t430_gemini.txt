The devastating impact of COVID-19 in Brazil, which has seen over 57,000 deaths, is being exacerbated by illegal miners. These miners are invading Amazon Indigenous lands and are a potential source for spreading the virus.

According to the Articulation of Indigenous Peoples of Brazil (APIB), as of June 29, there were 9,294 confirmed cases and 383 deaths among Indigenous Peoples. The protection of their lands is urged to avert a potential genocide.

A Greenpeace flyover in May documented intense illegal mining activity in the Munduruku and Sai Cinza Indigenous Lands. These territories accounted for 60% of all deforestation alerts for mining in the Amazon between January and April 2020. The Yanomami Indigenous Land is also under threat, facing the presence of over 20,000 illegal miners.

Furthermore, deforestation caused by mining inside conservation units has increased by 80.62% compared to the same period last year. In response, Greenpeace filed a complaint which has resulted in a lawsuit demanding that authorities remove the illegal miners from these lands.
