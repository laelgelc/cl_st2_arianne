Between 2008 and 2016, Spain exported €22.6 billion in arms to more than 100 countries. Of these, 50 have been flagged as 'exports of concern' because of the high risk they could be used in human rights violations. These sales include weapons sent to Israel, Saudi Arabia, Brazil, and Iraq.

A deep secrecy protects these deals, driven by the profit motives of the military-industrial complex. This occurs despite the existence of the UN Arms Trade Treaty and EU regulations intended to prevent such sales.

On a global scale, arms sales are rising. Annually, $1.7 trillion is spent on war, a figure that stands in stark contrast to the minimal funding directed towards humanitarian aid. Greenpeace is calling for transparency in these deals to promote accountability and work towards peace.
