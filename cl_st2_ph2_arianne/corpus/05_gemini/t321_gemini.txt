Our voyage has taken us from the Caribbean Sea into the vast Pacific Ocean. While in the Caribbean, we saw flying fish and seabirds, including pelicans and boobies.

The next stage of our journey was the passage through the Panama Canal. The entire transit took three days to complete. This included a two-day queue before we could enter, followed by a nine-hour crossing through the canal’s six locks. We also used half a day for mast maintenance. During the crossing, we observed cranes, various waterfowls, and even a crocodile. Due to the pandemic, we took precautions with the Canal staff who came aboard.

Upon entering the Pacific, we were greeted by an abundance of marine life. We have encountered spotted and spinner dolphins, sea turtles, and tuna. Seabirds have also been a common sight. These encounters underscore the importance of protecting our oceans from threats like ghost nets and destructive fishing practices.
