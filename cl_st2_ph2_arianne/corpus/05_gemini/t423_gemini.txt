Knock, knock. It’s climate change, a persistent threat that continues even amid a pandemic. As the world considers its recovery from COVID-19, we are warned against resuming a heavy reliance on fossil fuels. We must protect our Earth, as there is no Planet B.

The climate crisis is already here. In South Asia, annual floods are worsening, affecting 9.6 million people. In China, 37.89 million people have been impacted, with 10,000 evacuated in Anhui and Hubei. In Bangladesh, one-third of the country is flooded, affecting 2.8 million people. Northeastern India has seen 6.8 million people affected, while devastation has also occurred in Nepal, Indonesia, and Japan.

In Kenya, floods between May and June displaced thousands, caused deaths, and destroyed crops and livestock. This is happening as East Africa experiences intensifying extreme weather due to the climate crisis.
