Lidl, the world's second-largest discount supermarket, has committed to the elimination of all hazardous chemicals from its textile production by January 1, 2020. This is a significant development, as Lidl sells over one billion euros in textiles annually and ranks among the top ten fashion retailers in Germany. The commitment will benefit communities affected by toxic pollution and help ensure a chemical-free future.

This move follows a similar announcement from Tchibo last month, signalling a growing trend within the industry toward quality over quantity. The decision by various brands to adopt Detox is a direct result of global customer pressure. It marks a victory for the four-year campaign and serves as an inspiration for further progress.
