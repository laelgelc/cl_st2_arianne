It is with heavy hearts that Greenpeace Nordic confirms our colleague, Carolina Nyberg-Steiser, 29, died in a tragic small amphibious plane crash. The incident occurred on Tuesday at 11:50 AM local time, as the plane was landing on the Rio Negro near Manaus, Brazil.

Carolina was visiting the Greenpeace Brazil office to meet with colleagues, learn about the Amazon protection campaign, and witness the forest firsthand.

The pilot and three other passengers from Greenpeace Brazil survived the crash with light injuries. There are no confirmed details available about the cause of the incident.

Out of respect for her family, we will not be providing further comments at this time. Carolina is deeply missed, and our thoughts are with her family.
