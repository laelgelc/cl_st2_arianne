The World Health Organization classifies processed meat as carcinogenic and red meat as probably carcinogenic, raising concerns about current meat consumption levels. The environmental impact of this industry is immense. Animal agriculture is responsible for 80% of Amazon deforestation and generates more greenhouse gases than the transport sector. It also uses 80% of the world's soy for animal feed.

The scale of production involves breeding 1 billion pigs, 19 billion chickens, and 1.4 billion cattle. This level of production has a significant resource footprint. For instance, producing one person's annual supply of meat and dairy requires 403,000 liters of water, an amount equivalent to 6,190 showers. Additionally, the system relies heavily on medication; in 2011, 8,481 tons of antibiotics were sold for livestock in the EU.

For significant health, ethical, and environmental benefits, we can reduce our weekly meat intake by half and choose to eat more local fruits and vegetables.
