In 2018, Greenpeace Malaysia campaigner Heng Kiah Chun met Pua Lay Peng in Jenjarom. Pua, a chemist, was leading the grassroots group Persatuan Tindakan Alam Sekitar Kuala Langat in response to pollution caused by imported plastic waste, an issue that intensified following China's import ban.

Pua mobilized a diverse group of community members, including drivers, lawyers, and housewives, to campaign for clean air and water. Through organized meetings, fieldwork, detailed reports, and formal complaints to authorities, their collective action led to the closure of over 300 illegal facilities.

Despite receiving death threats, they persisted, expanding their efforts to assist other areas and empower more communities to act. Pua also carried their message to an international audience, advocating in New Zealand and Brussels. For her work, she received a civil society award in 2019.
