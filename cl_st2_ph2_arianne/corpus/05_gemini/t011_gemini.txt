More than 100 climate activists from 17 countries, representing groups including Greenpeace and Extinction Rebellion, have been detained in Geneva for 20 hours. Their detention follows a peaceful protest at EBACE, Europe's largest private jet fair.

During the protest, activists occupied jets on display, chained themselves to gangways, and unfurled banners with messages such as "Burn Our Future," "Kill Our Planet," and "Fuel Inequality." They also broadcasted announcements highlighting the environmental and social harms caused by private jets.

Private jets are a symbol of injustice. They emit far more CO2 than trains, and their sales are booming amidst climate crises that disproportionately affect people who do not fly. The activists demand a ban on private jets and are calling for their immediate release. Supporters are being urged to sign a petition.
