The past few months have been challenging, as the global pandemic has introduced a 'new normal' for everyone. We extend our hopes and prayers for better days and a speedy recovery for all those affected by COVID-19, with the assurance that this too shall pass.

Amid ongoing lockdowns and social distancing, our opportunities for outdoor exploration have been limited. However, this moment encourages us to become armchair travellers. From our homes, we can still appreciate the awe-inspiring beauty of our Earth—from its snow-clad mountain peaks to the deepest oceans. Let us use this time to celebrate nature's wonders 365 days a year.
