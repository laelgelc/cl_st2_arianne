Siberia has emerged as a climate crisis hotspot, with mega fires ravaging its Taiga forests and blanketing Russian cities in haze. The firefighting response from authorities has been inadequately resourced, a failure that endangers communities and exacerbates climate change.

Since 2020, a staggering 19 million hectares have burned, an area larger than Greece. These fires have been concentrated mainly in Far Eastern Russia and Eastern Siberia. The resulting smoke is worsening air quality and causing respiratory issues, a severe threat to public health amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

Greenpeace Russia has been active on the ground, documenting fires in the Krasnoyarsk region and deploying volunteers to combat rare blazes in the Denezhkin Kamen reserve near the Urals. These fires were triggered by drought, heatwaves, and lightning.

This is a climate emergency. To safeguard people and the planet, authorities must halt cutbacks to forest protection.
