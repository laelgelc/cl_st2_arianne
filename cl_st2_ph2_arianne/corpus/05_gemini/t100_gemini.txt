The climate crisis is inflicting severe impacts across the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), where lives have been lost, homes destroyed, crops are failing, and livelihoods are threatened. This region is warming at twice the global average, leading to unprecedented droughts, floods, heatwaves, and other extremes in countries like Algeria, Egypt, Morocco, Tunisia, and the UAE.

A transition away from fossil fuels and towards renewables is urged for energy independence. At the same time, historic polluters are being criticized for refusing to make loss and damage payments. To address this, COP27 must establish a grant-based finance facility. This facility should provide funding for adaptation, mitigation, and compensation, enabling the region to recover and move toward a greener future.
