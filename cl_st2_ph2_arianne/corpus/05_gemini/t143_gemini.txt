Nature is collapsing due to rampant deforestation. At the upcoming COP15 summit in Montreal, leaders have a chance to protect biodiversity by recognizing the rights of Indigenous Peoples. This must include creating a new conservation category for their lands, where they lead both decision-making and funding.

The current model of "fortress conservation" must be rejected. This approach excludes local communities and is a form of colonialism, leading to abuses such as violence in Tanzania and Central Africa. In contrast, data shows that Indigenous management of ecosystems yields better protection.

Despite this, Indigenous Peoples often face displacement by industries. While there has been some progress in places like the Democratic Republic of Congo, much more investment is needed. At the Montreal summit, we must reject exclusionary models and fully embrace a just conservation framework that empowers Indigenous communities.
