A truckload of single-use plastic enters our oceans every minute. Only 9% of this plastic is actually recycled, and waste is often dumped in the global south. Companies such as Coca-Cola and Nestlé are urged to reduce the throwaway packaging they use for profit.

The problem also includes gadget waste, which is fueled by frequent technology upgrades. Apple, for example, releases new iPhones and deliberately slows down older models. This highlights the need for a "right to repair."

Marie Kondo's decluttering method can help spark joy, but it also reveals the environmental toll of excess consumption. We should embrace sustainable alternatives, such as repairing clothes instead of supporting fast fashion, an industry known for pollution and the exploitation of workers.
