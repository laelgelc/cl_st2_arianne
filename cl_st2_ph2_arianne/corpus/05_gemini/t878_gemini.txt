Following Greenpeace East Asia's July ranking of 30 global companies on their policies for phasing out microbeads in personal care products, we have seen several firms respond with updated commitments.

Amway Taiwan has stated it will replace microbeads with biodegradable ingredients in its sole affected product, starting from October 1, 2016. LG H&H has committed to stopping its use of microbeads by the end of 2016. A Japanese company, which has been switching to plant-derived materials since 2014, has now pledged a full phase-out by June 2018. Furthermore, Procter & Gamble is aiming for the removal of microbeads by 2017, Shiseido plans a global replacement by 2018, and Estee Lauder has expanded its commitment.

These steps are welcome, but we must urge for faster action to combat plastic pollution. Governments need to implement bans on microbeads, and consumers can play a part by checking product ingredients and supporting campaigns to end this source of pollution.
