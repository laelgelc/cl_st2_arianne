In 2018, the world witnessed devastating climate disasters, from floods and droughts to wildfires, cyclones, and the steady rise of sea levels. The responsibility for this lies with leaders whose inaction or ignorance has blocked essential solutions. By standing in the way of renewable energy and necessary protections, they are guilty of mass murder.

However, there is still hope. We are seeing the adoption of renewable energy in key countries like China, the US, and India. There was a near-success in establishing an Antarctic sanctuary, which would have brought sustainable krill and marine protections. Industries are also beginning to shift, with reforms seen in the tuna and palm oil sectors.

Power is also growing from the ground up. Youth-led movements are gaining momentum, and significant legal victories have been won against governments and fossil fuel companies. Alongside this, efforts are underway to challenge overconsumption.

The path forward requires joining the truth-sayers to build a green future. We have 12 years to act in the face of ongoing threats from fossil fuels, deforestation, and overfishing.
