In Wentworth, within the South Durban Basin, severe air pollution from refineries like Engen and SAPREF is causing a public health crisis. Research from the University of KwaZulu-Natal has revealed devastating consequences for the community, particularly its children, who suffer from high rates of asthma, cancer, and leukemia.

The pollution inflicts damage that extends beyond a single lifetime. It induces epigenetic changes, altering how genes are expressed and increasing the susceptibility to disease for generations to come. For residents like Shareeza Domingo and her family, the daily reality is one of chronic health issues. This is compounded by the wider community's struggles with poverty, unemployment, and social problems such as violence.

In response, activists like Desmond D’Sa are demanding accountability and compensation from the oil companies responsible. These corporations are accused of exploiting lax regulations. Now, even as they plan to abandon their sites, the community is confronted with the additional threat of further drilling operations.
