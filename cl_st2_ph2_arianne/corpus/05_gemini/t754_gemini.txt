We are concerned about Facebook's mishandling of user data, as highlighted by the Cambridge Analytica scandal. This situation enabled the manipulation of elections, posing a threat to democracy, privacy, and a green future.

Social media is a valuable tool for us to connect with supporters and organize actions. For this reason, we will not be deleting our pages. Instead, we are calling for accountability from Facebook and for governments to regulate data practices.

The business model of social media, which relies on extensive data collection for targeted advertising, is a point of critique. This model carries risks, including the potential for polarization.

We affirm that we safeguard our supporters' data and do not sell it. To address these issues, we urge action through Avaaz to enhance data privacy and protect democratic integrity.
