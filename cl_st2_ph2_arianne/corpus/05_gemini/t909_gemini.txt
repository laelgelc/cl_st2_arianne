Brecht Goussey is an organic farmer in Leuven, Belgium. A former social worker, he now runs a Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) farm on 1.5 hectares, supplying vegetables to 320 people who come to harvest them.

His dream is to expand his operation into an integrated farm, complete with crops, fruits, and animals. He envisions a farm that enhances biodiversity, using practices like manure to improve soil fertility. However, he faces a significant obstacle: uncertain access to his land and high prices driven by speculation prevent him from affording the plot.

To overcome this, Brecht is supported by ‘De Landgenoten’, a cooperative that buys land and rents it to organic farmers. Together with Greenpeace Belgium, Brecht is now crowdfunding to secure affordable farmland. The goal is to support ecological farming, promote community ownership of land, protect the soil, and foster biodiversity over the use of artificial methods.
