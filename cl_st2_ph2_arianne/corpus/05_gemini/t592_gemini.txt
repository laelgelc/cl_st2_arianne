Nine years ago, major brands promised to end deforestation by 2020. With just 200 days to go until that deadline, forests continue to be destroyed. An area the size of Spain has been at risk of destruction since that pledge was made.

Greenpeace surveyed more than 50 companies on their progress. Very few responded. Of those that did, not one was able to demonstrate any meaningful effort to end its relationship with suppliers linked to deforestation. This includes suppliers like Cargill, which has admitted it will not meet the 2020 deadline.

In Brazil, the Cerrado has lost almost half its native vegetation to make way for soya and cattle farming, threatening indigenous communities.

We are in a climate and wildlife emergency. To demand action, Greenpeace activists disrupted the Consumer Goods Forum Global Summit. Companies must end their part in deforestation and start restoring forests. They must act now or face extinction.
