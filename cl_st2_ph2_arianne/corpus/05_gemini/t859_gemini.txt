Encircling the Arctic is a vast green belt known as the Great Northern Forest, also called the boreal forest or Taiga. This forest is a powerful ally in the fight against climate change, storing more carbon in its soil than tropical forests. It provides a sanctuary for species like the Siberian Tiger, bears, and salamanders.

Life in this forest means enduring extreme seasonal shifts. In Siberia, winter temperatures can drop to -35°C, while summers can reach 25.5°C. To survive, animals adapt through methods like changing colour, using antifreeze-like chemicals, or hibernation. The dominant conifers, such as pine and spruce, also have their own survival strategies. They resist freezing with low-sap needles and have shapes that are effective at absorbing sunlight.

Protecting these ancient trees is crucial. It is vital to join the effort to safeguard this immense and important ecosystem.
