Fossil fuel companies are using soft power through sponsorships and influence to greenwash their reputations and maintain their climate-damaging business models.

This strategy can be seen across sports, where companies like Ineos and Total sponsor rugby events, and Gazprom holds a partnership with UEFA. The industry's reach extends into cultural spaces as well. Shell has funded museum exhibitions that were bound by non-criticism clauses, while ExxonMobil has supported the arts even as it actively denied climate science.

The influence of these companies also permeates education. Total, for example, has exerted influence at the prestigious École Polytechnique, and oil-sponsored programs are present in schools. These efforts are a calculated attempt to secure a positive public image while continuing business as usual.

To accelerate a green transition, there must be a call to end all fossil fuel advertising and sponsorships. There are already positive signs that this pressure is working, as the divestment movement continues to grow and youth are showing an increasing reluctance to be associated with the industry.
