Sri Lanka is currently enduring a severe environmental disaster. Tons of plastic pellets, the microplastics used for creating single-use packaging, have washed ashore on beaches near the capital. This has devastated the coastline and poses a significant threat to marine life. Authorities have issued warnings for people not to touch the pellets due to their potential toxicity.

The source of this pollution is the X-Press Pearl ship, which caught fire on May 20 following a nitric acid leak. This led to containers of the plastic pellets falling overboard into the sea. For such incidents, shipping companies should be held accountable. Furthermore, plastic ought to be classified as hazardous, with corresponding IMDG codes.

This crisis highlights a broken system in which fossil fuel companies and consumer brands prioritize profits, thereby fueling plastic pollution, climate change, health issues, and social injustice. Brands such as Coca-Cola, Nestlé, and Pepsi must move away from single-use plastics and instead implement global reuse systems.
