My journey in social justice and climate activism has now spanned a decade. In that time, I've been inspired by the rise of a new generation, and I want to introduce you to 10 young African climate activists who are making significant impacts across our continent.

These activists include Ahmed from Tunisia, Remy from the Congo Basin, and Dixon and Evelyn from Uganda. There's Winnie from Kenya, Gabriel and Raeesah from my home country of South Africa, Fatna from Morocco, Anisa from Libya, and Yero from Senegal. They are playing key roles in movements such as Youth for Climate and Fridays For Future, as well as leading vital tree-planting initiatives.

Their work is critical, especially when you consider that Africa is heating rapidly despite our low emissions. It is vital that we all support these youth climate efforts.
