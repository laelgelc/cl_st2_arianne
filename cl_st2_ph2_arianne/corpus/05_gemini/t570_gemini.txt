Greenpeace activists aboard the ship Esperanza have been protesting at the 25th Assembly of the International Seabed Authority (ISA) in Jamaica. We are there to highlight the ISA's failure to protect our deep oceans from the destructive threat of mining.

The ISA is failing for several key reasons. It is obsessed with exploitation over protection and lacks the capacity to properly address the environmental stresses that deep sea mining would cause. The authority consistently ignores concerns by prioritizing environmental impact assessments that are led by companies themselves and are not independent.

Furthermore, the ISA actively favors mining companies. It has never denied a license and allows for cozy ties between the industry and the supposed regulator. This body is also undermining the creation of a strong Global Ocean Treaty by lobbying for weaker governance, which would threaten marine life.

We are calling for ocean sanctuaries where protection is the priority. Please join us and sign the petition to help protect our oceans.
