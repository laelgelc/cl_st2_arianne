Reflecting on the joys and challenges of motherhood, I see a clear link to the suffering caused by climate change. The destruction, displacement, and loss of lives are a profound source of pain. Yet, I find hope in the communities that are resisting and in the African concept of Ubuntu. This is where the fight for climate and environmental justice finds its strength.

It is time for extractive companies and governments to be held accountable. They must stop the destruction, admit to their crimes, and pay for the damages they have caused, especially in low-income countries.

My childhood in Cameroon shapes my perspective. I remember playing in the forests, but I also remember experiencing floods and seeing my mother's struggles. The harms of fossil fuel extraction were clear: it led to the displacement of communities, the ruin of the environment, and global climate impacts. These consequences are not distant; they now affect even Germany, where I currently live.

I urge you to join the call. We must demand that fossil fuel companies halt all new projects and take responsibility for repairing the damages they have inflicted.
