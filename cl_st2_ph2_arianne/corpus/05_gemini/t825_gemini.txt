In response to a lawsuit by Resolute Forest Products against Greenpeace and Stand.Earth for advocating for the protection of the boreal forest, a movement of global solidarity has emerged. People in over 25 countries have gathered around iconic trees to oppose Resolute's efforts to silence critics and stifle free speech.

These gatherings have taken place at sites like Indonesia's Kenari Babi tree, Lebanon's 3,000-year-old cedar, and Germany's beech forests. The events highlight that forests are vital for biodiversity and for storing carbon, which is crucial to limit global warming to under 2°C.

This united global movement stands for the interconnectedness of nature's "web of life," defending both the world's forests and the right to speak out for their protection. We urge you to sign a petition calling for book publishers to support these causes.
