On March 15th, 1.5 million school students protested in the streets across 123 countries. They were driven by fear for their future, love for the planet, and anger over the inaction of leaders.

The students are challenging policy-makers and business leaders, asking if they are as smart as the students. This post highlights the most moving images from the event.
