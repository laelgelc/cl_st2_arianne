The 1969 Stonewall riots in New York were a moment when Trans Women, Drag Queens, and sex workers, including figures like Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia Rivera, resisted oppression. Their actions sparked global change for Queer rights.

Pride Month serves as a celebration of non-heterosexual value, yet it is important to note that 71 countries still criminalize same-sex activity.

As a conservation worker, I urge the recognition of Queer environmental activism, particularly as these communities face vulnerabilities due to climate change. Groups like Queers x Climate emphasize that social and environmental justice are inseparable. Fifty-three years after the riots, we should use Pride Month to advocate for the Earth's protection.
