Actors Alexander Skarsgard from *True Blood* and Jack McBrayer from *30 Rock* have teamed up with Funny or Die and Greenpeace for a three-part mini-series. The series, titled "Jack & Alex Set Sail," was filmed on a Greenpeace icebreaker in the Arctic Ocean off the coast of Greenland.

The project aims to raise awareness about global warming and to support the "Save the Arctic" campaign, which seeks to prevent fossil fuel drilling in the region. Skarsgard expressed his hope that viewers will appreciate the beauty of the Arctic and understand the importance of preserving it from becoming an oil field. McBrayer described his experience witnessing rolling icebergs, calving glaciers, and whales as phenomenal and inspiring.
