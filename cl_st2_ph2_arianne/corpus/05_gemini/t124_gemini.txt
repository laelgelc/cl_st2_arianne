A Greenpeace East Asia investigation reveals that Bumble Bee tuna has failed to uphold its sustainability and human rights commitments. The company’s Trace My Catch tool has proven to be unreliable.

Of 119 supplying vessels investigated, 13 were found to have violated regulations and appeared on Taiwan's IUU (Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated) fishing list. These violations involved offenses such as shark finning and illegal fishing. One Bumble Bee product was traced to the Da Wang, a vessel where a fisher died after experiencing abuse. This case led to indictments for forced labor and human trafficking.

Fishers who were interviewed for the investigation reported working overtime and having their wages withheld. The report highlights that seafood sold in the US is tainted, which contradicts Bumble Bee's own stated policies. Amid consumer support for traceability, the findings have led to calls for transparent supply chains.

The human impact is illustrated by Manny, a migrant fisher who witnessed the fatal abuse on the Da Wang and is now pursuing justice.
