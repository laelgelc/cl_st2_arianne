In July 2010, we commemorate the passing of Greenpeace founders Jim Bohlen, aged 84, and Dorothy Stowe, aged 89, highlighting their lives as agents of social change.

Jim Bohlen’s pacifism was shaped by the events of Hiroshima. He later immigrated to Canada and founded the Don't Make a Wave Committee, which led to Greenpeace's first anti-nuclear voyage to Amchitka.

Dorothy Stowe was a social worker, union leader, and peace activist. Her role was crucial in building coalitions and hosting the meetings where the organization took shape.

Greenpeace's origins are rooted in the hybrid culture of Vancouver, which was characterized by a mix of U.S. immigrants and different generations, all employing innovative media strategies. In remembering Jim and Dorothy, we honor the core founding couples of our movement.
