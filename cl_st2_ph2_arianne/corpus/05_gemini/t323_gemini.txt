Following a two-year campaign by Greenpeace East Asia, 7-Eleven Taiwan has announced it will phase out single-use plastics by 2050. This marks the first such commitment by a major Asian convenience store chain.

Our campaign efforts included retailer rankings and a 2020 investigation which revealed that 7-Eleven stores produce 15,000 tons of plastic waste annually. A petition supporting our cause also gathered 210,000 signatures.

7-Eleven Taiwan is aiming for 10% annual reductions and has launched pilot programs such as cup rentals and reusable delivery packages. While we welcome this development, Greenpeace urges the company to implement faster action and to expand this commitment globally.

Other companies are also making changes. Family Mart has implemented reusable container and cup programs, and Foodpanda offers plastic-free options for customers in Tainan.
