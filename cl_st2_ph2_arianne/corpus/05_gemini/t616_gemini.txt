Our oceans provide half of the Earth's oxygen and food for a billion people. They also play a crucial role in combating climate change by absorbing carbon.

In the unregulated open waters of our planet, diverse marine life thrives amid mountains and trenches. A strong UN Ocean Treaty is necessary to create sanctuaries in these areas.

To help achieve this, a Greenpeace team is aboard the Esperanza, embarking on a year-long expedition from the North Pole to the South Pole. The team will document threats to our oceans, conduct research, and advocate for their protection.

However, some industries are working to weaken the treaty. We need public support to counter them. By signing the petition, you can help implement a plan to protect one-third of our oceans from destructive activities.
