Our investigation into Asia Pulp & Paper (APP) and the Sinar Mas Group has uncovered the clearing of nearly 8,000 hectares of forest and peatland in linked concessions since 2013. This includes 3,000 hectares cleared in the concession of PT Muara Sungai Landak.

This destruction has occurred despite APP’s 2013 Forest Conservation Policy and its restoration commitments. While the company has made some progress, such as conserving over 500,000 hectares through the High Carbon Stock Approach and conducting peatland mapping, it has ultimately failed to address group-level deforestation and transparency issues.

Because APP has proven to be untrustworthy, Greenpeace has ended its engagement with the company. Moving forward, we will urge APP’s customers and investors to demand meaningful reforms or withdraw their support entirely.
