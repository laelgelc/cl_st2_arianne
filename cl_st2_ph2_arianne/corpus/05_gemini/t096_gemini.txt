At COP27, talks on "loss and damage" for climate-vulnerable communities have been formalized, marking a crucial step in the call for justice and an end to the business models of polluters. The climate crisis is driven by extractivism, a colonial legacy that continues to cause pollution and inequality, primarily benefiting richer nations.

Fossil fuels are at the heart of the crisis, generating emissions that necessitate an urgent shift to avoid future harms. We see the devastating impacts already, as droughts and floods wreck African economies.

For their own well-being, African leaders should reject any new investments in fossil fuels. Instead, they must demand the climate finance they are owed and take the lead in a just transition towards renewable energy.

Leaders such as Kenya's President Ruto and Morocco's King Mohammed VI are already providing a blueprint for this future. They exemplify how nations can leapfrog directly to clean energy, resisting neocolonial extractivism and addressing energy poverty on their own terms.
