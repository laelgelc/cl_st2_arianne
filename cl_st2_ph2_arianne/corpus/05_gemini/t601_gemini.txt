A world fully powered by renewables is possible, one that includes sustainable development, funding for a just recovery from climate impacts, and support for communities dependent on fossil fuels. The Green New Deal, introduced by Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Senator Ed Markey, presents a vision for equality that extends beyond partisanship. It has the support of a majority of people in the United States, including conservatives.

While the plan is imperfect, it needs to incorporate a phase-out of fossil fuels and a halt to new fossil fuel infrastructure. The urgency of the situation, as cited by the IPCC, demands action. This call is echoed by global youth movements and the declaration of climate emergencies in Ireland and the UK. Action is required to avert catastrophe, as the costs of inaction are high and disproportionately affect vulnerable groups.
