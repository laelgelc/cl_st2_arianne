Greenpeace mourns the deaths of Homero Gómez and Raúl Hernández. These Mexican activists were killed within days of each other for their work protecting monarch butterfly habitats in Michoacán from the threat of illegal logging. Homero Gómez was the manager of a sanctuary, and Raúl Hernández worked as a tour guide.

These murders are an example of a global pattern of violence that silences environmental defenders. This is happening amid threats like climate change and persistent corruption related to logging. In Latin America, targeted killings of environmental defenders occur on a weekly basis, as has been seen in places like Nicaragua.

We demand justice for these killings. We also call for solidarity and effective protection for land defenders around the world, who face unequal risks on the frontlines of the environmental crisis.
