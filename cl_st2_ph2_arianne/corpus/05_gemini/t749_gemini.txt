On the 32nd anniversary of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster, we are reminded of its widespread contamination and the ongoing risks that persist across Europe, particularly in Belarus, Ukraine, and Russia.

In this context, Rosatom is proceeding with a plan to deploy the world's first floating nuclear power plant, the 'Akademik Lomonosov', in the Russian Arctic. Its purpose is to support fossil fuel extraction along the Northern Sea Route. The plant is being relocated from St. Petersburg to Murmansk, where it will be fueled and tested. From there, it is scheduled to be moved to Pevek to supply electricity.

This project carries the risk of potential catastrophes. In the past, there have been other proposals for similar floating nuclear plants in countries such as Indonesia and the Philippines.
