Ocean advocate and Divein.com founder Torben Lonne recounts a dive in Thailand where he was teaching a young couple. The experience, set amidst stunning reefs and corals, was ruined by sudden influxes of plastic trash. He witnessed the plastic affecting marine life, including fish and turtles.

This personal story highlights the broader ocean pollution crisis. As much as 12 million tonnes of plastic enter our oceans every year, harming ecosystems and humans.

To combat this, Lonne urges individuals to take several steps. He calls on people to avoid single-use plastics and to pick up litter. He also suggests a method for pressuring companies directly: by photographing branded waste found in nature and posting it to social media with the hashtag #IsThisYours. Furthermore, he recommends convincing local businesses to reduce their plastic use and writing letters to newspapers to raise awareness. These actions are crucial for protecting the oceans for future generations.
