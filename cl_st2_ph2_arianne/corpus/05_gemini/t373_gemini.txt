In 2020, despite a pandemic that brought temporary emission reductions, the world faced intensifying climate emergencies, with the year remaining one of the hottest on record.

Across the United States, Hurricane Laura caused devastation, leading to deaths and widespread power outages. In Siberia, the crisis manifested as extreme heat waves, oil spills, and vast forest fires. The Amazon rainforest, crucial for regulating global temperatures, was also threatened by extensive fires. California experienced prolonged fire seasons that destroyed both lives and ecosystems.

In the Philippines, back-to-back typhoons resulted in floods and displacement, prompting calls for a climate emergency to be declared. The year also saw the impact of the Australian bushfires, while deadly floods caused massive damage in Kenya, Japan, China, Indonesia, and South Korea. These escalating events highlight the urgent need for collective action to combat climate change.
