Amid the COVID-19 crisis and its resulting economic shocks, we must prevent investments from flowing into planet-destroying industries. We must resist corporate exploitation of workers, a tactic of the Shock Doctrine that preys on crisis. Instead, funds must be directed toward a just transition for the health of our planet and its people.

It is time to hold our leaders accountable. We must invest in a future that is open, cooperative, equal, and peaceful, one lived in harmony with nature. Emphasizing cooperation and solidarity against the virus is crucial. This means building alliances and making the choice to protect the vulnerable over bailing out industries. We must learn the lessons of this moment through compassion, courage, and new leadership.

On a personal level, there are reflections on finding balance amid these challenges, alongside witnessing incredible acts of bravery and community.
