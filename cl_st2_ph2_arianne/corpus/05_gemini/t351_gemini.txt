The Fukushima nuclear disaster, triggered by a tsunami, is an event that can be compared to historical moments like 9/11, the 2004 tsunami, and Chernobyl. On its 10th anniversary, we reflect on the ongoing trauma for its survivors. A decade has proven insufficient to erase the pain of the mass evacuations and the spreading radiation contamination.

Reviewing Greenpeace's archives from 2011 to 2019 serves as a reminder of this long-term crisis. We have presented visual documentations of radiation in Japanese prefectures. Our role is to bear witness to these events. We do this to ensure that what happened is not forgotten and to continue our advocacy for a nuclear-free world.
