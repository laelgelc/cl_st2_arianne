A major review highlights how tropical deforestation causes significant harm to agriculture by altering temperature and rainfall patterns. This destruction creates drier, warmer conditions that increase risks to food production on both a local and a global scale.

Forests are vital for driving the water cycle. Through evapotranspiration, they provide essential cooling and release moisture that sustains rainfall. The loss of this function has severe consequences. For example, a 25% drop in Amazon soy yields is predicted. The impacts are far-reaching, with deforestation in the Amazon or Central Africa potentially causing reduced rainfall in the US Midwest. In West Africa, the loss of the Congo basin could intensify monsoons while causing temperature rises of 2-4°C and rainfall reductions of up to 50%.

To protect our climate, biodiversity, and food security, avoiding deforestation and restoring forests is crucial.
