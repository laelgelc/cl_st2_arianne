A Greenpeace UK survey of Scottish offshore oil and gas workers has revealed low morale and a significant lack of awareness about the energy transition, with only 9% familiar with the term "Just Transition." These workers are seeking supported retraining opportunities that lead to secure, well-paid jobs.

This highlights the urgent need to hold polluters accountable, enforcing the "polluter pays" principle. A Just Transition must be prioritized globally to ensure climate action is fair. The situation underscores the importance of solidarity between the environmental and labor movements, which is demonstrated by supporting striking workers and backing unions that demand decent jobs.

At COP26, Greenpeace is calling for ambitious commitments. In the United States, we are supporting President Biden's jobs plan and the PRO Act, advocating for unionized green jobs as a crucial step toward building a just society.
