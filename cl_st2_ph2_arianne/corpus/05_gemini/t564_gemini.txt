As we celebrate Shark Week, it’s a moment to appreciate some lesser-known facts about these incredible animals. Sharks have existed for 400 million years, surviving five mass extinctions. Recent discoveries continue to amaze us, like the tiny American Pocket Shark, which can secrete a glow-in-the-dark liquid.

Despite their ancient resilience, sharks face modern threats. They are frequently caught as bycatch in industrial fishing operations, feeding a global trade valued at $1 billion. In the North Atlantic, for instance, mako sharks are caught in excessive numbers.

Shark products are found worldwide, often in unexpected places. Squalene, derived from shark liver oil, is used in supplements, cosmetics, and even pet food, a practice which is harming shark populations.

To help these vital predators recover, a global oceans treaty is needed. Such a treaty would create protections for the high seas, where currently only 1% of our oceans are safeguarded. This is essential for the recovery of sharks and the health of our shared marine ecosystems.
