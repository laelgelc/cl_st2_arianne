In a significant win for a toxic-free future, EU member states have voted to ban the toxic chemical NPE from all textile imports. This decision closes a major loophole that allowed contaminated clothing to enter the EU market, even though a domestic ban on the chemical was already in place.

NPE, or nonylphenol ethoxylates, is used in the manufacturing of textiles and breaks down into nonylphenol, a chemical known to be hormone-disrupting. The issue was highlighted in a 2011 report, and this ban marks a crucial step forward. Supporters of the ban are now urging brands like Gap, Nike, and Diesel to take action and detoxify their supply chains.

The ban will take effect in five years, putting pressure on major textile exporters like China to reform their industrial practices. While this is a victory, the Greenpeace Detox campaign continues its work, calling for the complete elimination of all hazardous chemicals from our environment and products.
