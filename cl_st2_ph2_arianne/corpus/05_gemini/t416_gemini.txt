From his suburban apartment, Julien Jreissati experienced the Beirut port explosion. The blast was caused by 2,750 tons of ammonium nitrate igniting, which led to over 150 deaths, 5,000 injuries, and widespread destruction.

After checking on his loved ones, Jreissati formed a Greenpeace MENA crisis team. Their initial priority was to ensure the safety of their staff. The team also consulted experts to assess the health risks from the resulting nitrogen dioxide and ozone pollution. In the context of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, they developed safety guidelines for the public. Greenpeace MENA is currently using satellite imagery to investigate for additional pollutants.

As Lebanese solidarity aids in the recovery efforts, Greenpeace is providing information on how to deal with toxic dust. The organization is also calling for people to make donations to the Red Cross.
