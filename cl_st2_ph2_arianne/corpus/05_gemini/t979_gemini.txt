We are celebrating a major victory. With the help of 526,000 supporters, we have forced Volkswagen (VW) to reverse its opposition to EU laws that mandate more efficient cars. These laws will reduce CO2 emissions and our dependence on oil.

For two years, VW had lobbied against strong climate targets. In response, our campaign featured a viral Star Wars parody advertisement, protests with activists dressed as stormtroopers, and direct actions at car shows. This pressure resulted in VW changing its position to support the climate goals.

This success cuts pollution linked to climate change and helps protect vulnerable areas like the Arctic. It also signals the end of inefficient combustion engines. Following the campaign, VW has committed to becoming the world's greenest car company.
