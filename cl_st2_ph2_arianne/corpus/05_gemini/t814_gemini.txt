Last week, 65 activists from five countries delivered a clear message to EU leaders by unveiling a "Go solar!" banner outside the European Commission. This action urged them to support renewables and abandon dirty fuels, a critical demand as they undertake reviews of energy legislation.

This is part of a growing movement. For two years, since we first displayed a giant sun symbol in Paris during the Climate Conference to demand a shift from fossil fuels, these symbols have been appearing across the continent. Recently, suns have shone in Barcelona, Croatia, and other European countries including Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, and Slovenia.

The momentum is building, and it's not just activists. Ordinary people and businesses are ready to join the clean energy revolution. You can help push for a clean energy future by signing our petition and sharing the video.
