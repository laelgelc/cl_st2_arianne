In the Indian Ocean lives a tropical subspecies of blue whale known as the pygmy blue whale. These whales are smaller and lighter than their relatives, the Antarctic blue whales.

The legacy of commercial whaling decimated whale populations. This devastation is partly why we are only now making recent discoveries of different subspecies and realizing just how vulnerable they are due to their specialized habitats. Today, the threats they face continue, including ocean noise, ship strikes, habitat destruction, and climate change.

Whales are essential, playing a key role in our planet's ecosystems and in combating climate change. To protect them, there is a call for the creation of global ocean sanctuaries. The 1986 ban on whaling serves as a powerful reference for what can be achieved through collective action. Greenpeace is on the front lines of this effort with its Arctic Sunrise expedition, and public support is crucial to help safeguard these animals.
