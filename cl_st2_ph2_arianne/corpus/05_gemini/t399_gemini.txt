The post-Covid return to 'business as usual' has been a return to something worse. Public services are being slashed, environmental protections are being ignored, and funding is being directed to polluters. This is happening against a backdrop of crises, including Siberian wildfires and devastation across the Global South. Governments are choosing to prioritize economic growth over science, and we need real change, not greenwashing.

In response, Greenpeace is joining the Climate. Care. Uprising. We are uniting with grassroots groups in 16 European countries and around the world. Between September 23 and October 15, over 70 activities will take place to demand that recovery funds be used to address the interconnected crises of Covid, climate breakdown, neoliberalism, and colonialism.

The European Union's failures highlight the problem: a target of 55% emissions reductions by 2030 is insufficient when science demands 65%. We urge you to participate in these actions to demand that people and the planet are prioritized.
