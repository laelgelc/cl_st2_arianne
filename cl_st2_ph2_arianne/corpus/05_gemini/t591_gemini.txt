From June 16th to 21st, the 5th Global Sharing Week stands as a major event promoting a new way forward. It champions sharing as the foundation for a new system, one that can take us beyond the endless consumption and growth that harms our planet. We see the consequences of this system in the climate crises all around us, from devastating heatwaves to destructive floods.

The connection is clear: 70% of global emissions stem from urban consumption. But there is a powerful alternative. The act of sharing—through fixing, making, mending, and coming together for community events—directly reduces these emissions. It conserves resources while fostering innovation and a spirit of collectivity.

This is not a small movement. Sharing Week reaches over 100 million people annually, and events like MAKE SMTHNG in 2018 spanned 48 countries. To build lasting, bottom-up change, we must unite climate activists with the makers and sharers in every community. We urge you to participate in your local events and become part of the solution.
