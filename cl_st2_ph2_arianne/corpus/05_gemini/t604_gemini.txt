A state of emergency has been declared in Zabaikalsky krai, southeast Siberia, Russia, where wildfires have devastated the region. The fires have destroyed homes, farms, and livestock, resulting in one death and injuring 34 people.

Greenpeace Russia's firefighting team, led by Grigory Kuksin, is on the ground delivering humanitarian aid. The team is providing burn-treatment bandages, supplies for firefighters, and essentials like clothes and food to remote families who have been affected.

Kuksin described scenes of smoldering ruins and burnt prairies. The fires are spread rapidly by strong winds and are often started by arson. These events highlight the danger of human-caused fires. To prevent such tragedies, it is vital to always extinguish cigarettes and campfires properly. Please consider a donation to support this essential work.
