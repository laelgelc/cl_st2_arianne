Out on the high seas of the Pacific Ocean, fishing vessels are transferring their catches to motherships and refrigerated reefers, allowing them to operate for months or even years without entering a port. This practice, known as transshipping, facilitates overfishing, illegal fishing, and the evasion of regulations.

It also enables severe labor abuse. Reports from the International Labour Organization (ILO) have highlighted the vulnerabilities of workers, and an exposé by the Associated Press revealed the presence of slave-caught fish in supply chains.

The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) recommends prohibiting transshipping at sea. While some Pacific fisheries require advance notice and have banned the practice for purse seine vessels, these measures fall short. To protect our oceans, vulnerable tuna stocks, and the workers in the fishing industry, transshipping at sea must end.
