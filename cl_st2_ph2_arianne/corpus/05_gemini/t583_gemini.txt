The HBO series on Chernobyl has topped IMDb's list, praised for its accurate depiction of the 1986 disaster, including its period details and the residents' lack of awareness of the danger they were in.

The catastrophe's effects, however, persist. In the aftermath, 350,000 people were evacuated, and today, 5 million people still live in contaminated areas. While the World Health Organization estimates 9,000 more deaths will result from the disaster, Greenpeace research suggests the number could be as high as 100,000 from radiation-exacerbated cancers. The risk is not confined to the past, as ten similar reactors continue to operate in Russia.

In places like Novozybkov, despite decontamination efforts, people consume and sell radioactive mushrooms and berries. This demonstrates how the errors of nuclear power impose long-term costs on ordinary people, with consequences that are felt across generations.
