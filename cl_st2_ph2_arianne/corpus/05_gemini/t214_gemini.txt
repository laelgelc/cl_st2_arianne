To combat plastic pollution, we must accelerate the shift to reuse and refill systems. This transition is being driven by global pressure and is supported by policies.

According to a report from the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, the ambition for reuse in the consumer goods sector is currently insufficient. However, initiatives are underway to address this, such as the World Economic Forum's effort to unite stakeholders for reuse policies. Scaling up reuse offers significant environmental and economic benefits. In the food and beverage sector alone, it could potentially save 27.1 million tonnes of resources by 2030.

There is a clear call for a binding Global Plastics Treaty to reduce plastic production and promote reuse. Progressive laws supporting this goal have already been established in countries including Austria, France, Portugal, Romania, Spain, Chile, India, and Indonesia.
