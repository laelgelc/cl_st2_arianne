The EU's proposed law to reduce its contribution to global deforestation and human rights abuses is a historic step, but it is flawed.

The law would require companies to trace high-risk commodities to ensure they are sustainable. However, its protection is limited only to forests, excluding other vital ecosystems like savannas and wetlands. The proposal also ignores products such as rubber, maize, pork, and poultry.

Furthermore, the rights of Indigenous peoples remain unprotected under this law. The role of the finance sector and its investments in destruction are also overlooked.

Despite resistance from corporations, public pressure on EU governments and the European Parliament is needed to strengthen the law. This effort can build on the pledges made at COP26 and is supported by a petition for clean supply chains signed by 1.1 million people.
