For 30 months, an Indonesian fisher named Pukaldi did not touch land. Kept at sea by transshipment practices common in distant water fishing, he was subjected to long hours, poor conditions, and unpaid wages.

His experience highlights the systemic exploitation of migrant workers, which is linked to illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing. Greenpeace Indonesia's Beyond Seafood campaign works to combat slavery at sea as part of the effort to improve ocean governance.

Alongside SBMI, Pukaldi sued the government for its delay in issuing a regulation needed to implement a 2017 worker protection law. Following the lawsuit, the regulation was signed in June 2022, and the lawsuit was subsequently revoked. Efforts continue to ensure the law is implemented and to address the unpaid wages owed to workers.
