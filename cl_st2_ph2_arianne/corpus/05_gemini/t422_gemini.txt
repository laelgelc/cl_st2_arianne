The COVID-19 pandemic is exacerbating the problem of plastic pollution through the increased use of disposable PPE, such as face masks. We are facing another waste crisis on top of an existing plastic overload.

To protect both our health and the environment, we are urging people, except for frontline workers, to opt for reusable masks. These can even be homemade.

We can draw lessons from Japan, where mask-wearing has a long history dating back to the 1918 Flu Pandemic. There, wearing a mask is seen as an act of altruism for society. In the same spirit, we must now consider our planet. The key lessons are clear: we must wear masks to safeguard others from the virus, and we must choose reusable options to address both the health and environmental challenges we face collaboratively.
