As Greenpeace International's Executive Director, I attended Davos to speak truth to power. Amid escalating climate crises, it was vital to appeal directly to the humanity of corporate leaders.

I was there to promote our "Justice for People and Planet" report. This report analyzes 20 cases of corporate exploitation where legal loopholes, tax treaties, and regulatory capture have been used to harm human rights and the environment. Some of these examples include Volkswagen's dieselgate scandal, the SLAPP suits initiated by Resolute and Energy Transfer, pollution caused by Glencore, and the role of ACS in the Renace project in Guatemala.

In response, the report proposes a set of Corporate Accountability Principles. These principles urge for corporations to be held liable for their violations. They also state that companies should be prohibited from engaging in activities abroad that are banned in their home countries.

The connection between this behaviour and our reality is stark. Extreme weather is now recognised as a top global risk, a risk directly linked to climate change and the urgent need for corporate responsibility.
