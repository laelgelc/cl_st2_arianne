Merlin Sheldrake's book, "Entangled Life," explores the vital roles fungi play within our ecosystems. It delves into the function of mycorrhizal networks, often called the "Wood Wide Web," which are central to these interconnected systems. The book examines symbiotic relationships where fungi are essential partners, providing crucial nutrients to plants such as the Ghost pipe and various orchids. These networks also serve as a communication channel, enabling signal transmission between plants for pest defense.

Beyond their role in plant life, fungi offer significant medicinal benefits, with the potential to combat viruses in both bees and humans. Sheldrake’s work challenges conventional notions of individuality, instead emphasizing a model of collective survival within interwoven biomes. This perspective brings a sharp critique of industrial agriculture, highlighting the destruction it inflicts upon the soil. Drawing on a foundation of historical and scientific examples, the book ultimately points towards the immense potential of fungi in the field of ecological restoration.
