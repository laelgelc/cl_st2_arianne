In São Gabriel da Cachoeira, Brazil, Indigenous women leaders Elizângela da Silva of the Baré people and Janete Alves of the Desana people have led a critical response to the COVID-19 pandemic. As coordinators of FOIRN's Women's Department, they pivoted from their usual work with handicrafts to organizing the production of protective masks.

Inspired by television reports, they recruited artisans, utilized donated patterns, and learned from online tutorials to launch the effort. This initiative has since produced over 16,000 masks, which have been distributed among 23 Indigenous Peoples in the Rio Negro region.

The project is funded by the "Rio Negro, Nós Cuidamos" campaign, and Greenpeace's Wings of Emergency has supported their work by providing sewing machines.

Amid this life-saving work, the women are also navigating profound grief from losses in their communities, including elders who were cremated without traditional rites. They persist, relying on traditional medicines and their determination to save lives.
