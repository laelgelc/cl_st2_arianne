Taiwan's diverse coral reefs are facing widespread bleaching. This is a result of record-high sea temperatures, which have exceeded 30°C, combined with fewer typhoons and the continuous warming of the ocean due to climate change. Other causes contributing to this problem include pollutants such as agricultural pesticides, wastewater, and harmful chemicals found in sunscreen.

The impacts of this bleaching are severe, leading to large-scale coral mortality and the disruption of the ecosystem, which in turn affects marine life. The loss of healthy reefs also diminishes protection against coastline erosion and negatively impacts both tourism and fisheries. Recovery is a significant challenge, given that corals grow slowly, at a rate of about 1cm per year.

Addressing this crisis requires ambitious carbon reduction, which can be achieved by replacing fossil fuels with sustainable energy sources. Ongoing preservation efforts are also necessary to combat the broader issues of global warming and ocean acidification.
