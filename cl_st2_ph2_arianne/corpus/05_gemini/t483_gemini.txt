In a huge victory for our planet, Equinor has abandoned its plans for oil drilling in Australia's Great Australian Bight. This success, which protects precious marine life and will keep over 800 million tonnes of carbon locked up, came after powerful campaigns by communities, Indigenous owners, and Greenpeace. The company cited a lack of commercial viability for its decision.

Another significant setback for the fossil fuel industry occurred in New Zealand, where OMV's offshore well came up empty, yielding no oil. This failure undermines the industry's future in the country, which has seen widespread protests and a ban on new offshore oil and gas permits.

Meanwhile, in Canada, Teck Resources has withdrawn its application for what would have been the country's largest tar sands mine. The company acknowledged that economic and climate pressures were behind its decision, a move that benefits both Indigenous communities and the environment.

These events are clear reflections of the power of people and the ongoing decline of the oil industry.
