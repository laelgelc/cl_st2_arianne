Orpha Novita Yoshua, a young Indigenous Namblong woman from the Grime Nawa Valley in West Papua, Indonesia, has written to UN Biodiversity Secretary Elizabeth Maruma Mrema at COP15. She stressed that forests in Papua, Kalimantan, and Sumatra are vital for biodiversity, climate protection, and Indigenous cultures, warning of crises like species extinction and cultural loss if they are damaged.

Describing her valley's rich ecosystem, which includes cassowaries, birds of paradise, sago palms, and sacred forests, she gifted a symbolic Noken bag. Orpha condemns the palm oil company PT Permata Nusa Mandiri for illegally clearing land without consent. In light of government inaction, she is urging for the company’s permit to be revoked.
