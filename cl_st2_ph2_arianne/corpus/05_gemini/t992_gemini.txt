Our current model of economic growth is fundamentally flawed. It relentlessly pursues expansion while ignoring its devastating costs, such as the destruction of our ecosystems. Even our attempts at efficiency often backfire due to the rebound effect, where improvements in efficiency simply fuel more consumption rather than reducing it.

This blind pursuit of growth defies a fundamental lesson from the natural world. In nature, as in history and biology, unchecked growth doesn't lead to prosperity; it leads to overshoot and collapse. There are always limits.

An alternative vision is offered by the degrowth movement, which advocates for reducing our material throughput to achieve sustainability and equity. This approach makes a crucial distinction: it calls for a reduction in physical consumption, not in non-material growth like the expansion of ideas or diversity. The focus is on conservation, simplification, and the sharing of resources.

Critically, we must acknowledge that wealthy nations currently export the harms of their growth, forcing poorer countries to bear the environmental and social consequences. The degrowth movement suggests a different path, one that leads to richer lives not through endless consumption, but through stronger communities and greater creativity.
