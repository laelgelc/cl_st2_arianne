Two hundred Brazilian civil society organizations, including Greenpeace Brazil, have sent a letter to the US government. The letter urges the United States not to support President Jair Bolsonaro's destructive environmental policies through secretive negotiations.

These ongoing talks involve the possibility of billions in US funds aimed at curbing deforestation in the Amazon. However, the letter points out that Bolsonaro's administration has significantly increased deforestation, harmed Indigenous Peoples, and weakened Brazil's climate commitments to levels below those established in the Paris Agreement. The government has also failed to make use of existing international funds intended for environmental protection, such as the Amazon Fund.

The organizations warn that any deal with the current Brazilian administration would serve to legitimize its anti-environmental actions. They also caution that resources from such an agreement would likely be directed to large landowners. The letter concludes that a deal would ultimately undermine the climate leadership of the US government under President Biden.
