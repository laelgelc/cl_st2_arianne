In an interview with vegan dietitian Heather Russell from The Vegan Society, we discussed the increasing popularity of vegan cafes and the surprises one can find in plant-based meals.

Russell emphasized the importance of balanced nutrition, advising a focus on whole grains, nuts, fruits, vegetables, and legumes to avoid the pitfalls of high-fat, sugary vegan junk food. For those following a vegan diet, she noted that essential supplements include vitamin B12, vitamin D, iodine, and selenium.

She also addressed the accessibility of veganism, stating that it can be both affordable and culturally adaptable.

When considering sustainable choices, Russell promotes eating seasonal produce. She also offered a critique of lab-grown meat, specifically if its production involves animal products.

Looking to the future, Russell predicts a significant shift toward plant-based diets, driven by their environmental and health benefits. For anyone looking to start, she suggests simple steps like adding legumes to meals and trying plant milks.
