We extend our gratitude to our supporters, especially as we face lawsuits exceeding a billion dollars from companies like Resolute Forest Products and Energy Transfer Partners, which are aimed at silencing activism.

Despite these challenges, we have achieved significant global milestones together. Our Make SMTHNG week events have successfully promoted creation over consumption. Campaigns have pressured Thai Union to commit to more sustainable fisheries, and we have seen a major response to the EU glyphosate petition. Our work contributed to the protection of Brazil's Amazon, and we successfully pushed Samsung to implement a policy shift regarding its Galaxy phones.

Internally, we are dedicated to strengthening our commitment to diversity and inclusion and are integrating the principles of the #MeToo movement. Much of our crucial work happens behind the scenes, including campaign planning, training our teams, providing scientific support for our actions, and managing our ships.

We also celebrate successes in achieving coal phase-outs, promoting divestment from fossil fuels, and exposing unfair trade deals. We must continue our collaboration to work towards a sustainable planet.
