In a collaborative effort, Greenpeace CEE has partnered with Ukrainian organizations Ecoaction, Ecoclub, and Victory of Ukraine to reconstruct a war-damaged hospital in Horenka, located near Kyiv.

The project centered on installing a heat pump with 65-meter ground probes and a hybrid solar power system. This sustainable upgrade enhances the hospital's energy independence while reducing CO2 emissions. The new system is projected to cut heating costs by 80% and can cover up to 60% of the facility's energy needs.

With a total cost of €56,000, the investment is expected to be recouped in 6-7 years. This initiative exemplifies the "Build Back Better" principles by choosing modern, sustainable technology over outdated systems. The aim is now to partner with European cities to support similar sustainable reconstruction projects during Ukraine's recovery.
