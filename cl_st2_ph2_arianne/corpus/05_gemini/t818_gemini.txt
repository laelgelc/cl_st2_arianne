In the Great Northern Forest, a recently clearcut logging site stands as a barren wasteland where ancient trees once grew. This destruction has wiped out vital habitats for countless insects, birds, mushrooms, and lichen.

According to Lina Burnelius, a forest campaigner with Greenpeace Nordic, the responsibility for this devastation is linked to Essity, the producer of Tempo and the world's second-largest tissue company. Essity sources pulp from suppliers that are expanding their operations into critical, biodiversity-rich forests in Sweden, Finland, and Russia.

We are urging Essity to protect these invaluable areas. The company must shift its sourcing to sustainable forestry practices outside of these critical landscapes and increase its use of recycled materials. We call on you to join us in demanding that Essity commit to a cleaner supply chain.
