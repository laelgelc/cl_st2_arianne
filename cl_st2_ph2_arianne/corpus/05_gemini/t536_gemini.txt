Corporate "solutions" to the plastic pollution crisis are often just a distraction. Approaches like switching to paper packaging harm forests, while the push for bioplastics creates competition with food crops and fails to solve the problem, as these materials do not degrade properly in nature. Similarly, promoting recyclable plastics is a flawed strategy because these materials are rarely recycled and are frequently downcycled into lower-quality products.

These methods merely shift from one material to another without tackling the fundamental issue. They do nothing to change the throwaway model that is responsible for generating massive amounts of waste.

Instead of pursuing these false solutions, companies must prioritize genuine waste reduction. The path forward requires investment in reuse and refill systems. These are the real solutions that global activists are demanding to end the pollution crisis.
