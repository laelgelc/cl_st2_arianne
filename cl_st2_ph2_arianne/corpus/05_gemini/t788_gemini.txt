For Penguin Awareness Day, we are ranking Antarctic penguins in a countdown, highlighting their unique adaptations.

Chinstrap penguins appear squat and serious, resembling little helmet-wearers. Next are the Macaroni penguins, who are monogamous crested cousins of Rockhoppers. They nest on the Antarctic Peninsula and feed on krill.

Gentoo penguins are distinguished by their white head patches and brush-like tails. They are known for their loud trumpeting calls and can swim at speeds up to 36 km/h, diving hundreds of times each day. The largest of all are the Emperor penguins. They dive the deepest and use bubbles for hydrodynamics. In the winter, the dads huddle together to protect their eggs.

Topping our list are the Adélie penguins. These tough and adorable birds are rock-nest builders, using pebbles as a core part of their mating and society.

These incredible penguins and their home need protection, which is why we are promoting a Greenpeace campaign for an Antarctic Ocean Sanctuary.
