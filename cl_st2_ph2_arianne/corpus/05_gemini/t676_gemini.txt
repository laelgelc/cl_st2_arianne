The Urgenda Foundation's victory in the Dutch Court of Appeal has upheld a 2015 ruling. This ruling requires the Netherlands to cut its emissions by 25% from 1990 levels by 2020. Having achieved only a 13% cut so far, the country's remaining coal plants will need to be shut down.

This decision emphasizes the role of courts in enforcing human rights obligations against the harms caused by climate change. Coinciding with the IPCC's 1.5°C report, the ruling is a warning to governments worldwide to update their policies or face potential lawsuits.

Around the world, legal actions for climate justice are growing. Global cases include those filed by Swiss seniors, youth in the U.S., and investigations in the Philippines into fossil fuel companies.
