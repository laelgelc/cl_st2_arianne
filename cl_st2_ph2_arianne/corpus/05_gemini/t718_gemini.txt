Greenpeace Russia has conducted a survey of World Cup host cities to assess their measures on air pollution. The survey identified vehicle emissions as the primary concern. Resident dissatisfaction with air quality is high in several cities, including Moscow, where 82% are dissatisfied, St. Petersburg with 77% dissatisfaction, and Kazan with 60%.

Some cities have taken positive steps. Moscow has introduced restrictions on low-emission vehicles, installed charging stations for electric vehicles, and developed bike paths. St. Petersburg is focusing on electric transport and bike infrastructure. The authorities in Rostov-on-Don have critiqued the expansion of road infrastructure, and Yekaterinburg is offering sustainable transport options.

However, other cities are lagging. Samara and Volgograd lack serious action on the issue. The city of Sochi has rejected recommendations to improve air quality. Furthermore, the administrations of Nizhny Novgorod and Saransk did not respond to the survey.

Greenpeace plans to continue its work to hold the authorities accountable for their commitments and urges people to join the movement for clean air.
