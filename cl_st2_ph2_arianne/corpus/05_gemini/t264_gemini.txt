The climate crisis is real and urgent. We must stop pipelines, an effort that must be supported by Indigenous-led resistance. The goal is to achieve zero global emissions, which requires halving them by 2030. Ahead of COP26, government targets must be aligned with the 1.5°C warming limit.

Financial institutions must divest from fossil fuels and end the practice of greenwashing. There can be no new investments in fossil fuels as we push for a just transition.

We must fix the food system by ending deforestation and promoting plant-based diets. This includes protecting 30% of our ecosystems and supporting Indigenous rights. Our transport systems also need to be transformed.

To prepare for climate impacts, we must do so justly, applying the polluter pays principle. Solidarity must be ensured through climate finance. The recovery from COVID-19 presents an opportunity that should be leveraged for a green recovery, driven by the power of people.
