At the Copenhagen global fashion summit, Shein announced a $15 million donation to a non-governmental organisation in Ghana that assists textile waste workers. However, Viola Wohlgemuth, a campaigner for Greenpeace Germany, has described this as greenwashing if the company does not also change its business model.

Shein's ultra-fast fashion approach leads to the production of cheap, disposable clothes, a practice that wastes resources and exploits people and the environment. Returned items are also frequently sent to landfill. This issue is widespread, as Greenpeace research in Kenya and Tanzania has revealed discarded clothing polluting dumps, rivers, and seas, which mirrors the problems occurring in Ghana.

Brands like Shein should follow the 'Polluter Pays' principle to take responsibility for the global damages they cause. They need to shift their business model to one that produces fewer items that are durable and repairable. By implementing circular services, companies can work to preserve resources.
