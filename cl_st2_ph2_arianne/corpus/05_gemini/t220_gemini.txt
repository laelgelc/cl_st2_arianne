A new study from Greenpeace Russia and the University of Maryland warns that without urgent measures, most of Earth's wild forests will vanish in just 20 years. These Intact Forest Landscapes (IFLs) are defined as areas over 50,000 hectares that are free of settlements or roads.

Between 2000 and 2020, 12% of these wild forests were lost, an area equivalent to three Spains. Projections show that a third of the world’s remaining IFLs could be gone by 2050.

The climate crisis exacerbates these losses, causing extended fires and droughts in northern regions like Russia, Canada, and Alaska. In Brazil's Amazon, rapid degradation is driven by industrial animal farming and land-grabbing, which displaces Indigenous communities. Losses are also increasing in the DRC, Indonesia, and tropical South America. In contrast, Canada and the USA have managed to reduce their rates of loss.

These wild forests are vital to our planet. They store carbon, house Indigenous cultures, provide habitats for wildlife, and help prevent erosion and floods.

To protect them, several actions must be taken. We must halt wood harvesting projects and end the industrial production of meat, dairy, soy, and palm oil. It is also crucial to avoid the fragmentation of these forests, recognize Indigenous rights, and prioritize people over corporate profits.
