For six-year-old Lucas, daily life involves nasal congestion, a runny nose, and nosebleeds. He suffers from allergic rhinitis, which is likely caused by air pollution from the heavy traffic near his apartment in Hong Kong. His mother, Margret, is forced to keep the windows closed and wipes soot from them multiple times a day.

To understand the severity of their situation, Margret and Lucas joined Greenpeace Hong Kong's Citizen Science Research program. They installed tubes to collect samples of Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2), and the results revealed poor air quality in their area. NO2 is a pollutant known to irritate mucous membranes and hinder the respiratory development of children.

This is a widespread problem. Last year, nine out of 16 air quality monitoring stations in the city recorded pollution levels that exceeded national standards. To protect the health of its citizens, the government must take action to curb the growth of private cars and work to electrify public transport.
