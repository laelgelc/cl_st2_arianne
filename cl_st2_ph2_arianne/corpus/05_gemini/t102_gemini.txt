As our United for Climate Justice ship tour continues, the message is clear: the voices of youth from the Middle East, Africa, and beyond must be heard at COP27. This was the urgent call from Greenpeace MENA campaigner Nouhad Awwad.

A powerful movement is building. Over 400 youth climate leaders recently gathered in Tunisia to strengthen their collective efforts. Now, some of these dedicated advocates are sailing on the Rainbow Warrior in Egypt, carrying with them the fight for climate justice for the Global South.

These regions are on the frontlines of a crisis they did not create, facing severe impacts like devastating droughts, floods, famine, desertification, and rising sea levels. All the while, rich nations are failing to provide the essential financial support needed to cope with this reality.

Our tour is here to deliver messages of hope, solidarity, and concrete solutions. We are amplifying the call for an immediate transition away from fossil fuels and demanding the climate justice necessary to protect the future for all generations.
