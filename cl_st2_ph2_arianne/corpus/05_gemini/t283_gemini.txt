For 50 years, the oil industry has boomed in Scotland, but it is now changing. This is leading to rising unemployment among workers, increased use of food banks, and losses for communities.

Ravishaan Rahel Muthiah, a digital campaigner for Greenpeace UK, is working for a just transition to clean energy and green jobs. To understand the situation better, Greenpeace interviewed current and former oil workers.

Wullie spoke about the hardships of working offshore, as well as redundancies and the health impacts he has faced. Robbie described the barriers to transitioning into new work, like the high fees for training. Yvonne shared her view that the government needs to prioritize the planet over the profits of oil companies. Alan, another worker, spoke of a hopeful future in renewables.

These stories highlight challenges that are common among workers. People tied to polluting industries should not be the ones to bear the burden of the climate crisis. That is why Greenpeace UK, along with Friends of the Earth Scotland and Platform, is campaigning for supported transitions to secure green jobs.
