A "just transition" must address not only those affected by the shift to green energy but also communities enduring the legacy of pollution from the old system. In places like South Durban, South Africa, residents face a combination of poverty, illness, and ongoing air pollution from industrial sources.

Research has established a link between social determinants and pollution, showing they amplify health risks. These risks include in-utero effects on the development of children's lungs, hearts, and brains. The consequences extend to neurocognitive outcomes, such as reduced IQ.

These impacts create a generational cycle of disadvantage. The problems can persist even when there are reductions in some pollutants. The Covid-19 pandemic served as an example of how these combined inequities manifest.
