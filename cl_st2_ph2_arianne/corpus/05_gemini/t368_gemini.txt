Dorothy Stowe, who would be 100 today, co-founded Greenpeace in Vancouver with her husband Irving and other pacifists and ecologists. She passed away ten years ago in the same city. A 2009 photo captures her at a CD release party for the 1970 concert that launched Greenpeace, which featured Joni Mitchell and James Taylor.

She exemplified unwavering dedication, modesty, and kindness. Her activism was focused on issues rather than herself, and she was known for volunteering for any task. She remained unintimidated, even by figures like Canada's Prime Minister. Dorothy and Irving held their wedding at NAACP headquarters. They became Quakers dedicated to peace and justice and adopted the name "Stowe" from Harriet Beecher Stowe. In Greenpeace's early years, they provided a stabilizing and inclusive influence, inspiring others through hard work and heart.
