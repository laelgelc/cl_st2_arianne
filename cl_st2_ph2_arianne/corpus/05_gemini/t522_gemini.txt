Over 5 million people worldwide have demanded that companies like Nestlé reduce their single-use plastic production. Brand audits have recently identified Coca-Cola, Nestlé, PepsiCo, Mondelez, and Unilever as the top polluters.

To push for systemic change and promote refillable systems over throwaway packaging, you can join Global Refill Day on November 6. The action is simple: take a reusable container to a supermarket, cafe, or restaurant and request a fill. Photograph the before and after, and then share it on social media using the hashtags #ReuseRevolution and #BreakFreeFromPlastic. Remember to tag the company and @greenpeace.

This movement is inspired by initiatives such as Indonesia's Zero Waste Living Lab, the establishment of refill stations, the creation of zero waste cities, and commitments from celebrities. To find out more, you can explore other actions through Break Free From Plastic's Global Week of Action.
