For movie director Wang Shaudi, filmmaking is a social movement and a means of self-improvement. Her work explores the critical balance between environmental conservation and economic development in Taiwan, as seen in her 2003 film *Banquet*. Through her process of conducting fieldwork and consulting with experts, she has brought attention to the stress on land caused by climate change.

Her advocacy is not limited to her films; she has taken a stand against nuclear energy and for marriage equality. She also integrates her principles into her daily life and work, promoting eco-friendly efforts by implementing waste sorting on her sets and personally using a walking bicycle.

Despite these actions, she has expressed feelings of powerlessness when confronted with extreme weather events like the Australian fires and Chinese floods. However, she continues her work, drawing inspiration from moments such as witnessing an indigenous musician playing amidst trash on a beach. Such scenes reinforce her conviction that we must adjust our lifestyles to secure a better future.
