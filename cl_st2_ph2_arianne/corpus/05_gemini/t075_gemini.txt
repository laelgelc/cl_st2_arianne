At the Rebuild Indonesia Youth Festival, Greenpeace engaged with around 200 young people in an activity called "Dare to Dream." The goal was to visualize a better future for Indonesia, one free from oligarchy, injustice, and environmental crises.

Using the MidJourney AI tool, participants inputted keywords such as clean cities, no pollution, green spaces, safe streets, and community. This process generated a diversity of images, with artists on hand to help refine the visions.

The initiative was designed to inspire hope and imagination. It also aimed to spark conversations about alternatives to infinite growth models, the idea of taxing oligarchs, and canceling GDP. The activity emphasized the crucial role of youth in co-creating a sustainable world.
