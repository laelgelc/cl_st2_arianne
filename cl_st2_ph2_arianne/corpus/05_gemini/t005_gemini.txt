The distinction between a queen bee and a worker bee is a result of the queen's prolonged consumption of royal jelly. This diet enables queens to live longer, grow to a larger size, and lay millions of eggs.

Beekeeping in Korea dates back to the Three Kingdoms period, from which it spread and became a symbol of diligence and wealth. However, in 2022, Korea lost 16% of its honeybees. This disappearance has been linked to the climate crisis, parasites, a decrease in honey plants, and the use of pesticides. In response, there is an urge to create a "Save the Honeybees Committee."

Bees evolved from carnivores and possess five eyes. They make democratic decisions using dances, and their duties are assigned based on age. Their lifespans are seasonal, and they rely on honey plants, undertaking extensive foraging efforts to produce honey.
