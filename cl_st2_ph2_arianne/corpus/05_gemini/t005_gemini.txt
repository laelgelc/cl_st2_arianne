The distinction between a queen bee and a worker bee arises from the prolonged consumption of royal jelly. This diet enables the queen to live longer, grow to a larger size, and lay millions of eggs.

In Korea, beekeeping has a history that traces back to the Three Kingdoms period, from which it later spread. Culturally, bees are regarded as a symbol of diligence. However, a significant challenge has emerged. By early 2022, Korea's honeybee population had declined by 16%. This decline is linked to the climate crisis, parasites, pesticides, and the loss of plants. In response, there is an urge for the formation of a government committee.

Bees have a long history, having evolved from carnivorous ancestors 100 million years ago. They possess five eyes and use dances to communicate and make decisions within the hive. The duties of worker bees are assigned based on their age, and their lifespans vary by season. Bees feed on nectar and pollen from honey plants, and the production of honey requires extensive foraging.
