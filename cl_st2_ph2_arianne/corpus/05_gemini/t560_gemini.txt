From a helicopter, the view over Siberia is of endless taiga turning into a charred landscape, all of it blanketed in thick smoke. Massive forest fires are raging across an area larger than the country of Belgium.

Hot, dry weather fuels new outbreaks daily, endangering nearby villages. The region’s wildlife, including sables, bears, deer, and elk, are also threatened by the flames. These fires create a dangerous feedback loop; they exacerbate climate change, and the changing climate, in turn, intensifies their spread. The majority of the fires, 90%, are human-caused and originate near logging sites and roads.

Despite the efforts of firefighters on the ground, the blazes are now beyond human control, and the smoke is affecting cities far from the front lines. Russian authorities are currently only tackling 9% of the total fire area, having deemed the effort to fight the rest too costly.
