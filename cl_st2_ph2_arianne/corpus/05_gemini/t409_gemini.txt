In São Gabriel da Cachoeira, which is Brazil's most Indigenous city, a Coping with COVID-19 Committee was formed to combat the pandemic. This committee included the city hall, Indigenous organizations such as FOIRN, FUNAI, ISA, DSEI, and the Army. Together, they implemented preventive measures that included communication in local languages, the creation of sanitary barriers, a lockdown, and the mandatory use of masks.

Despite these efforts, the community faced significant challenges, including the collapse of the healthcare system and high mortality rates among vulnerable Indigenous peoples. In response, Greenpeace and its partners provided support by delivering tests, oxygen, PPE, food, and equipment.

Furthermore, 12 field hospitals, known as UAPI, were established in the Rio Negro region to provide community-based treatment. This initiative, carried out with minimal federal support, aided in recoveries and helped preserve the knowledge of elders.
