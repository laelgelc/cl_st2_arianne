In the face of a climate emergency, while leaders fail to act, millions are demanding change. Over seven million people have joined street protests, with the last two Fridays marking the largest climate marches ever recorded.

These marches, led by students and school children, have spread from Wellington to Washington, taking place in about 4,000 locations worldwide. The events featured creative displays, showcasing masterpieces such as puppet oil CEOs and giant globes.

We will continue with weekly strikes until leaders heed the science. The next global strike is scheduled for November 29. Newcomers are welcomed, and all participants are urged to bring their friends.
