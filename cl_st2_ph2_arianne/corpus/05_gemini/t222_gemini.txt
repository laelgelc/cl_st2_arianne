Despite local opposition and the failures of COP26, South African Minister Gwede Mantashe has approved Shell's seismic survey for oil and gas off the Wild Coast. This decision comes as Shell's history in the Niger Delta is marked by oil spills, environmental damage, protests, and violence against local communities.

The proposed seismic blasting poses a threat to marine life, including southern right whales and coelacanths. It also endangers the livelihoods of indigenous communities who depend on fishing and ecotourism. These ocean ecosystems are vital for climate protection and are now at risk.

In response, Greenpeace and its partners are pursuing legal action, while protests continue across the nation. Communities such as Amadiba are resisting the project, citing the severe risks of oil spills and viewing the venture as a form of neo-colonial exploitation. They are urging for action to stop Shell.
