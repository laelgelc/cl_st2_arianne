On the 36th anniversary of the 1986 Chernobyl disaster, we are reminded of the catastrophic consequences of nuclear power. A safety test at reactor 4 resulted in an explosion that caused a massive radioactive release, contaminating Ukraine, Europe, and beyond. The disaster led to widespread evacuations, created areas that remain uninhabitable long-term, and incurred costs of around $700 billion.

Despite this legacy, the nuclear industry persists in promoting its technology as safe and green, engaging in ongoing obfuscation. This includes plans to have nuclear energy included in the EU taxonomy.

The risks are not a relic of the past. Today, parallels can be drawn to Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine. The seizure of the Chernobyl and Zaporizhzhia nuclear plants by Russian forces poses catastrophic risks to all of Ukraine's nuclear facilities.
