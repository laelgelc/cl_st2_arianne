Reflecting on five decades of activism, Rex Weyler shares the simple secret to organizing he learned from his mentor, Ira Sandperl: "Be organized." This principle is built on a foundation of seeking truth through relentless research, which means actively avoiding echo chambers and the pull of confirmation bias. To be effective, we must embrace a deep diversity of ideas.

This work requires practicing deep ecology to truly understand the intricate workings of nature. The solutions that emerge from this understanding should be localized, focusing on strengthening community ecosystems and fostering self-reliance. It is in these inclusive environments, open to a diversity of thought, that creativity can thrive.

We must also confront overshoot, the deeper crisis that goes beyond climate change. Addressing this requires a direct commitment to reduced consumption. To make this change possible, our communication must be effective. We can use powerful narratives to disrupt and challenge prevailing cultural myths.

Ultimately, this path involves personal growth. It calls for consistent self-examination and the discipline of quieting the ego to stay focused on the collective work ahead.
