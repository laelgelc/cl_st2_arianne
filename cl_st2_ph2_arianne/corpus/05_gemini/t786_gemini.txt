On Penguin Awareness Day, penguins were spotted waddling in diverse locations all over the world. They appeared ice skating in Stockholm, tap dancing in London, trekking in Turkey, and marching in Tokyo. They were even seen roaming the deserts of Israel and swimming in the Dead Sea.

This global journey was to support the creation of an Antarctic ocean sanctuary. Such a sanctuary would protect penguins, whales, and seals by barring industrial fishing vessels from their waters. These vessels harvest krill, which is an essential food source for life in the Antarctic.

Healthy oceans are crucial for everyone. They sustain wildlife, help to mitigate climate change, and ensure food security for billions of people. You are invited to join the movement to safeguard the penguins' home, allowing them to continue waddling forever.
