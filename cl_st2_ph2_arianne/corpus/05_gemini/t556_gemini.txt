Governments are currently at the United Nations in New York for the third round of negotiations on a Global Ocean Treaty. This treaty is crucial for the establishment of ocean sanctuaries, which are needed to protect marine life from climate change, pollution, overfishing, and destructive industries. The treaty could also enable the recovery of ocean habitats.

To counter industry lobbyists, nearly 1.8 million people have signed a petition that urges strong action from the negotiators. As part of a campaign in New York City, Greenpeace has occupied Times Square with displays featuring whales and turtles and has placed a giant whale sculpture at the entrance to the UN. The actor Javier Bardem has also delivered a speech to the negotiators, and personalized posters have been put up at their hotel.
