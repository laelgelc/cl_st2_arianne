We envision a world of durable, repairable electronics, which would save us money and reduce environmental impacts like resource extraction, the use of hazardous chemicals, energy use, and e-waste.

However, a Greenpeace-iFixit assessment of over 40 recent smartphones, tablets, and laptops shows trends that make repairs difficult. These trends include soldered components and fragile glass designs, such as on the Samsung S8. Batteries are hard to replace in devices like the Samsung Galaxy S8 and the Apple MacBook. Furthermore, proprietary tools are sometimes needed for repairs, for instance with the Apple iPhone.

While some brands offer repair-friendly products, most provide limited access to spare parts or manuals. Only Dell, Fairphone, and HP were found to provide full access. We urge brands like Apple and Samsung to design longer-lasting devices. We must rethink our electronics, and you can join the movement at rethink-it.org.
