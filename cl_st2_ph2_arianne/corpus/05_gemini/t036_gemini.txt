The fossil fuel industry has been engaged in unlawful activities for decades, including spreading lies about the climate crisis. There are 26 examples of credibly alleged or proven crimes committed by Europe-based companies such as Shell, TotalEnergies, and Equinor.

Corruption stands out as the most recurrent offense, alongside an emerging trend of greenwashing. The impacts of these activities are severe, particularly in the Global South, with examples in Nigeria and Sudan. By driving one-third of global emissions, the industry exacerbates climate disasters like the floods in Pakistan and typhoons in the Philippines.

To end these crimes, Greenpeace calls for a halt to all new fossil fuel projects. We must demand accountability for the industry and fight for climate justice.
