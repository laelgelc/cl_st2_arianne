From aboard the Greenpeace ship Arctic Sunrise in the North Sea, oil campaigner Sarah North has shared the story of her unexpected journey. She initially travelled from London to Scotland simply to walk her dog, a trip that ultimately led to her involvement in protesting a BP oil rig.

For ten days, activists have occupied the rig located in Cromarty Firth. Their action has repeatedly forced the rig to turn back, preventing BP from proceeding with its drilling plans. This is BP's only new rig for this year, and it is intended to extract 30 million barrels of oil at a time of climate crisis.

Sarah expressed her pride in the team and voiced her hope that this protest might be the catalyst that pushes BP to abandon its plans for oil drilling.
