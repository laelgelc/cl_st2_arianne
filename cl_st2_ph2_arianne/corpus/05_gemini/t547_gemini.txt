Since 2013, BP has pursued oil drilling plans in the Amazon Reef region, making decisions without considering the negative consequences. In response, Greenpeace has documented whale migration and breeding in the area. This work includes capturing the first-ever underwater footage of a Bryde’s Rorqual in French Guiana.

Our expeditions have also recorded sightings of sailfishes, spotted dolphins, false killer whales, pygmy killer whales, silky sharks, and Melon head dolphins. This evidence demonstrates the ecosystem's diversity. Despite proof of the reef's extent and vulnerability, BP persists with its plans. This persistence continues even after Brazil's environmental agency, IBAMA, denied the company a license in 2018, citing the significant risks of an oil spill.

To safeguard this unique and diverse ecosystem, we are calling for a Global Ocean Treaty. BP must withdraw its plans from the Amazon Reef, and decisive action must be taken to ensure its protection.
