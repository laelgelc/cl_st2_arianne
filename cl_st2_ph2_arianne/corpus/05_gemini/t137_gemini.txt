Climate catastrophes and the pandemic serve to expose existing structural inequalities. In response, sectors like agriculture and energy must be subject to stringent regulation. This regulation should be founded on human rights, environmental assessments, and the consent of women and Indigenous Peoples.

Amid these crises, wealthy nations and corporations have been profiteering. This situation calls for alternatives to the current capitalist system. We must embrace diverse visions that move beyond GDP as a measure of success and instead prioritize wellbeing. One such model is the Economy for the Common Good matrix.

To achieve this, we must divest from fossil fuels and military systems. It is also necessary to recognize care work as a form of green job. Power must be redistributed away from corporations, and this can be accomplished through accountability measures, such as a binding international treaty.
