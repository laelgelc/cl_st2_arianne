The extreme wildfires and storms of 2017 were visceral effects of global heating, potentially marking a milestone in public awareness of the climate crisis.

Fueled by heat waves and droughts, record-breaking fires occurred in Russia, China, Mongolia, North America, and Europe. These fires led to widespread destruction, deaths, and evacuations.

Simultaneously, storms were intensified by warmer oceans. Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Maria, and Ophelia set records for both energy and damages in the United States and Europe.

These events are a warning of non-linear escalations that can occur with rising temperatures. Historically, climate science has failed to curb emissions. To address this, action is urged through a framework of "seven megatrends."
