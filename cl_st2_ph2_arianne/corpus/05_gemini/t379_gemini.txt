Taiwan's coral reefs, which are home to one-third of the world's species, are a major attraction for divers. However, they are facing significant damage from the impacts of climate change and pollution. Rising ocean temperatures have caused repeated coral bleaching events, which occurred in 2014, 2016, 2017, 2019, and again this year.

Shrimp Roll, a former Greenpeace fundraiser who is now a diving instructor on Green Island, has witnessed the massive scale of this bleaching. He describes the process where symbiotic algae abandon the corals, leaving behind only their skeletons. He notes that recovery from these events is challenging.

One of the direct impacts he has observed is the rise in winter ocean temperatures, which are now 23-24°C compared to their former 19-20°C. To protect these marine ecosystems, he urges people to reduce trash, phase out the use of fossil fuels, and support climate policies.
