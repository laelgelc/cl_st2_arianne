In Russia's Bashkortostan, the sacred Shihan Kushtau is facing a significant threat. This unique limestone mountain, home to rare species, is targeted for mining by the Bashkir Soda Company. The company intends to use the mountain's limestone for an outdated method of soda production.

In response, local activists have organized to protect the mountain. They formed camps and created human chains to stand against tree cutting and the installation of fencing. On August 15, police conducted a raid on the activists' camp. During this raid, protesters were beaten, 80 individuals were detained, and equipment belonging to journalists was damaged.

Despite the violence and the use of misinformation against them, the protests have led to a development. The head of the republic has promised to halt the company's activities to open a path for dialogue.

Greenpeace Russia has taken action by filing complaints. The organization is demanding that Kushtau be given protected status, that the detained activists be released, and that the Bashkir Soda Company transitions to sustainable production technologies.
