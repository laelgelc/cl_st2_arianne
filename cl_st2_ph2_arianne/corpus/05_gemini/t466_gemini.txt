The COVID-19 crisis provides lessons for how we must address the climate emergency. The choices we make as we move forward from the pandemic will shape our society, economy, health, and climate. We face a warning that polluters may ramp up their emissions in the aftermath.

Instead, we must urge that financial aid be used for a just, green transition. This transition should focus on investing in quality jobs, public services, and equity for all. It calls for fundamental shifts in our approach, moving toward compassion and cooperation to build resilience against crises, including those related to health, the climate, and inequality.

While there have been short-term drops in emissions, it is critical to recognize these will be temporary without systemic action. The crises we face must be tackled together, and we cannot allow efforts to recover from one crisis to undermine our vital environmental work.
