Immediate climate action is urgently needed at COP26 to keep the Paris Agreement's 1.5C goal within reach. The current national emission plans are insufficient, putting the world on a trajectory for 2.7C of warming. Against this backdrop, people power, demonstrated through activism and legal wins, is creating a powerful force for change.

Greenpeace demands a halt to all new fossil fuel projects and a phase-out of the industry, accompanied by just transitions. We need ambitious national plans to halve emissions by 2030 and achieve net zero by 2050, with rich nations leading the way. Cooperation rules must be equitable and reject the use of carbon offsets, which are scams. Additionally, the commitment to provide $100 billion in annual climate finance for vulnerable countries must be fulfilled. This funding is essential for supporting clean energy, adapting to climate impacts, and compensating for loss and damage.
