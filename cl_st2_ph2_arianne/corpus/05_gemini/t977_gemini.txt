Everyday wood surfaces may come from illegal logging in the Democratic Republic of Congo's Congo Basin forests. Rampant illegal practices in this region destroy environments and livelihoods.

Greenpeace has traced a shipment of endangered Wengé wood that was felled illegally by the Bakri Bois Corporation. This wood was transported via the Congo River to Antwerp, where it was sold to Bois d’Afrique Mondiale. From there, it was processed at a facility in the Czech Republic belonging to the Danzer Group. The Danzer Group was recently disassociated from the Forest Stewardship Council due to human rights violations.

While the European Union's 2013 Timber Regulation prohibits the entry of illegal timber, its enforcement is weak. To protect the Congo Basin forests and the communities that depend on them, Greenpeace is urging authorities to carry out investigations and seize illegal timber shipments.
