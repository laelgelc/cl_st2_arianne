In Brazil, Indigenous Peoples are demanding an end to the destruction of the Amazon and the violence directed at forest guardians. Over 5,000 leaders from 120 different groups have gathered in Brasilia for the 18th Free Land Camp. For 10 days, they are holding non-violent protests under the theme "Retaking Brazil: Demarcating Territories and Indigenize the Politics."

Their central calls are for the immediate demarcation of their lands and for issues like health and education to be addressed. The leaders are denouncing significant threats, including ongoing deforestation and the expansion of mining. They specifically pointed to legislative threats such as bill PL 191/2020 and the collection of proposals known as the #PacotedaDestruição.

This protest comes at a time of rising murders and invasions of their lands, according to data from CIMI. As a powerful symbol of their demands, a petition with 517,000 signatures was delivered to the Ministry of Justice. The petition was represented by a totem pole adorned with ribbons.
