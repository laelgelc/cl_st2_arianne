It began with a single student's act of courage, an act that sparked the global school strikes movement. This movement has since grown into one of the largest climate actions worldwide.

Young people are protesting in an incredible range of countries, including Vietnam, Kenya, Russia, Kosovo, the Solomon Islands, Canada, the Seychelles, Pakistan, Antarctica, Afghanistan, and Bangladesh. Students are bravely demonstrating in cities like Kabul, Moscow, Karachi, and Ho Chi Minh, producing iconic images of their fight. With each strike, the movement continues to expand to new locations.

This is a tribute to these heroes who are standing up amid the climate emergency. Their actions should urge all of us to fight for a better planet for future generations.
