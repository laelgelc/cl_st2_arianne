The awareness of humanity's impact on the planet is an ancient concern, not a modern one. Early warnings against ecological harm can be traced back to Vedic hymns, Taoist principles, and Mesopotamian epics. This thread of consciousness continued through history, with notable concerns about pollution arising during medieval times.

The 18th and 19th centuries saw key figures advance the principles of ecology and conservation. Thinkers like Benjamin Franklin, Henry David Thoreau, and Ernst Haeckel laid important groundwork for the movements to come. The 20th century, however, marked a series of crucial milestones in environmental history. Rachel Carson’s book *Silent Spring* served as a major catalyst, alongside the rise of anti-nuclear campaigns and the powerful grassroots Chipko movement.

It was within this context of growing global action that Greenpeace was founded in 1969. The journey continued with iconic symbols like the Rainbow Warrior, yet the work is far from over. We continue to face ongoing global environmental challenges today.
