A global sand crisis is being driven by urban expansion and the demands of construction, which lead to the extraction of billions of tonnes of sand annually from rivers, lakes, and oceans. This extraction causes significant environmental harm, including habitat destruction, erosion, and saltwater intrusion. It also contributes to the decline of species such as dolphins, turtles, porpoises, and birds, and creates conditions for disease breeding.

The impacts are felt by communities globally. Fishing communities have suffered losses in regions including Cambodia, Vietnam, China, Africa, Mozambique, and India. The crisis has also led to infrastructure failures, such as bridge collapses, and is associated with illegal mining and trade. Projections indicate that sand use is set to double by 2060, which will only worsen this pattern of unsustainable development, a situation comparable to over-fishing.
