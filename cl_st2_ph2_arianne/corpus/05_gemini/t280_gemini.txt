Driven by pacifist ideals influenced by Gandhi and the Quakers, Irving and Dorothy Stowe fled the United States in opposition to the Vietnam War and nuclear testing. They settled in Vancouver, where they began organizing anti-war and ecological campaigns.

To protest US nuclear tests on Amchitka Island, they formed the Don’t Make A Wave Committee. A suggestion to sail a boat into the test zone inspired a new course of action. The committee raised funds through concerts and chartered a boat, the Phyllis Cormack, which they renamed Greenpeace.

The 1971 voyage did not stop the nuclear blast, but it successfully galvanized global opposition to the testing program. This widespread pressure led to the program's cancellation. Following this campaign, the Greenpeace Foundation was founded.
