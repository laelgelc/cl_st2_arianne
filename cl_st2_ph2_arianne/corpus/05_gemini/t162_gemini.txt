Russia's war in Ukraine is intensifying a global food crisis, causing soaring prices and shortages in a way that is similar to past events. This situation highlights a broken food system dominated by corporations. These corporations destroy habitats to grow animal feed and biofuels, which leads to deforestation and the loss of biodiversity. They also engage in profiteering through market speculation.

Governments must take action to fix this system. They should regulate commodities trading and impose windfall taxes. Investment is needed in agroecology and support for small farmers. It is crucial to end land use changes and move towards localizing food production.

To achieve food security and uphold food rights, we must protect ecosystems and ensure the equitable distribution of resources. Individuals can also play a part by making choices such as eating local and seasonal foods.
