As Australia endures unprecedented bushfires, a flood of misinformation is seeking to blame arsonists or green policies instead of the real culprit: climate change. It is crucial to set the record straight.

These devastating fires are the result of Australia’s hottest and driest year on record. The immediate causes have been varied, including dry lightning strikes and accidents, but the claim of widespread arson is false. In fact, only about 1% of the fires were deliberately lit. This false narrative has been amplified by a coordinated disinformation campaign using bots to spread lies.

Similarly, claims that environmentalists have prevented fire control measures have been debunked. While these dangerous myths circulate, people in cities are suffering the effects of toxic haze blanketing their communities.

The time to discuss climate change is now. We cannot allow disinformation to distract from the failure of politicians to act on the climate crisis. While the country burns, Australia remains a massive exporter of coal, fuelling the very emergency that is causing so much destruction.
