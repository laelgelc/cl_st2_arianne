This week, from Colombia to Hong Kong and from Canada to Switzerland, Greenpeace activists protested retailers worldwide. Through demonstrations, in-store protests, and the delivery of petitions, they demanded an end to single-use plastics. The core message emphasized that for throwaway items, there is no “away.”

These actions are part of the Reuse Revolution, a movement of people across the globe who are replacing single-use plastics with reusable alternatives. More than 5 million people are part of this call, urging companies and governments to act against plastic pollution.

Instead of real change, companies are offering false solutions such as paper or bioplastics, alongside flawed recycling systems. The solution requires retailers to remove single-use plastics and make a firm commitment to investing in refill and reuse systems. They must also drive this change forward with the brands they stock.
