On May 29, a diesel oil tank at the Nadezhda plant on Russia's Taymyr peninsula burst, spilling over 20,000 tonnes into local waterways. The spill has contaminated 20km and turned the Ambarnaya River red as it flows toward the sea.

This major Arctic spill, operated by a Nornickel division in polluted Norilsk, was discovered late via media, which prompted anger from Putin and the declaration of a state of emergency. Greenpeace estimates the damages exceed RUB 10 billion. We note that companies often evade liability and exploit the Covid crisis to weaken environmental laws.

This event highlights the risks of fossil fuels in the Arctic. We are urging for government audits, frequent inspections, and a green recovery package to support a just transition from oil.
