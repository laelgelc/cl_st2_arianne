I recently witnessed the severe flood damage at Hangang Park following the wettest monsoon season on record. This disaster caused 42 casualties, created over 8,000 victims, and led to landslides and agricultural losses.

This is a glimpse of our future. A Greenpeace analysis predicts that due to climate change-induced sea level rise and more frequent storms, there could be 3.3 million flood victims by 2030.

We are urging the Korean government to declare a climate emergency. It is critical that they commit to halving emissions by 2030 and achieving net-zero by 2050. Change is possible, as demonstrated by corporate commitments from companies like Apple and global efforts like the EU Green Deal.

There is hope in our collective action. We call for public involvement to address this crisis together.
