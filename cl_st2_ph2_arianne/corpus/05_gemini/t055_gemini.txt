In 2013, as Yeb Saño attended COP19, Super Typhoon Haiyan was devastating the Philippines. While his brother survived the storm, thousands of others died. As a parent, he fears the escalating climate disasters fueled by fossil fuels.

He criticises Shell for its massive carbon pollution, which is ten times that of the Philippines. In 2022, the company's record profits were greater than the costs to clean up the floods in Pakistan. Saño demands that Shell pay for the loss and damage it has caused. An agreement to create a loss and damage fund was made at COP27.

To halt extraction and enforce accountability for global climate harm, Saño joined Greenpeace activists to protest at Shell's North Sea oil platform.
