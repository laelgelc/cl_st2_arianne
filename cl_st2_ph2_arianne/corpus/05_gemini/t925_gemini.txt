As part of the Detox Outdoor campaign, Greenpeace surveyed major outdoor brands about their use of PFCs, revealing widespread chemical contamination in their products.

Over 30,000 people voted to help select 40 items for testing. Of those tested, PFCs were detected in all but four products. Notably, high levels of hazardous long-chain PFCs and PFOA were found in gear from The North Face and Mammut.

These persistent chemicals are known to pollute remote natural areas. They can enter food chains, affecting both wildlife and humans.

In a positive step, UK brand Páramo has committed to Detox and has now eliminated PFCs entirely from its production. It joins 34 other brands that have also made a Detox commitment.

The outdoor community is now urged to call on brands like Mammut and The North Face to stop using toxic chemicals and to protect the natural environments they claim to love.
