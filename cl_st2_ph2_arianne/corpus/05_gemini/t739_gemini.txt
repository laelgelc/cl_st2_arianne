Activists, highlighted by Greenpeace, are protesting Mitsubishi UFJ for its role in funding new coal projects, a decision that stands in contrast to the bank's simultaneous investments in renewables. This situation urges us all to investigate where our own money is invested, from our banks and pensions to our insurance providers.

We have the power to help shift toward a low-carbon economy, a sector that offers $89 trillion in opportunities and where clean energy investments are outperforming fossil fuels. The financial system is often opaque, but we can take action. Using sustainable indexes to guide our investments and engaging in shareholder activism are effective ways to make a change. Greenpeace supports global activists who are leading these efforts.

Demands for transparency in the financial sector are growing. While an estimated $5 trillion is still invested in fossil fuels, a significant shift is already happening. To date, 884 institutions, representing a combined worth of $6 trillion, have divested from coal. This movement is essential to enable a transition to clean energy for all.
