Thanks to the Save the Arctic campaign, governments have agreed to protect a vast area of the Arctic Ocean from commercial fishing for at least 16 years. This area is roughly the size of the Mediterranean Sea and the agreement bolsters efforts for long-term safeguards against destructive fishing and fossil fuels.

Meanwhile, a sanctuary in the Antarctic’s Ross Sea takes effect today. This sanctuary, which is twice the size of Spain, will be shielded from extractive industries. These wins are a benefit to polar wildlife and the health of our global oceans, and they demonstrate the impact of people power.

Drawing from the protections won for the Antarctic in the 1980s, we must now create a massive Antarctic Ocean Sanctuary. This will safeguard penguins, whales, and seals, and protect the krill they feed on from industrial fishing.
