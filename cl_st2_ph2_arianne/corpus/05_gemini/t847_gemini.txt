The global water crisis is considered the top risk, driven by pollution from bacteria, toxins, and nutrient loading. A solution to this is bioremediation, which uses natural systems like plants, microbes, and fungi to clean contaminated water and soil. This practice has historical examples from farming and permaculture.

A related concept is biomimicry, where innovations are inspired by nature, such as Velcro. However, biomimicry is sometimes critiqued for its neoliberal applications that prioritize profit over restoration.

Case studies in bioremediation include the planting of cattails at Lake Winnipeg, John Todd's Living Machines, and Paul Stamets' mycofiltration. The ecological rehabilitation of the Loess Plateau also serves as an example. These approaches emphasize natural economics and the concept of planetary boundaries.
