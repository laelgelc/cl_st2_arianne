Parit Chomchuen, a transman and activist at Greenpeace Thailand, has shared his experiences during Pride Month, highlighting the internal and external pressures that transgender people face. He describes societal gender norms as a restrictive "box" that creates internalized struggles. This "box" prompts questions about masculinity, appearance, hormonal therapy, and surgery.

When a person breaks free from these norms, they can incur stigma, discrimination, and transphobia. These pressures have an impact on mental health, contributing to issues like higher rates of depression.

Parit urges for the removal of fixed gender beliefs and the fostering of welcoming environments. He also calls for organizations to support queer rights. He connects his activism for the queer community to Greenpeace's environmental campaigns, emphasizing that injustice is universal. This connection is highlighted through the Global Rainbow Network.
