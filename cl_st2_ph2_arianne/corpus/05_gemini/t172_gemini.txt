Fossil fuel companies are using advertisements and sponsorships to obstruct climate action, employing tactics that echo those used by the tobacco industry.

In response, 450 scientists have urged advertising and public relations firms to drop their fossil fuel clients. The IPCC report has also criticised corporate lobbying and advertising, recommending that such activities be regulated. Furthermore, over 500 academics are demanding that universities reject research funding from the fossil fuel industry as a measure to combat greenwashing. An example of the industry's influence is Gazprom's football sponsorship, which continued amid the invasion of Ukraine.

To counter this, Greenpeace, together with 36 other organisations, has launched a European Citizens’ Initiative. This initiative calls for a tobacco-style ban on fossil fuel advertisements and sponsorships. To compel the European Union to discuss the proposal, the campaign needs to collect 1 million signatures by October 2022. This action aims to dismantle the industry's influence in order to secure peace and protect the climate.
