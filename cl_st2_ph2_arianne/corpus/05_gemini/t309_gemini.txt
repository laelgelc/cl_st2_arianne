Amid easing Covid restrictions, and in alignment with World Bicycle Day and World Environment Day, we can promote eco-friendly urban mobility. We encourage everyone to #ShareTheCity by opting for trains over short-haul flights and cars. Using shared electric vehicles and reducing private car use helps to cut emissions and free up space for people and nature.

We urge governments to prioritize walking, cycling, public transport, and green spaces. We also advocate for community organizing to create car-free zones and safer infrastructure. Greenpeace's #Mobility4All campaign seeks accessible, sustainable transport for all. Biking, walking, and using rail offer benefits for our health, social connection, and environmental protection.
