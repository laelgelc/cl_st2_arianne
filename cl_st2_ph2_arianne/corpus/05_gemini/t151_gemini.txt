This summer in India, the heat has been unbearable. A roadside vendor in Delhi described a recent day as the worst this year. It is the poor, people like daily wagers and vendors, who are disproportionately affected by this extreme weather.

Climate change worsens inequality globally. The impacts are being felt everywhere. India experienced a record-hot March heatwave with low rainfall. In Brazil, floods have killed 106 people. In Assam, India, 700,000 people have been affected by floods, and there has been deadly destruction in South Africa's KwaZulu-Natal.

Meanwhile, governments are accepting extreme weather as the new normal. World leaders must commit to ambitious climate and social equity actions.
