We recommend a number of environmental films and documentaries, starting with the satirical "Don't Look Up." This film serves as an allegory for the climate crisis, depicting a comet threat and the experience of scientists being ignored, a theme that resonated with Greenpeace co-founder Rex Weyler.

Other recommendations include a documentary that debunks myths about meat, featuring Arnold Schwarzenegger, and "Sexy Killer," which exposes scandals within Indonesia's coal industry. There is also a film focusing on coral bleaching in Australia and another that follows Leonardo DiCaprio on his global journey to learn about the climate. For those interested in our history, there is a film that tells the story of Greenpeace's founding.

The film "Parasite" is included for its exploration of inequality and its connection to climate impacts. Further recommendations cover Sylvia Earle's ocean advocacy, a minimalism documentary that promotes consuming less, and a film sharing the stories of Brazilians who have been affected by climate change.

We invite you to share your own favorite films on these topics.
