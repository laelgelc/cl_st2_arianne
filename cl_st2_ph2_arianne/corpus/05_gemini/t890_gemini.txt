The Greenpeace ship, Arctic Sunrise, has carried the voices of eight million people to the Arctic. These messages urge for the region's protection from oil drilling and destructive fishing.

To amplify these voices, renowned pianist Ludovico Einaudi journeyed with us to Svalbard. There, amid the ice and in front of a glacier, he composed and performed a piece titled "Elegy for the Arctic." This action was timed to coincide with the OSPAR Commission meeting taking place in Tenerife. The event is in support of a proposal to safeguard 10% of the Arctic Ocean.

The urgency for this protection is heightened by melting ice. However, the proposal faces opposition from Norway, Denmark, and Iceland, who are influenced by corporate interests. Protection is critical for several reasons: the Arctic is home to unique wildlife, it plays a role in climate regulation, it must be preserved for future generations, and it needs to be guarded against greed.
