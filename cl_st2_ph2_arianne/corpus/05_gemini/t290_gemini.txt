Vital Ocean Voices features stories from coastal communities in the Indian Ocean, focusing on the impacts of destructive fishing, pollution, and climate breakdown. This post shares the experience of Kokoly, a respected octopus gleaner from the Vezo seafaring people in Madagascar whose livelihood is dependent on the sea.

Living in extreme poverty, Kokoly describes the decline in marine resources caused by overfishing and habitat destruction. She notes that there are fewer fish and sharks compared to her youth. These issues affect Vezo communities broadly, yet they are often overlooked in global discussions. The film highlights the perspectives of women on their struggles for survival.
