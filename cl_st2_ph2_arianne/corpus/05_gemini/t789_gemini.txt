Penguins have been sighted worldwide as part of a new Greenpeace campaign, appearing on trains, at airports, and at landmarks in cities like Sydney, Buenos Aires, London, and Johannesburg. The initiative is calling for the creation of a 1.8 million square kilometer Antarctic Ocean Sanctuary.

This sanctuary would protect penguins, whales, and seals by excluding industrial krill fishing, limiting the impacts of climate change, and ensuring the health of the ocean.

A key opportunity is approaching, as the Antarctic Ocean Commission will discuss the proposal in October. People are urged to demand action from their leaders and can join the campaign at protecttheantarctic.org.
