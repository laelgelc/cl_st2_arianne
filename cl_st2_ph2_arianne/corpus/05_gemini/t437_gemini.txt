The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated food insecurity, which was already being fueled by inequality and the climate crisis. This convergence of crises is creating disruptions that risk affecting billions of people.

At the heart of the problem is a broken industrial food system. This system, driven by corporate interests, is fundamentally flawed, leading to a situation where vast amounts of food are wasted while millions of people go hungry.

To fix this, we must embrace food justice and food sovereignty. This means valuing our essential food workers and implementing supportive social measures, such as a universal basic income. Policies must be redirected to build ecological resilience.

There are practical actions we can all take. We can reduce our food waste and shift towards more plant-based and local diets. We can also support initiatives like urban agriculture and community-supported farming.

Governments have a critical role to play. They must begin to treat food as a common good, not just a commodity, and provide the necessary funding to support the transition to a more just and sustainable system. Cities like Victoria, Canada, are already showing a way forward with their food-growing initiatives.
