In Indonesia, the destructive impact of greedy palm oil companies is causing burning rainforests, species loss, and the displacement of communities. As this industry expands into Papua, it now threatens the region's spectacular Birds of Paradise.

There are around 40 species of these birds, known for their stunning beauty and unique behaviors. To highlight the threat they face, street artists and volunteers worldwide are creating urban murals. These artworks depict the birds' incredible plumage, their dances, and their distinct traits, all to raise awareness of the threats to Indonesian wildlife and to inspire action.

Artists, students, bird enthusiasts, and consumers are urged to join the #WingsOfParadise movement. You can take part by admiring the artworks, sharing them, and discussing the importance of forest protection.
