End-of-year consumption spikes, such as those seen during Black Friday, Singles Day, and Cyber Monday, are driven by low prices that do not account for their environmental costs. With 55% of the world's population currently living in cities, a figure expected to rise to 70% by 2050, urban consumption is a major factor, causing 70% of global greenhouse gas emissions.

In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, governments are promoting consumerism and boosting e-commerce as part of their recovery efforts. The solution is to consume less and better, which requires analyzing our purchases to reduce the high-carbon impacts associated with production, shipping, and packaging. Cities can contribute by taking actions such as banning advertisements, promoting repair cafes, and encouraging reuse and sharing. Furthermore, e-commerce companies must be held accountable for adopting sustainable practices.
