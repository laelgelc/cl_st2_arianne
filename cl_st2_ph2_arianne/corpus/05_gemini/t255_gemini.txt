Despite an abundance of food globally, the industrial agriculture system exacerbates hunger, health issues, and environmental damage. This is driven by poverty, inequality, and the pursuit of corporate profit.

There is a myth that industrial farming can solve world hunger, but this system treats food as a commodity, not a right. It is also incredibly inefficient, using 26% of the planet's land to grow feed for livestock. The environmental toll is immense, with industrial agriculture contributing 19% of global greenhouse gas emissions and causing 80% of all deforestation.

This system also impacts our health, making safe, organic food a luxury for the few. The pesticides used in industrial farming are linked to serious diseases, including cancer.

To create a sustainable food system, we must reduce meat consumption and give our support to Indigenous and small-scale farmers. It is critical to halt deforestation and demand that our leaders regulate corporations.
