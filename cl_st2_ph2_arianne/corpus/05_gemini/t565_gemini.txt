On 31 July, activists from the Philippines to New Zealand placed posters and street art in public spaces across 25 cities. The purpose of this peaceful People vs. Oil solidarity action was to hold the oil industry accountable for the climate crisis.

The images depicted intensified forest fires, hurricanes, cyclones, rainfall, and extreme temperatures. The art proclaimed that climate anxiety, breakdown, and grief are "proudly brought to you" by the fossil fuel industry. This was designed to counter the misleading advertisements of oil companies. The posters and street art also included calls for people to join the fight, announcing the end of the oil age.
