Industrial fishing is decimating ocean life. It is destroying seabeds, harming wildlife, and threatening food security for coastal communities around the world.

This week, the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission failed to agree on conservation measures for overfished yellowfin tuna. This failure was a direct result of the EU and industrial fishing interests from France and Spain, who blocked the agreement to prioritize their profits.

This decision allows the continued exploitation of our oceans, pushing yellowfin tuna populations towards a potential collapse by 2024. This not only threatens the tuna but also sharks and entire marine ecosystems. It directly harms the livelihoods of small-scale fishers in places like Mauritius and Seychelles.

The scale of this crisis is immense. Only 1% of the world's oceans are protected, while 93% of fish populations are now overfished. A strong Global Ocean Treaty is desperately needed to create a network of ocean sanctuaries where marine life can recover. Join the calls to pressure governments to protect our oceans.
