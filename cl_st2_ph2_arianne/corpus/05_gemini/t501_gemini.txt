Amid widespread demonstrations, personal accounts from protesters around the world reveal a unified demand for climate and social justice.

In Chile, activists are fighting against inequality, the privatization of resources, and police violence. Their goal is a new constitution that prioritizes human dignity and the protection of the environment.

A protester in Russia, who was inspired by Greta Thunberg, began by holding solo strikes. Despite the risks, this individual has since built a movement, emphasizing the importance of scientific unity.

From Uganda, voices connect their protests to a sense of religious duty. They are seeking systemic change, a transition to renewable energy, and for leaders to declare a climate emergency.

Across these movements, protesters express feelings of hope and empowerment. They also share frustration with unresponsive leaders. A common thread is the determination to unite against greed and the ongoing planetary crisis.
