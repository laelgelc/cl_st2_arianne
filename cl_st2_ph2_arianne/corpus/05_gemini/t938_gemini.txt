Our reliance on synthetic pesticides is causing devastating environmental impacts across Europe. This chemical addiction is driving ecosystem collapse and a catastrophic loss of biodiversity, with 24% of species in the EU now threatened. Essential natural services that we all depend on, such as pollination and the maintenance of soil fertility, are being severely disrupted.

Despite the existence of regulations, pesticides continue to pose unacceptable risks. Our latest report exposes critical gaps in the system designed to protect us and our environment. For instance, approvals often rely on modeling rather than data from real-world field conditions. Furthermore, the testing process is frequently led by the pesticide industry itself and typically focuses only on the active ingredients, ignoring the full impact of the chemical cocktail being used.

We must shift away from this destructive model and embrace ecological farming. This approach combines modern science with a profound respect for nature, placing control over our food systems back into the hands of local communities. To make this vision a reality, we must redirect subsidies to support farmers in this transition. It is time to break the pesticide cycle and champion a future of chemical-free agriculture.
