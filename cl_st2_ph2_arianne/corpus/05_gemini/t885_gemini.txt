Aboard the Greenpeace ship Arctic Sunrise, Captain Mike Fincken transported a Steinway baby grand piano on a journey northward from Germany. The vessel endured a storm off the coast of Norway, and temperatures dropped as it crossed the Arctic Circle.

In Longyearbyen, composer Ludovico Einaudi joined the ship. From there, they navigated to the Wahlenbergbreen glacier in Yoldiabukta Bay, anchoring near the ice wall.

On a floating stage, Einaudi performed his composition, "Elegy to the Arctic." His music was accompanied by the sounds of melting ice and collapsing cliffs from the glacier, a performance that evoked deep emotion. He played for the Arctic birds, for the crew, for the 8 million supporters of Save The Arctic, and for future generations. The performance was also for Captain Fincken's son on his fourth birthday.
