From the deck of the Greenpeace ship Esperanza, I’ve been sailing through the nutrient-rich Atlantic waters of West Africa. It is a place of incredible life. We have encountered whales and dolphins, watched pelicans and gannets dive for food, and seen flying fish skim the waves. At night, the water comes alive with the glow of bioluminescent plankton.

Our mission here is to chase illegal fishing vessels, and we have witnessed the devastation caused by overfishing. Yet, amidst this, it is the beauty of nature that provides hope. Below the surface, we have seen coral reefs that are home to moray eels and lobsters. These ecosystems are fed by the natural upwelling of nutrients from the deep.

Onshore, the mangroves serve as vital carbon sinks, and the beaches are essential for endangered green sea turtles to lay their eggs. On remote islands, we have found marine hippos and manatees. We’ve also met communities living in symbiosis with nature, their lives vibrant with colourful attire, pirogues, and music.

This region is a treasure. To protect it, we must ensure its resources are managed correctly. Please join us and sign the petition for sustainable fisheries management.
