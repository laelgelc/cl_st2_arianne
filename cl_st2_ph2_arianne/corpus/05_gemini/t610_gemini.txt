Greenpeace and our network of over three million supporters are actively campaigning against corporate plastic pollution, with a focus on companies like Nestlé and Unilever.

During a Global Week of Action, activists delivered plastic monsters to Nestlé's headquarters in Switzerland and to its offices worldwide. These actions demanded that the company reduce its plastic production and invest in reuse models. Similar protests targeted Unilever in the Netherlands.

To highlight the impact of this pollution on communities and nature, Greenpeace ships transported pollution symbols from Southeast Asia to Europe.

In response, Nestlé has acknowledged that recycling is not enough and has pledged to cut its use of single-use plastics. However, Greenpeace is urging the company to provide transparent plans and set ambitious targets that are needed to end the crisis.
