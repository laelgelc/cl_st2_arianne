On this International Day of Forests, we are campaigning for the protection of the world’s forests, which are vital for sustaining life.

Forests absorb and store nearly 300 billion tonnes of carbon, yet deforestation is responsible for 12% of global greenhouse gas emissions. The impact on biodiversity is severe, with extinction rates having surged up to a thousand times in recent centuries. Without action, these rates could rise even further.

Our health is also deeply connected to forest ecosystems. Tropical rainforests are home to 70% of plants known to have anti-cancer properties and provide the source for about a quarter of the drugs used in conventional medicine.

Corporations like Procter & Gamble must take responsibility and address the forest destruction in their supply chains. We also need governments to enforce protections for these critical habitats. People are raising their voices to demand action; over 10,000 are using #StandForForests to advocate for their protection.
