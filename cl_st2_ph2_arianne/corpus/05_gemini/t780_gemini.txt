Our report, "Justice for People and Planet," details 20 case studies that highlight corporate abuses of human and environmental rights. These cases cover issues such as deforestation, pollution, and violations of Indigenous rights.

The report attributes these abuses to significant governance gaps in global economic rules. These gaps are not accidental; they are enabled by political choices and the corporate capture of institutions. To address this, we have proposed 10 Principles for Corporate Accountability. The core of these principles is the need to put people and the environment ahead of corporations. They advocate for binding rules, mandatory due diligence, transparency, and clear liability for corporations. Furthermore, the principles call for guaranteed access to remedy for victims and effective enforcement.

There are positive examples showing that change is possible. These include France's laws on risk prevention, a referendum that took place in Switzerland, and the UK's Modern Slavery Act. While Greenpeace's work involves exposing misdeeds, we also praise positive corporate actions and are focused on offering alternatives.
