Amid Spain's economic crisis, Valencia is showing a powerful way forward. A commitment has been made to double the land used for organic farming from 8% to 20% by 2020, with 23 million Euros in backing. This is a crucial step in a country where high pesticide use is harming bees.

This change is part of a bigger picture. Globally, the demand for ecological food is on the rise, and farmers are increasingly shifting away from industrial systems. A burgeoning movement, complete with markets and co-ops, is growing.

We urge governments to invest in ecological agriculture. It is a solution that helps combat climate change, pollution, biodiversity loss, and hunger. We also call on individuals to join this movement by pledging their support for better food.
