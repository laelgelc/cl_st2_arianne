Two-thirds of our oceans are considered international waters, where a lack of strong protection means exploitation is prioritized over conservation. The Central Arctic Ocean is a key area of concern, as it is warming twice as fast as the global average. Its sea ice is melting rapidly, and we could see ice-free summers there by 2030. This is revealing a new ocean, which is teeming with vulnerable marine life.

Greenpeace is advocating for the creation of a sanctuary in the Central Arctic Ocean. This sanctuary would ban extractive activities such as fishing, mining, and oil drilling. A proposed UN treaty provides an opportunity to make this happen. Our organization has been monitoring the recent UN discussions to ensure the outcome is robust protection for our oceans. We are urging action to create a lasting protected legacy. The UN chair is aiming for an agreement to be reached by 2019.
