Illegal gold mining is destroying the rich biodiversity of the Brazilian Amazon. The practice pollutes rivers with mercury and sediments, which reduces the amount of sunlight penetrating the water. This, in turn, disrupts the ability of fish to hunt and respire, and also affects their spawning in headwaters. The use of excavators accelerates this environmental damage.

Much of what is being lost is still unknown. A 2022 Greenpeace expedition that studied previously unexamined areas highlighted the existence of undiscovered species and soil microorganisms. These microorganisms are vital for potential uses in medicine and agriculture, yet they are being destroyed.

The expansion of mining is enabled by 320 airstrips located on Indigenous lands, which require the clearing of vegetation. Miners also hunt animals such as monkeys and capybaras. This activity compromises crucial ecological processes like seed dispersal and pollination, while also creating competition with Indigenous Peoples for food sources.

A new development model that preserves the forest is urgently needed.
