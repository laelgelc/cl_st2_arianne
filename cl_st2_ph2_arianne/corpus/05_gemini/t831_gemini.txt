Corporations are using tactics known as SLAPPs (Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation) to silence critics with meritless lawsuits.

Resolute Forest Products, for example, filed a CAD$7 million suit in Canada against Greenpeace Canada. The company also launched a CAD$300 million lawsuit in the U.S. against Greenpeace entities, Stand.earth, and individuals. This U.S. suit used RICO laws to allege fraud.

In another case, residents of Uniontown, Alabama, were sued for USD$30 million over a coal ash landfill. With assistance from the ACLU, they settled the case and secured better protections.

Despite the existence of anti-SLAPP laws in some regions, the use of these lawsuits is on the rise. To resist them, the "Stand FIRM" acronym offers a guide: Fight back, Investigate, Rally, and Make noise.
