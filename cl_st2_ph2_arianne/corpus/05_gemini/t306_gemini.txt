The Covid-19 pandemic highlighted the vital role that urban green and public spaces play for health and well-being, offering relief from stress and a chance for reconnection with nature.

The benefits of these spaces include enhanced brain development and cognitive function in children, and reduced risks of non-communicable diseases like cardiovascular conditions and diabetes. They also contribute to lower mortality from pollution and inactivity, improved pregnancy outcomes, better perceived general health, and shorter hospitalization times. Furthermore, green spaces support mental health by lowering stress, depression, and anxiety. Urban civic spaces provide similar advantages.

The 3-30-300 Rule is a concept that promotes accessible greenery to combat climate change and biodiversity loss. In line with this, there are calls for authorities to ensure equitable urban greening.
