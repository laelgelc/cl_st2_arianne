Following global Greenpeace campaigns that included petitions, online actions, and protests, Samsung has committed to recycling its recalled Galaxy Note 7 phones. The company plans to achieve this by refurbishing unsold units, repurposing components such as cameras, and extracting raw materials in an environmentally friendly manner. Furthermore, Samsung will join a European Union research initiative to develop eco-friendly methods for recycling smartphones.

This issue highlights broader problems within the electronics industry, including the wasteful production of short-lived devices, the growing challenge of e-waste, the reliance on coal-powered factories, and the use of hazardous chemicals that harm workers and the environment. We urge all IT firms to adopt sustainable, repairable, closed-loop production models that are powered by renewables.

Greenpeace will closely monitor Samsung to ensure the company follows through on its promises. We will also be scoring brands on the repairability of their products.
