The ocean's beauty often conceals a range of hidden threats, from pollution and overfishing to illegal fishing, eutrophication, the climate crisis, and plastic pollution.

On International Women’s Day, we celebrate the women across the globe who are fighting to preserve ocean health, social stability, and food security. One billion people depend on fish as their primary source of animal protein, a figure that rises to 70% in Senegal. In West Africa, women, alongside small-scale fishermen, are actively opposing the fishmeal and fish oil (FMFO) industry. They are also challenging foreign vessels that overexploit fish stocks. These products are then exported to markets in Asia and Europe, a practice that harms local communities.

We call for government measures to be put in place, which should include establishing legal status for these women. We also invite you to join in a global online applause to thank them for their vital efforts.
