Women are on the frontlines of resistance against oppressions. The Iranian feminist uprising following the death of Jina Amini exemplifies this role. This movement united diverse ethnic, religious, and class groups in protests that demanded democratic values. The regime met these protests with violence. The uprising inspired global solidarity under the slogan "Jin Jiyan Azadi," which means "Woman, Life, Freedom."

To drive transformative change against colonial, capitalist, and patriarchal systems, it is essential to embrace intersectionality, solidarity, and learning from affected communities.

Three eco-feminist movements highlight this struggle. In India, the Chipko Movement utilized nonviolent tree-hugging to halt deforestation. In Argentina, the Ni Una Menos marches protest femicides and have fostered intersectional solidarity. The Iranian protests are another key example of an eco-feminist movement.
