The first round of UN negotiations for a Global Ocean Treaty has just concluded. These talks are about the future of the high seas, vast ocean areas that cover nearly half of our planet. These oceans face immense threats from industrial fishing, pollution, and the impacts of climate change.

A strong treaty must be finalised by 2020. This is essential to enable the creation of a network of ocean sanctuaries. As these negotiations continue, Greenpeace is campaigning against the influence of industry lobbying and urging for public involvement to secure a robust agreement. We have been taking action, with protests using banners and inflatable turtles, and by delivering origami to delegates.

While some nations are pushing for an ambitious treaty, others are lagging behind. An upcoming opportunity exists to create an Antarctic Ocean Sanctuary, a proposal already backed by a movement of nearly 2 million people.
