The seafood industry has hidden issues, including the exploitation of migrant workers from Southeast Asia. These workers often face abuse and inhumane conditions, and can be kept isolated at sea through the practice of transshipment.

At the same time, our oceans are under threat from climate change, facing challenges like warming and acidification. Healthy marine life is essential, as it can absorb carbon from the atmosphere.

However, overfishing is depleting fish stocks. This problem is compounded by illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing, which is valued at up to $23.5 billion annually. These practices harm biodiversity through destructive methods like bottom trawling, longlining, and purse seining with Fish Aggregating Devices (FADs).

The damage extends to coastal communities, whose livelihoods are directly impacted. As consumers, we have a role to play by choosing sustainable seafood options. We must also pressure governments to ensure ethical fisheries management.
