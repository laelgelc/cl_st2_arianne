The Vital Ocean Voices series shares stories from coastal communities in the Indian Ocean about the impacts of destructive fishing, pollution, and climate breakdown.

In Anse Royale, Seychelles, the Watershed Committee is restoring mangrove wetlands. This program, which began in 2016, involves members like Terence Vel and Monica Samson and includes activities such as creating nurseries, community planting, and workshops. The effort is a form of Ecosystem-Based Adaptation that helps to combat flooding, support biodiversity, filter pollution, and aid fishing livelihoods.

Community engagement has fostered a sense of ownership in the project. Despite past destruction of the wetlands caused by settlement and development, the restoration work has successfully increased the number of mangrove species in the area from three to six.
