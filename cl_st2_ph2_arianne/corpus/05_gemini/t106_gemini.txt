In Senegal, the community of Cayar, led by the Taxawu Cayar Collective, has taken legal action against the TPM fishmeal factory. The lawsuit alleges that the factory is polluting local water with toxic waste, which poses a threat to jobs, access to food, and public health.

On October 6, 2022, evidence was presented in court, including laboratory results that showed the presence of toxic metals and videos documenting illegal dumping activities. A ruling in November 2022 dismissed a request for a temporary shutdown of the factory, but the community's fight is ongoing.

By January 2023, the municipality of Cayar had banned the discharge of wastewater, a move that has led to further litigation. The broader fishmeal industry processes more than 500,000 tonnes of fish each year. According to local leaders and Greenpeace Africa, this level of processing exacerbates food insecurity.
