While World Fisheries Day on November 21 is an occasion to celebrate sustainable small fisheries, it also exposes the severe human rights abuses that plague industrial distant water fisheries (DWF). These operations are often driven by greedy corporations.

As fish stocks decline, vessels are forced to travel farther from shore. To cut costs on these long voyages, there is widespread exploitation of migrant workers, including forced labor. This tainted seafood then reaches global markets, a consequence of buyers failing to perform adequate due diligence in their supply chains.

Greenpeace has linked the Taiwanese firm FCF to instances of forced labor and illegal fishing. The problem is significant enough that the US Department of Labor has listed Taiwan for its use of such practices.

To fix this, governments must enforce protections for workers at sea. Consumers can also contribute to creating a better industry by reducing their seafood consumption and choosing to support local, sustainable options.
