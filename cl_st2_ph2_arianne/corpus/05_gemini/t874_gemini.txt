An anthrax outbreak on Russia's Yamal Peninsula killed a 12-year-old boy and more than 2,000 reindeer. The outbreak led to the evacuation of nearly 400 people, with over 100 hospitalized and 25 treated for the disease.

The crisis has had a profound impact on the local community. Indigenous Nenets herder Alexey Nenyanga lost most of his reindeer in the outbreak. His belongings were destroyed, and any potential compensation is uncertain.

The source of the outbreak was a hot summer that melted the region's permafrost, releasing century-old bacteria. The situation was made worse because authorities had canceled annual vaccinations in 2007.

This event is part of a larger pattern of climate-related disasters in the area. Two years earlier, extreme weather caused the tundra to become iced over, leading to the starvation of 58,000 reindeer. Climate change poses a direct threat to the survival of Indigenous people in the region.
