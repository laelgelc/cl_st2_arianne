Governments are failing to meet their Paris Agreement climate promises, a reality that is prompting thousands of people to seek justice through the courts. In response, the legal profession is mobilizing. The International Bar Association has created a Model Statute to aid judges and lawyers in assessing evidence and enforcing the rights of people to challenge governments and corporations. Greenpeace Southeast Asia is also contributing by offering a guide for public accountability.

Globally, over 600 climate-related cases have been filed. Notable examples include Urgenda's victory in the Dutch Supreme Court and the Klimaseniorinnen appeal in Switzerland. In Norway, a youth-led constitutional challenge is underway. This movement for legal accountability is further supported by a Peoples’ Summit declaration which demands access to justice. The fight extends to the corporate world, as seen in the Philippines, where companies like Exxon are being held liable for climate impacts.
