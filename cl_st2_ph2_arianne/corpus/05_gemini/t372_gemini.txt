In 2020, as the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted lives with isolation and health precautions, 'lockdown' was named Word of the Year. During this time, environmental crises intensified.

Greenpeace's 'Protect The Oceans' voyage was underway, inspecting ships and documenting climate impacts in the Antarctic. In Kenya, farmers adopted ecological practices to build climate resilience. Massive wildfires ravaged California and Australia, resulting in the deaths of both wildlife and people. In the Philippines, typhoons caused widespread flooding, prompting demands for climate justice. A disaster in Kamchatka killed marine life, leading to government action. Meanwhile, deforestation threatened the Amazon and the Gran Chaco, coral bleaching hit the Great Barrier Reef, and global floods affected millions. We applaud the activists who are documenting these threats.
