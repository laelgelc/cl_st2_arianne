In 2021, amid the pandemic and the climate crisis, activists engaged in courageous efforts. These included blocking a fossil gas vessel in Spain and protesting a sunken gas rig in Croatia. In the US, activists urged for a fossil fuel phase-out, and in Vanuatu, women demanded climate justice.

At the COP26 conference, protests targeted greenwashing, and global actions called for bolder measures. Other efforts to denounce greenwashing included painting a plane in France to highlight the issue in the aviation industry. In Germany, a message was projected onto a power plant. Activism also included Indigenous land demarcation in Brazil and the creation of an "oligarchy monster" installation in Indonesia.

Thanks were given to supporters for their role in these actions. Images are available in the media library.
