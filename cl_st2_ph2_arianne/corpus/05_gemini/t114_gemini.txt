Fossil fuel-driven climate change is causing unprecedented heat waves, wildfires, and droughts. Without urgent action, these events are becoming the new normal.

Record temperatures are being seen, including 53°C in Death Valley and 48°C in Tunisia, which has damaged crops. Deadly heat has impacted people in Spain, Canada, the UK, India, and other places, with marginalized communities being disproportionately affected.

This is happening because fossil fuel companies prioritize profits over people and the planet. A just transition to renewables is needed, and we can draw lessons from the responses to COVID-19.

Greenpeace campaigns worldwide are working to ban fossil fuel ads, end financing for the industry, reject dirty deals, and protect forests. There is still time to act and meet the 1.5°C Paris goal.
