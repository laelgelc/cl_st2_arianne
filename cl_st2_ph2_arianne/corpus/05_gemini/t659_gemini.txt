From the Greenpeace ship Esperanza, radio operator Yakup Çetinkaya has described two non-violent actions taken against the dirty palm oil trade. This industry is responsible for destroying Indonesian rainforests, which are the homes of orangutans and many other species. The forest fires set for palm oil production not only emit CO2 and contribute to climate change, but the resulting smoke also harms human health.

Wilmar, the world's largest palm oil trader, has failed to live up to its promises of sustainability. In response, our ship, the Esperanza, followed the tanker Stolt Tenacity on its journey from Indonesia to Europe. In one action, six of our activists boarded the tanker. They were detained for 33 hours before being released in Spain.

Later, as the tanker neared Rotterdam, Dutch activists took action again. Despite resistance from the crew and the cold weather, they managed to hang banners with the message "Stop dirty palm oil." Through these actions, we are demanding that Wilmar and the brands it supplies, such as Oreo, take responsibility and protect the world's rainforests.
