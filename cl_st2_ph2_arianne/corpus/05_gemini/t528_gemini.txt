Plastic pollution, which originates from toxic fossil fuels, is causing harm to communities and animals like turtles and seabirds across the globe. It is also a possible threat to human health.

In response, a Reuse Revolution is countering this crisis with innovative solutions that emphasize reduction and reuse. This movement includes the development of zero-waste cities, the installation of water refill stations, offering discounts for reusable bags and mugs, and the establishment of plastic-free markets.

Individual actions build the counterpower needed to challenge the throwaway culture. This can be done by using reusable items and by pressuring companies to change.

While companies admit they play a role in the plastic problem, they often promote false solutions. These include switching to paper or bioplastics, as well as focusing on recycling, chemical recycling, and incineration.

True progress will only be achieved when corporations actively reduce their plastic footprints and make significant investments in refill and reuse systems.
