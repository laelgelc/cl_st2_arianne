The influence of women in social, political, and economic spheres is being celebrated through the work of six inspiring Thai environmental activists.

Supaporn Malailoy advocates for environmental human rights, such as access to clean air and water. Panita Pook Kongsook, a long-time Greenpeace volunteer, promotes the use of non-violent action. In Prachuap Khiri Khan, Sureerat Taechutrakul helped to stop the development of coal plants.

Nanticha “Lynn” Ocharoenchai is the founder of Climate Strike Thailand, an organization created to pressure the government on climate issues. Standing up for her indigenous community, Pornchita Fapratanprai is opposing coal mining. Meanwhile, Gig Koranis Tanangsnakool researches and promotes alternatives to single-use plastics through social media.

These women embody courage and passion for their communities and the environment.
