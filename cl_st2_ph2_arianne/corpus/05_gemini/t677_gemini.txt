A global brand audit has revealed the significant role multinational corporations play in plastic pollution, with the equivalent of one truckload of plastic entering our oceans every minute.

The audit was conducted by 10,000 volunteers across 42 countries. In 239 cleanups, they audited 187,000 pieces of trash. The top polluters identified were Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, Nestlé, Danone, Mondelez International, and Procter & Gamble. Coca-Cola branded litter was found in 40 of the participating countries and was ranked among the top three polluters on six continents.

These companies are criticized for their reliance on disposable plastics. Systemic change and corporate responsibility are urged to address the problem. While consumer efforts are noted, the focus must be on these corporations. We are calling on people to help pressure these brands by sharing photos of branded litter they find with the hashtag #IsThisYours.
