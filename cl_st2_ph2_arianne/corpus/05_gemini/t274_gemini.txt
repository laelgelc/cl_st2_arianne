The remnants of Hurricane Ida brought devastation to the Northeast US. Communities across New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, and Maryland were hit with record-breaking rain, flash floods, and even a tornado. As the water rose in my own Brooklyn neighborhood, causing minor flooding, my first thoughts were to check on my loved ones.

Tragically, this storm claimed over 40 lives, and its impacts were not felt equally. Marginalized communities have been disproportionately affected by this disaster.

Officials have been clear, linking this extreme weather event to the fossil fuel-driven climate crisis. What we witnessed is not an isolated incident; it is part of a global pattern of escalating fires, heat waves, and floods. The recent IPCC report confirmed this terrifying reality, issuing a "code red for humanity."

The science is undeniable, and the path forward is clear. We must demand an end to fossil fuel subsidies and push for a just transition to renewable energy.
