Imagine your sink is overflowing, flooding your home. You wouldn't start by mopping the floor; you'd turn off the tap. To stop plastic pollution, we must turn off the source. Nestlé is a major source, having produced 1.7 million tonnes of plastic packaging last year, which marks a 13% increase.

Plastic has toxic origins, gets into our food and our bodies, and poses risks to our health. Nestlé must lead the way in solving this crisis. The company needs to adopt systems for refill and reuse, reduce its single-use packaging, and reject substitutes like paper or bioplastics.

Greenpeace activists confronted Nestlé at its Annual General Meeting. As Executive Director Jennifer Morgan stated, a Break Free From Plastic audit has identified Nestlé's role in polluting oceans, harming wildlife, and impacting communities.
