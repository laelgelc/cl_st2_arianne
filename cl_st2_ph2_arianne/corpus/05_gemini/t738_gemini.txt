We returned to the Amazon Reef aboard the Esperanza, facing rough seas and strong currents to continue exploring its extent. While initially estimated to cover 9,500 square kilometers, recent studies suggest this incredible ecosystem could span up to 56,000 square kilometers in the deep waters at the mouth of the Amazon River.

During our expedition, we discovered reef formations located inside the drilling blocks of the oil company Total. This discovery contradicts the company's own claims and has prompted a prosecutor to recommend that Total's license to drill be denied.

Further expeditions in French Guiana have revealed that these are connected reef systems. This highlights the immense risk of an oil spill, which could easily cross international borders.

Over two million supporters have already joined the call to stop oil drilling in the region. We urge you to sign the petition to help protect the Amazon Reef.
