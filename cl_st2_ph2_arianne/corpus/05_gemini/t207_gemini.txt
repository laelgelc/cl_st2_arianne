An excerpt from Vanessa Nakate's book highlights how educating African women and girls is a powerful tool in addressing the climate crisis. For those without an education, life choices are often limited to early marriage, farming, or domestic work. These circumstances, combined with barriers like a lack of internet access and job instability, leave little time or opportunity for activism.

The COVID-19 pandemic has worsened this reality, as cuts to school fees have put educational gains at risk. Nakate reflects on her own family’s commitment to education, contrasting it with the broader situation in Uganda, where gender parity in primary school gives way to gaps at higher educational levels.

This issue extends globally, with millions of girls out of school. Their absence from education limits their potential to take on roles in the crucial decision-making processes needed to tackle climate issues.
