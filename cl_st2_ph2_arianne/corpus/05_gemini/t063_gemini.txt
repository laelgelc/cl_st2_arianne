The World Economic Forum in Davos is marked by hypocrisy, with attendees arriving on private jets that emit massive amounts of CO2. They gather to seek capitalist solutions to problems such as inequality and environmental exploitation, which are the very consequences of capitalism itself.

An Oxfam report highlights the scale of this inequality, showing that the richest 1% have captured the majority of new wealth created since 2020. This underscores the need for wealth taxes. Instead of relying on profit-driven models, we should champion Indigenous wisdom and community-focused alternatives. The path forward requires taxing the rich, canceling debt, and prioritizing well-being over GDP. We must foster multilateral cooperation to achieve justice-based solutions.

Community innovations, particularly in the Global South, demonstrate that viable alternatives already exist. The World Economic Forum's efforts are ultimately undermined by the exclusion of those who are most affected by these global crises.
