In May 2020, a disaster unfolded near Norilsk, Russia, becoming the largest oil spill in the history of the polar Arctic. Over 20,000 tons of diesel spilled from a tank owned by Norilsk Nickel, polluting the Ambarnaya River.

We used space images to highlight the scale of the devastation. Following a lawsuit by the state environmental watchdog, Rosprirodnadzor, a court ordered the company to pay 146 billion rubles—nearly 2 billion USD—in damages, the highest penalty for environmental damage in Russian history.

Our work on the ground confirmed the pollution was spreading. In a joint expedition with Novaya Gazeta, and despite restrictions imposed by the company, we revealed that oil products were moving from the river toward the Kara Sea.

This event underscores the urgent need to phase out oil and transition to carbon-free energy. We must pursue a green recovery and address the devastating impacts these spills have on fragile ecosystems and Indigenous communities.
