According to Greenpeace scientist Dr. Paul Johnston, the planet is facing severe impacts from climate change. He notes that while the planet itself will survive, it will be in an altered state, with some changes like sea level rise and food insecurity already committed. Because of this, he emphasizes the importance of acting now to minimize the damage.

Dr. Johnston rejects climate denial, describing it as delusional, and warns against geoengineering, which he considers a false solution. Despite the challenges, he also highlights that progress has been made in environmental protections. He advocates for individuals to take personal actions to reduce waste and to influence others. In order to defend evidence-based research, he supports the March for Science. Dr. Johnston expresses optimism, even while acknowledging obstacles like fake news and funding cuts.
