An investigation by the GAIPE into the 2016 murder of Berta Cáceres reveals that the company DESA, the Honduran government, and financing banks were involved in the crime. The report states these parties played roles in the planning, execution, and subsequent cover-up, which began in November 2015.

According to the investigation, DESA, the company responsible for the Agua Zarca dam, deployed security personnel, hitmen, and used its influence over law enforcement to repress Lenca activists who opposed the project. The Honduran government protected DESA, while at the same time denying security to Berta Cáceres and directing state forces against the dam's opponents. The banks that financed the project ignored the repression.

The report situates this crime within a context of rising murders of environmental defenders, noting that 200 were killed globally in 2016. It emphasizes that these are systemic attacks in Honduras and highlights the need for justice.
