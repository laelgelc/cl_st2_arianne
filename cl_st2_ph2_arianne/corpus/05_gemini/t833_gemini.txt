In 1954, a hydrogen bomb test at Bikini Atoll irradiated Marshall Islanders and Japanese fishermen, causing deaths and ongoing health issues. This legacy of nuclear disaster continued with the 2011 Fukushima meltdown, which occurred because the operator, TEPCO, ignored safety warnings. The event led to multiple meltdowns and the ongoing leak of radioactive materials into the Pacific Ocean.

The financial consequences are staggering, with cleanup costs escalating beyond 21 trillion yen, a burden placed upon citizens. The social impacts are equally severe, beginning with the displacement of 150,000 people. The aftermath has been characterized by gender inequalities and corruption involving the Yakuza. In addition, people are being forced to return to areas that remain contaminated.

Nuclear power’s origins are tied to weapons production, and its use has created global dead zones like Chernobyl. It is seen as a symptom of industrial collapse, prompting calls for societal simplification.
