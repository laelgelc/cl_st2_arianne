The frustration is palpable. Crises like the Covid-19 pandemic and the escalating climate emergency have starkly revealed how neoliberal policies have limited our options. We are left vulnerable by a system that has consistently failed us.

For decades, the doctrine of free trade has been championed, but we must ask who it truly benefits. The evidence shows it has been a boon for corporations, often at the great expense of people and the environment. It is time to rethink the very rules of trade. Our global economic system must be rebuilt to prioritize human dignity, fair wages, and ecological sense.

The path forward involves relocalisation. This is not a call for isolationism. Instead, it is a vision for building resilient and sustainable supply chains that strengthen global communities through genuine internationalism and solidarity. By fostering local economies, we create a more stable and interconnected world.

To achieve this, we can use tools like tariffs to encourage economic diversification and enable a just transition for workers and communities. However, such economic shifts must be paired with robust social policies. To ensure these changes are accessible and equitable for all, they must be supported by programmes that guarantee affordable housing and a basic income. This is how we build a resilient future that works for everyone.
