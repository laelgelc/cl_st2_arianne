Black Friday and Cyber Monday drive billions in sales, but they also generate massive waste. This overconsumption harms the environment, with fast fashion being a significant contributor.

In response, Greenpeace advocates for reducing consumption through participation in "Buy Nothing Day." We are also calling for a "Time out for Fast Fashion." We urge people to wear, repair, swap, and reuse their clothes for longer. Fashion brands must also play their part and should design products for quality and longevity.

The environmental impact of fashion production is severe, as it pollutes water with toxins. Furthermore, the lifecycles of clothing have shortened. This trend has led to an overload in second-hand markets and has made recycling unviable. Ultimately, the majority of garments become waste, destined to be burned or sent to a landfill.
