Looking back at photos from campaigns between 1974 and 1982 evokes memories of our early history. One powerful memory is of the relationship with the Yalis Kwakwa̱ka̱ʼwakw community. In 1975, we returned a Sisiutl flag, and in 2015, we were honoured to receive a new one from them.

The 1975 whale campaign was a pivotal moment, playing a key role in Greenpeace’s international growth and leading to the acquisition of the faster ship, the *James Bay*. These campaigns were not without their challenges. The 1976 launch, for instance, was delayed by customs, and we recall the experience of navigating the treacherous Yucluta Rapids.

Alliances were crucial. In 1979, we stood with First Nations in Spatsizi Park to confront trophy hunting. Another memory from 1975 is a stop at the Tasu mine, which led to some auspicious encounters.
