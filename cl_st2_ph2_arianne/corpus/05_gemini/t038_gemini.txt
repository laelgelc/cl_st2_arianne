In the village of Berap in West Papua, Indigenous leaders from the Namblong tribe are actively mapping their clan boundaries. This vital work is being done to block palm oil plantation permits that are threatening their forests. One leader, Hendrikus ‘Franky’ Woro, has taken this fight a step further by filing a groundbreaking lawsuit challenging a Malaysian company’s permit on their traditional lands.

The struggle for these forests resonates with the younger generation. At a Papuan cultural festival held in Jakarta, young people gathered to discuss the deep connections between forest conservation, state violence, and their identity. They also spoke of the loss of local foods, such as sago, which is intrinsically linked to the health of their environment.

This situation is a reflection of a global issue: deforestation driven by a capitalist system’s demand for commodities. It is imperative that we end this destruction to protect biodiversity. The resistance seen in West Papua is a powerful example of how cultural preservation and the transmission of Indigenous wisdom to youth can drive systemic change. On World Forest Day, their fight highlights the critical importance of protecting our planet’s forests.
