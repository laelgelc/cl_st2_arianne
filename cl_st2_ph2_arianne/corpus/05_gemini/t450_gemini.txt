In 2019, we saw large-scale climate marches take to the streets. Now, the global pandemic has enforced physical distancing, limiting these kinds of protests.

Despite this, activists worldwide are continuing to demand climate action through innovative means. These include online actions and trending hashtags such as #DigitalStrike by Fridays For Future. We have also seen virtual and holographic marches, distanced physical protests, the use of social media solidarity symbols, and home-projected banners created with lights and shadows.

These inspiring examples emphasize that isolation will not silence our voices. We must turn this crisis into an opportunity to build a better post-COVID future for both people and the planet.
