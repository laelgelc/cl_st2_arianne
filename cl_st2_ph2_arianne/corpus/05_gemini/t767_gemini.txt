Humanity ignored historical warnings from thinkers like Malthus and Mill, and later from Paul Ehrlich's 1968 book "The Population Bomb," about population growth exceeding the ecological limits of the Earth. This has led to resource depletion, the collapse of biodiversity, and humanitarian crises.

The Green Revolution, in turn, has been critiqued for causing soil degradation, the disruption of the nitrogen cycle, and contributing to global heating. We are now facing the consequences of these issues, with stagnating crop yields and declining fisheries. Water scarcity currently affects 850 million people. Furthermore, despite lower population growth rates, malnutrition is on the rise.

To mitigate ongoing ecological destruction, it is necessary to address population stabilization and overconsumption. Scale must be recognized as a key driver of these environmental problems.
