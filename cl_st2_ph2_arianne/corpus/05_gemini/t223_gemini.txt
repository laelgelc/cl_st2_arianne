The climate crisis unequally affects millions of people and threatens future generations. The voices of those most impacted, especially Indigenous communities, are often ignored.

At COP26, young activists spoke out, demanding commitments and action. They included Yared Abera from Ethiopia, Samara Assunção from Brazil, Hindou Oumarou Ibrahim from Chad, India Logan-Riley from Aotearoa, Ryan Bestre from the Philippines, Ineza Umuhoza Grace from Rwanda, Txai Suruí from Brazil, Marinel Ubaldo from the Philippines, Vanessa Nakate from Uganda, Leala Pourier from the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, Aisha Akbar from Pakistan, and Maytik Avirama from Colombia.

Facing intimidation, these activists used their unique perspectives to make their voices heard.
