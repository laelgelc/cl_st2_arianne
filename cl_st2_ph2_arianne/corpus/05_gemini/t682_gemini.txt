I am deeply worried about climate change. The impacts that were once predicted for the future are already happening around us. As I attend the IPCC meeting here in Incheon, that worry is met with a sense of hope, a hope fueled by stories of action from across the globe.

This hope is found in the Swiss grandmothers who are suing their own government for climate inaction. It’s in the youth in Lebanon building solar panels, and in the people of Turkey standing up to block the cutting of ancient olive trees for a new coal plant. It’s in the German protestors protecting the Hambach Forest, in a young Swedish girl’s school boycott for the climate, and in the students in the US taking their government to court.

I think of my own childhood on the Jersey Shore, a landscape now forever altered by the devastation of Hurricane Sandy. It is the resilience of frontline communities like these that truly inspires. We must come together, drawing strength from these actions, to turn our collective despair into an unstoppable hope.
