Fossil fuel companies are destroying communities, polluting our planet, and profiting at the expense of vulnerable people. This injustice is starkly evident in unfair energy tariffs that penalize those who can least afford it. Low-income, low-usage customers are often forced to pay higher per-unit prices for their energy, a system that exacerbates poverty, especially amid the current energy crisis.

The real-world consequences are severe. Across Europe, high disconnection rates are leaving people without essential energy. In places like South Africa and Australia, the use of prepayment meters leads to self-disconnections when people cannot afford to top them up. This energy poverty has direct health impacts, as people suffer from illnesses caused by living in underheated homes.

Beyond the household, the fossil fuel industry's legacy is one of pollution, climate disasters, and human rights violations. While communities face these devastating impacts, companies like BP and Shell are reporting record profits.

This system of inequality must end. The path forward requires phasing out fossil fuels and transitioning to renewable energy. We must demand climate justice to dismantle the inequalities created and sustained by the fossil fuel industry.
