At COP15 in Montreal, Indigenous leaders from Canada, Brazil, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Indonesia were present to advocate for their rights to be included in the final biodiversity agreement. Their efforts resulted in the Kunming-Montreal framework recognizing their knowledge and practices as essential for the protection of biodiversity.

Despite facing challenges, including visa delays, these leaders made their voices heard. They participated in marches, held press conferences, and interrupted speeches. Throughout these actions, they emphasized the importance of traditional knowledge over technology and denounced their exclusion from the negotiation processes.

A historic march, with over 3,500 people in attendance, took place to highlight the leadership of Indigenous women in the defense of nature and rights.
