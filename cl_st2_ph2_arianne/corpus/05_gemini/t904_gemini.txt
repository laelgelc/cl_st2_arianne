In a major move for Arctic protection, leading brands such as McDonald’s, Tesco, Young’s Seafood, and Iglo have agreed to oppose the expansion of cod fishing. They are joined by the Norwegian Fishing Vessel Owners Association, the Russian Karat Group, and Espersen in this commitment, which targets the previously frozen Northern Barents Sea.

Together, they have imposed a moratorium on bottom trawling within this sensitive Arctic area, a region twice the size of France. This action serves to protect vulnerable species that inhabit the area, including polar bears, bowhead whales, and Greenland sharks.

Greenpeace credits this significant achievement to global public action. We will now monitor compliance with the agreement from our ship, the Arctic Sunrise. We will also continue to urge the government of Norway to establish a formal Marine Protected Area, making these waters permanently off-limits to all extractive industries.
