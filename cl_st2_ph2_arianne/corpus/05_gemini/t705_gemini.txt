Sarah-Jeanne Royer, a French-Canadian postdoctoral scholar at the University of Hawaii's School of Ocean and Earth Science & Technology, has reported that decomposing plastic creates a new source of greenhouse gas emissions. This source has not been accounted for in previous climate models.

These emissions are projected to increase as the production and accumulation of plastic continue to rise. The gases contribute to the effects of climate change, which include sea level rise, higher temperatures, damage to ecosystems, and extreme weather events.

The research identifies low-density polyethylene, a material commonly found in single-use plastics, as the highest emitter of these gases. Environmental conditions can significantly worsen the problem. Degradation in the ocean increases emissions by up to 488 times compared to raw plastic pellets. When plastic is exposed to sunlight on land, it results in even higher releases of greenhouse gases.

To address this issue, plastic production must be stopped at the source.
