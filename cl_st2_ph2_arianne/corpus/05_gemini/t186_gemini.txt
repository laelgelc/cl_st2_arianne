Women are at the forefront of the climate crisis, a struggle that is deeply connected with gender inequality, social injustice, and the disproportionate impacts on minorities, including Black, Indigenous, LGBTQ+, and low-income communities.

Across the Americas, personal stories highlight this multifaceted fight. In Brazil, Cláudia Farinha focuses on rural women's rights and uses communication as a tool for environmental organizing. Jackie Zamora from Mexico shares her journey with Greenpeace and speaks to the dangers that women defenders of the environment face. In the US, Julialynne Walker champions community gardening and education. A trans woman in Brazil draws a direct line between violence, the fight for rights, and access to the environment.

The movement is diverse in its approaches. A Canadian glaciologist contributes through her research on glaciers while fostering international solidarity. From Chile, Maria Paz Valenzuela uses mountaineering as a means for empowerment and to promote care for the planet. An Indigenous student in Brazil engages in activism to protect her lands and the climate. In the US, activist Billie Lee connects the struggle for trans rights with food sustainability and anti-oil protests.

These women stress the importance of collective action and education. They share a sense of urgency to combat the interconnected crises we face and to build a more just world.
