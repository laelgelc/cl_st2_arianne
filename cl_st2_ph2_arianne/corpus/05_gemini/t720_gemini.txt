Energy Transfer Partners (ETP) pushed forward with the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline without securing the consent of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe. During this process, the company bulldozed sacred sites and ignored government calls to halt its activities.

In its response to opposition, ETP has utilized excessive force and carried out arbitrary arrests. The company has also filed SLAPP suits against its opponents, including Greenpeace. To suppress dissent, ETP has ties to TigerSwan, a firm that employs military-style tactics. Furthermore, the company advocates for anti-protest laws and seizes property.

ETP's operational history reveals a poor safety record characterized by frequent spills and fines. In light of the company's disregard for human rights, Greenpeace USA has published a report, "Too Far, Too Often." This report calls on banks to end all financial ties with Energy Transfer Partners.
