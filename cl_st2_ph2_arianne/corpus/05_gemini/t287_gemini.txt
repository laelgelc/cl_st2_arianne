In Douala, Cameroon, plastic waste is the cause of recurring floods that block drains and bring devastating consequences. These floods ruin homes, destroy livelihoods, degrade water quality, contaminate food, and can even be fatal.

For Greenpeace volunteer Nathalie Wamja, this is a deeply personal issue, as she has seen her own family and friends affected. She observed that despite import bans being in place, plastic bottles and packaging continuously clog the city's gutters.

Driven by this reality, Nathalie advocates for a total ban on both the production and import of plastic. She believes this is necessary to promote sustainable alternatives, such as refill and reuse systems.

In her own life, Nathalie is committed to living plastic-free and reusing items daily. Her activism extends into her community, where she educates vendors on the plastic crisis and shares awareness articles and petitions via WhatsApp. She also organizes clean-ups with local associations. However, she understands that clean-ups are an insufficient solution without systemic change. To address the root of the problem, she conducts brand audits during these clean-ups to identify the specific companies responsible for the polluting products.
