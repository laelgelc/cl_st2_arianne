We are celebrating a significant commitment from Marks & Spencer to eliminate all hazardous chemical releases from its supply chain and products by 2020. As part of this pledge, M&S will phase out all perfluorocarbons (PFCs) by July 1, 2016. The company will also reinforce its ban on APEOs and set clear timelines for phasing out other priority chemicals.

Crucially, M&S has also pledged to be more transparent, starting with the release of discharge data from five of its suppliers in China. There are plans to expand this transparency in the future.

M&S is now the seventh brand to join the movement for a toxic-free future, following commitments from Puma, Nike, Adidas, H&M, C&A, and Li-Ning. This action sets an important example for the rest of the industry to take responsibility for its environmental footprint and move to detoxify our waterways.

We urge more brands to act now. We also call on the public to help build momentum by sharing this news and participating in the campaign to protect our water.
