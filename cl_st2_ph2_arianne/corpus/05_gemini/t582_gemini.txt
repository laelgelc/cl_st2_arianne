Some global heating denialists claim that current temperature rises are simply typical Holocene fluctuations. This is incorrect. The reality is that anthropogenic carbon emissions have caused unprecedented warming, which has broken through established Holocene trend lines.

The human forcings driving this change are the largest in history, and their heating effect is being amplified by positive feedbacks. This is occurring at a time when humanity's ecological overshoot is weakening Earth's resilience.

CO2 levels have surged to 415 ppm, with this increase happening at a rate 100 to 1000 times faster than the Holocene averages. Due to inertia in the climate system, further rises are suggested. This situation could lead to state shifts, a circumstance unlike any prior era.
