This September, people are taking action. Protests are being held at the Frankfurt Motor Show from September 11-15. In New York, the People’s Summit on Climate, Rights and Human Survival will take place on September 18-19 to prioritize rights within climate justice. Student strikes are planned for September 20 and 27, surrounding the UN Climate Action Summit on September 23.

On September 25, an IPCC report on oceans and polar regions will be released, urging the need for a Global Oceans Treaty. The anniversary of the New York Declaration on Forests is also exposing the failures of corporations to stop deforestation.

Greenpeace is running a global petition against oil drilling, alongside actions in New Zealand. Widespread involvement is needed to confront this crisis.
