Greenpeace Italy celebrates the Benetton Group's commitment to eliminate all hazardous chemical releases from its global supply chain and products by 2020. This follows similar pledges from Zara, Mango, Esprit, and Levi’s, which were made in response to activist and consumer pressure.

With 13 major brands now committed to detox, competitors like Calvin Klein, GAP, and G-Star Raw appear out of touch. More fashion houses must join this movement. We encourage you to share the "Detox Fashion" video to pressure brands like Victoria’s Secret to adopt non-hazardous alternatives and end pollution.
