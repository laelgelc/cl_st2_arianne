The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed fundamental flaws in our consumption-driven economies and our reliance on the natural world. In this light, recycling is shown to be an inefficient solution and a distraction from the core problems of overproduction and overconsumption.

A proposed alternative is a "slow circular economy," which prioritizes refusing and reducing waste in the first place. This model incorporates mindful design, resulting in products that are simple, repairable, durable, and modular. It also emphasizes the use of local, renewable, and non-toxic resources.

This approach stands in contrast to that of many corporations, which focus solely on recycling as a means to sustain their growth. However, new practices are emerging, such as incentives for repair, limits on advertising, and the development of alternative models. For genuine sustainability to be achieved, there is a need for greater transparency and localization, alongside the integration of circular principles into our broader social and financial systems.
