Nonhle Mbuthuma, an activist from Xolobeni, South Africa, has described supporting Greenpeace activists as they occupied Shell's oil platform. The platform was en route to the North Sea, where it was intended to extract up to 45,000 barrels of oil daily for over 20 years. She joined international advocates by boarding the vessel Merida to challenge Shell. In response, Shell obtained an injunction which threatened the peaceful protest with up to two years' jail time.

Oil drilling devastates communities, biodiversity, and the climate, especially in the Global South. This is highlighted by a successful South African court case that halted Shell's exploration along the Wild Coast. You can help by signing a petition that demands Shell stop drilling, shift to renewables, and pay for the damages it has caused.
