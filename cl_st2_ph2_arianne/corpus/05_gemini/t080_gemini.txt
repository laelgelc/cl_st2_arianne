The concept of "Nature Positive" is a vague framework that prioritizes a failed economic model over the actual protection of biodiversity. Its core flaw is allowing for so-called net gains, where the destruction of nature in one area can be offset by restoration projects elsewhere.

Proponents of this agenda have set targets of achieving zero net loss of nature from 2020, delivering net positives by 2030, and seeing a full recovery by 2050. These targets, however, are unscientific. The indicators being used to measure them, such as carbon storage and habitat extent, are not credible as they fail to capture the true complexity of biodiversity.

This agenda ultimately promotes the financialization and trading of nature, which creates a significant risk of greenwashing by industries seeking to continue their destructive practices. Governments must reject the inclusion of the "Nature Positive" framework in COP15 agreements. The focus should instead be on advancing genuine conservation policies that recognize Indigenous rights and work to curb destruction.
