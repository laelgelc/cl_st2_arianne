The model of “fortress conservation” evicts Indigenous Peoples and local communities from their lands. This approach has led to abuses, including harassment and murder by eco-guards in locations such as the Congo Basin. This colonial model must be discarded to prevent such injustices from being repeated in the effort to meet 30x30 biodiversity targets.

We must also be wary of offsets that enable corporate greenwashing. The alternative is to respect Indigenous rights and leadership in protected areas. Systemic changes are necessary to combat corporate greed and inequality. There are successful examples of community-led protections in places like Mexico and Brazil. True harmony with nature requires supporting the guardians of biodiversity.
