The planet is sending a clear signal. June was the hottest month ever recorded, and July is on track to follow suit. We are seeing the consequences in real-time, with extreme heatwaves scorching communities across the globe. In Europe, temperatures in France have soared to 45.6°C, while in India, temperatures exceeding 50°C have caused deaths and raised the terrifying possibility that parts of the country could become uninhabitable in the future.

By 2050, 75% of the world's cities are projected to face shifted climates as heat exposure continues to rise. A primary driver of this crisis is coal, which is responsible for 46% of global CO2 emissions. Despite this, European leaders are delaying the essential transition away from fossil fuels, citing economic concerns. This hesitation ignores the reality that a shift to net zero emissions could create jobs, yield massive health benefits, and save trillions of dollars.

But people are not waiting for politicians to act. Global protests are demanding change, from the successful movement to save Germany's Hambach Forest to the worldwide Fridays for Future strikes. To help connect this growing opposition, Greenpeace's Unite for Climate tour is travelling across Europe to expose the barriers to progress and highlight the devastating impacts of the climate crisis on communities.
