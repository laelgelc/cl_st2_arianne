The lockdowns brought many of us back to basics, like baking our own bread, fostering a new appreciation for life's essentials. This shift in focus was mirrored by remarkable crisis responses around the world. In the Philippines, cities deployed e-tricycles for food distribution. The city of Maricá in Brazil doubled its basic income, while Barcelona suspended municipal rent for its residents.

These actions offer a glimpse into a different future for our cities. We can envision a post-pandemic world with efficient public transport and thriving urban gardens. It could be a world with no ads in public spaces, fewer malls, and where universal access to housing and food is guaranteed through systems like community exchanges.

This vision moves beyond a critique of consumerism and into tangible action. Amsterdam is using the model of Doughnut economics to shape its recovery. Globally, there is growing momentum, demonstrated by C40's pledge for a green and just recovery. Cities like Milan, Paris, and Bogotá are expanding their bike lanes. In Freetown and Montreal, new food initiatives are taking root.
