The first week of COP27 in Sharm el-Sheikh was frustrating. Funding discussions have been marked by delays, and promises of $100 billion from richer nations to developing countries remain unfulfilled. In the negotiations, people and the planet have been sidelined, with the richest countries blocking a much-needed Loss and Damage Finance Facility to deal with climate impacts.

Despite these challenges, there have been positive developments. Loss and Damage was successfully placed on the agenda for discussion. France has called for a ban on deep sea mining, and support for a fossil fuel phase-out is growing. Civil society has made its voice heard through protests, and the presence of over 600 fossil fuel lobbyists at the summit has been exposed. However, a deeply concerning agreement has been made that allows for another decade of forest destruction.

For this summit to be a success, the final text must explicitly name fossil fuels as the cause of the crisis and commit to providing adequate financing to address it.
