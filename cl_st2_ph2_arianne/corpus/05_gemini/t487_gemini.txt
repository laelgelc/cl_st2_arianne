Air pollution from fossil fuels is a public health emergency. It is responsible for 4.5 million deaths worldwide every year, while coal, oil, and car companies profit. The use of fossil fuels is also linked to the climate crisis, yet companies and governments are failing to take sufficient action.

Inspiring examples from around the world show what is possible when people come together. In 2019, a community in Thailand used crowdfunding to pay for solar installations at seven hospitals to reduce their use of fossil fuels. In Jakarta, 31 citizens sued the government, an action that prompted public petitions and promises from the governor. In Belgium, a mother started an initiative to monitor air quality around schools, which sparked nationwide street closures and went on to influence elections.

These stories show that community action works. You can be a part of this change. We urge you to sign petitions and organize events.
