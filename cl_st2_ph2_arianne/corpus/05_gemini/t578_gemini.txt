The deep ocean is home to bizarre creatures and mysterious hydrothermal vents. One remarkable example is the Lost City, discovered in 2000. This vent field features towering chimneys and unique life forms that thrive in extreme conditions. It is possible that life on Earth originated at vents like these, through chemical reactions that create hydrocarbons.

These unique ecosystems remain poorly understood. However, they are now threatened by deep-sea mining licenses that could destroy them before they can be fully studied. Greenpeace's Pole to Pole expedition is visiting the Lost City to advocate for its protection from exploitation. We urge public support to safeguard these vulnerable marine habitats.
