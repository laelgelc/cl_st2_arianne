A Greenpeace Denmark study, "Dissected," has revealed that the meat industry is investing millions in European advertising. These campaigns are designed to counter the rise of vegetarianism, veganism, and flexitarianism.

Semioticians working on the study identified seven myths used in Big Meat's advertising. These campaigns exploit consumer desires for acceptance and well-being by portraying meat as: a climate solution, healthy, masculine, essential for good motherhood, patriotic, social, and a matter of freedom.

The advertising campaigns target vulnerable groups, including children, young adults, and parents. The study calls for public authorities to regulate meat marketing, implementing restrictions similar to those on tobacco and alcohol, in order to support planetary health.
