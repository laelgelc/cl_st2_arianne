Seamounts, which are underwater volcanic mountains, create hotspots for wildlife by upwelling nutrients from the seafloor. Because they are often located in the high seas beyond national waters, they face challenges to their protection. Destructive industries exploit regulatory gaps in these areas.

Greenpeace is campaigning for a global ocean treaty to safeguard ecosystems such as Mount Vema. On a pole-to-pole journey, we are researching ocean biodiversity and the threats facing our seas.

Mount Vema is a key example of what is at stake. It is an underwater mountain 4,600m tall, which is like 767 stacked giraffes. It was discovered in 1957/1959 by people seeking diamonds. Instead of diamonds, they found Tristan rock lobsters, which were then overfished. The seamount is now littered with harmful ghost fishing gear. A global ocean treaty is a way that places like Mount Vema can be protected.
