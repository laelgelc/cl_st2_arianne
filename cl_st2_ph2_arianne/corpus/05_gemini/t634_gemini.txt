A Polish TV investigation has exposed a scandal in which diseased cows were dragged to slaughter while in pain. The investigation revealed that their rotten meat was then distributed to 14 European countries, including to school canteens, without any veterinary checks.

This incident highlights ongoing issues within industrial meat production, which has previously been linked to crises such as mad cow disease and listeria. These problems are driven by profit-seeking and weak oversight. In Poland, high percentages of diseased livestock are still approved for consumption.

This system is harmful to public health, animals, and the environment. Industrial meat production contributes to deforestation, pollution, and the climate crisis. There is an urgent need for better regulation and transparency in the industry. A shift towards plant-based diets is also necessary. Individuals can take action by advocating for eco-friendly school meals and can find inspiration for plant-based eating by using the Greenpeace Cookbook.
