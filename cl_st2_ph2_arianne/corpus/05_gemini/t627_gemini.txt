Froilan Grate explains that plastic pollution began when multinational companies decided to dump single-use plastics in areas that lacked waste infrastructure, such as the Philippines. Having grown up in pristine Guimaras, he was shocked by the plastic-choked waters of Manila Bay. This led him to join GAIA to promote zero waste programs.

Through these programs, communities have been able to reduce their waste by up to 80% using segregation, composting, and recycling. Despite these efforts, 30% of the waste remains unmanageable. Communities are now demanding that corporations like Nestlé and Unilever stop producing these plastics. As part of the Break Free From Plastic movement, Grate is joining Greenpeace's global ship tour to expose these companies and urge them to take real action beyond empty promises.
