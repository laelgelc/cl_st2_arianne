There is international outrage over Putin's invasion of Ukraine. We must show solidarity through donations, protests, and support for refugees.

Banks and investors must stop funding the Russian fossil fuels that are financing this war. We urge financial institutions like Credit Suisse, Schroders, Pictet, East Capital, Carnegie Fonder, Intesa SanPaolo, UniCredit, Société Générale, Raiffeisen Bank International, and UBS to take action.

Protests are already targeting banks in Vienna and the Czech Republic. To achieve peace, money must be redirected from conflict-fueling fossil fuels to renewables. It is important to note that European institutions have played a role in building Putin's power.
