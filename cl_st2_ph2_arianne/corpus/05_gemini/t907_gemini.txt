On World Tuna Day, our ship, the Esperanza, is in the Indian Ocean confronting Thai Union for its destructive fishing practices. As the owner of brands like John West and a supplier to Walmart, Thai Union’s operations threaten tuna populations, our oceans, and the communities that depend on them.

A key issue is the use of Fish Aggregating Devices (FADs), which cause 104,000 tonnes of bycatch every year, including species like silky sharks. Foreign vessels are depleting local tuna stocks, which harms local economies. In 2014, a record 4.8 million tonnes of tuna were caught, and three-quarters of bigeye and yellowfin stocks are now overfished.

Furthermore, unregulated FADs pollute the marine environment with plastics and batteries, often washing up on beaches and damaging coral reefs. Citizens have found discarded fishing gear and successfully linked it to Thai Union.
