According to Yewande Omotoso, climate change is a human rights crisis. It threatens our fundamental rights to life, property, health, and culture. In response, she highlights the global movement for climate justice, which uses legal action to hold fossil fuel corporations and governments accountable.

Omotoso discusses several inspiring cases that show this movement in action. In the Philippines, an investigation has been launched into the "Carbon Majors." A group of senior citizens in Switzerland is legally challenging their government over inadequate climate policies. In South Africa, a court ruling successfully stopped the construction of a new coal-fired power plant. Meanwhile, Colombian youth have taken legal action to protect the Amazon, and in the United States, young people are suing their government.

Yewande Omotoso shares how these efforts help combat the feeling of being overwhelmed by the scale of the crisis. They serve as a source of inspiration, encouraging action against the climate "monster."
