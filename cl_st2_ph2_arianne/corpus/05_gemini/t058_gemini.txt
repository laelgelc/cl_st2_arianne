Greenpeace activists from countries hit by the climate crisis occupied a Shell ship that was transporting equipment for the Penguins oil and gas field located in the North Sea. The protest, which lasted for 13 days from January 31 to February 12, became the organization's longest-ever protest on a moving platform.

This action was intended to highlight Shell's record profits of $39.9 billion, which were announced amidst global climate damage, such as the floods experienced in Pakistan. The protesters demanded that Shell cease all new drilling operations and start paying for the destruction its operations have caused. The Penguins project alone is projected to emit 45 million tonnes of CO2.

During the protest, Shell obtained a court order and pursued a $120,000 damage claim against the activists. Despite these measures, more activists joined the occupation. The protest concluded when a banner was displayed in Norway.
