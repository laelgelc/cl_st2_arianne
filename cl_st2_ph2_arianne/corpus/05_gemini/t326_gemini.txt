On International Workers’ Day, we celebrate the historical achievements of workers. Their resilience and collective power won us rights like weekends off and sick pay.

Greenpeace supports a just transition for workers moving from polluting industries, like fossil fuels and aviation, to sustainable ones. To ensure this transition is fair, it must include social safety nets, re-training, employment guarantees, and the involvement of unions.

Polluters, especially fossil fuel companies, should fund this shift. Their denial tactics cause harm to workers. To achieve environmental and social justice, we need tailored policies, investments in green jobs, and collective action.
