From aboard the Polar Pioneer in the Pacific Ocean, Aliyah Field is preparing to scale an oil rig to protest Shell's Arctic oil drilling. In doing so, she is overcoming her own personal fears and discomforts.

She is taking this action to highlight the immense environmental risks posed by this drilling, which threaten our clean air, stable weather, and beaches. The future of a habitable planet for new generations is at stake.

Aliyah urges readers to join her, her five teammates, and a movement of over 6 million supporters. She stresses that despite any individual obstacles, it is our collective determination that will ultimately succeed in halting corporate greed.
