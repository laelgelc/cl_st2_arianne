The corona crisis is cracking the very systems and power structures that require long-term, systemic change. As society looks towards a post-crisis future, it faces a fundamental choice: either restore the status quo or envision new economies that prioritize human and planetary wellbeing.

Unlike the response to the 2008 crisis, which favored polluting industries, this recovery must treat our planet as 'too big to fail'. The focus must be on reducing our climate impact and fostering a green and equitable future. Investments in green sectors have the potential to create 65 million jobs by 2030 and yield billions in gains.

To ensure this outcome, economic packages must follow a 'do no harm' principle. Support should be directed towards workers and vital transitions, such as phasing out fossil fuels, implementing ecological farming, and developing sustainable mobility. Subsidizing polluters must not be part of the recovery.
