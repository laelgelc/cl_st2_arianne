The year 2021 brought a cascade of extreme weather events across the globe. Madrid and Texas experienced record-breaking cold waves. Cyclone Eloise devastated Mozambique and neighbouring countries. Beijing was choked by a severe sandstorm. Floods inundated communities in Australia and Europe. Raging wildfires swept through Turkey, Greece, and California, while flash floods hit parts of Asia. At the same time, deforestation in the Amazon continued, and fires burned in Patagonia.

Climate change is exacerbating these events. For many, it's easy to ignore the warnings until the impacts hit close to home. We can no longer afford to wait. This is a climate emergency that demands immediate action. We must phase out fossil fuels and accelerate the transition to renewable energy. It is crucial that we hold governments and companies accountable for their role in this crisis.
