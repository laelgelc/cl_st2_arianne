The Marine Stewardship Council's certification of an Antarctic krill fishery as sustainable has been met with objections from organizations such as the Pew Environment Group and the Antarctic and Southern Ocean Coalition. This certification overlooks three significant issues.

Firstly, it fails to consider krill's vulnerability to the impacts of climate change and ocean acidification. Secondly, the fishery's expansion into remote areas of the Southern Ocean is unsustainable. Finally, the certification was granted despite the fact that there is limited knowledge of krill's life history.

By providing this certification, the council legitimizes the exploitation of a species that serves as a foundational food source for whales, seals, penguins, and fish. This action has the potential to cause harm to these ecosystems. It is also noted that the harvested krill is not used for direct human consumption but is instead processed into oil and fish food.
