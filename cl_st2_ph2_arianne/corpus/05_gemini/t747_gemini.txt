The crisis of plastic pollution is escalating. Every minute, the equivalent of one truckload of plastic enters our oceans. This plastic breaks up into tiny microplastics that harm marine life and contaminate our water and our food.

In response, people took action for Earth Day across the globe. In South Africa and six European countries, activists created powerful sand sculptures. Volunteers organized river cleanups, from the Nairobi River in Kenya to the Anacostia River in the U.S., where they collected data to identify the brands responsible for the pollution. Worldwide, volunteers pushed corporations to act by cleaning up sites like Malaysia’s Batu Caves, engaging with supermarkets in Spain and the UK, and educating communities in Senegal. In Mexico, activists used art to raise awareness.

These actions were supported by over a million people who signed petitions demanding change. To join the movement and organize an action in your own community, download the Million Acts of Blue toolkit.
