An Unearthed investigation has revealed that garment waste from brands like Nike, Ralph Lauren, and Diesel is being burned in Cambodian brick kilns. This practice exposes workers to toxic fumes from the polyester in the clothing.

This is a stark illustration of fast fashion's linear model, the exploitation of communities in the Global South, and the greenwashing that occurs despite brands' sustainability claims. Greenpeace's own past campaigns have exposed the industry's pollution and waste dumping in East Africa.

The COVID-19 pandemic has only exacerbated the insecurity faced by workers, leading to situations of debt bondage. The industry's model, driven by tight deadlines, is incredibly wasteful, with up to 50% of materials being discarded.

There are urgent calls for brands to fundamentally change their practices. They must shift to a circular model and commit to producing fewer, more durable clothes. We also need robust EU regulations that enforce transparency throughout the supply chain and bring an end to this exploitation.
