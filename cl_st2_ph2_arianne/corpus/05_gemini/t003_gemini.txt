On World Environment Day, we are filled with pride for our global community. Our volunteers, supporters, activists, and campaigners work tirelessly every day to protect the environment. It is their passion that inspires us all to persevere, especially as the impacts of climate change become more visible through extreme weather events.

Leaders are ignoring these warnings. Shanghai just recorded its hottest May day in 100 years. Italy has experienced severe flooding, resulting in widespread damage and more than a dozen deaths. Events like these should not become the new normal. The images from these disasters highlight the difficulties people are facing globally and serve as a reminder that we must be united in the fight against climate change.
