On World Environment Day, I am filled with pride for Greenpeace's global pioneers. Our volunteers, supporters, activists, and campaigners tirelessly celebrate every day as environment day. Amid the visible impacts of climate change in our daily lives, their passion inspires us all to persevere.

We are witnessing extreme weather that is beyond normal, yet world leaders continue to ignore it. Shanghai recently recorded its hottest May day in 100 years. In Italy, severe flooding has caused widespread damage and resulted in over a dozen deaths.

Heat waves and other extremes are becoming routine, but this should not be our new normal. The images of these difficulties from around the globe should serve as a motivation for unified action against climate change.
