Our economic system, a system of "Fossil Capital," prioritizes endless growth over the well-being of people and the planet. It is a system that plunders resources, oppresses the most vulnerable, and deepens both inequality and the climate crisis, all fueled by a dependency on fossil fuels.

The 2008 financial crisis gave rise to austerity measures that sacrificed the future, creating crises that have now been worsened by the COVID-19 pandemic. In this system, the most oppressed communities bear the heaviest burden, while the powerful continue to benefit.

The impacts are devastating and widespread. We see climate deaths, increasing hardship for youth, women, and low-income communities, and a tragic loss of biodiversity.

As activist Kaossara Sani has urged, it is time for action. We must break the system that is failing us. It is time to launch a #FossilFreeRevolution.
