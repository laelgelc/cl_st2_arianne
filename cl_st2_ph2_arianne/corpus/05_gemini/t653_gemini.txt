Stretching 8,100 km across Australia's southern waters lies the Great Southern Reef, a productive ecosystem built on seaweed forests. These forests capture carbon and support hundreds of unique species, with 85% of them being endemic, found nowhere else on Earth. The reef is also a destination for Antarctic whales.

Due to harsh conditions, much of this underwater world is often unexplored. Greenpeace's ship, the Rainbow Warrior, is currently conducting surveys in the region, including first-time dives off Kangaroo Island. This exploration follows a recent study that identified 400 new marine species in the Great Australian Bight.

This vital ecosystem is at risk from oil drilling. A potential spill would be devastating to marine life, as well as to local industries and communities. Beyond the immediate risk of a spill, burning more oil exacerbates climate change. With renewable alternatives available, the oil industry is outdated.

Help us spread the word and urge the Australian Government to protect the Great Southern Reef.
