From my perspective as an Indigenous campaigner with Greenpeace USA, I see the global struggles of Indigenous Peoples to protect our cultures, our lands, and our sacred natural elements. We face threats from development, deforestation, and climate change.

On this International Day of the World’s Indigenous People, we celebrate the frontline activists in these struggles. There are supportive organizations and projects in countries around the world, including the US, Brazil, Argentina, Cameroon, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Morocco, Russia, and Indonesia.

Environmental and social justice are intertwined. Indigenous territories hold 80% of the world's biodiversity, and for this reason, climate justice requires Indigenous sovereignty. Greenpeace stands in solidarity with Indigenous Peoples and is planning a global summit focused on human rights and climate change.
