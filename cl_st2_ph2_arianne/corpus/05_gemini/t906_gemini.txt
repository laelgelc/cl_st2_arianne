Aboard our ship, the Esperanza, we are navigating the vast Indian Ocean to locate and remove dozens of Fish Aggregating Devices (FADs). These FADs are left by reckless fishing vessels that supply Thai Union, and their presence leads to the deaths of non-target marine life as bycatch.

To find these devices, we are using the Esperanza’s reach and advanced technology, including solar-powered UAVs, an underwater ROV, and powerful binoculars. The components from the FADs we retrieve are not wasted. They are either returned to local artisanal fishermen or repurposed into solar-powered lamps and chargers.

These actions at sea directly challenge the destructive practices of Thai Union. Further efforts are also planned on land.
