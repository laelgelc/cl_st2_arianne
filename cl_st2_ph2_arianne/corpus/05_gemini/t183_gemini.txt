The path to limiting global warming to 1.5°C has been outlined by the IPCC's Working Group III Report, and it demands urgent action. To achieve this, we must halve global emissions by 2030.

The solutions are already here. We can achieve this goal by scaling up solar and wind power, promoting forest conservation, implementing efficient agriculture, and boosting energy efficiency. Many of these actions are available at low or even negative costs.

Systemic change is essential to unlock this potential. This requires tripling investments in climate solutions while ending the flow of money to the problem by cutting fossil fuel subsidies. At the same time, rising climate litigation is emerging as a powerful force for governance. A focus on equity is also needed to address the responsibility of high emitters.

The report’s assessment of our current trajectory is clear: no country is meeting the required emission cuts. Therefore, transformative changes are essential. These changes must be driven by strong policy, innovation, and unwavering public pressure to phase out fossil fuels and ensure a just transition.
