In an open letter, Seychellois conservationist Jeremy Raguain has called on Western Indian Ocean island leaders to take action amid the climate and ecological crisis. He urges them to address the threats of unsustainable fishing, over-tourism, fossil fuel exploration, and deep seabed mining.

Raguain proposes six solutions for the region's leaders. He calls for a ban on fish aggregating devices and the enforcement of the polluter pays principle. To counter over-tourism, he suggests that carrying capacities must be assessed before any new hotel developments are permitted. He also advocates for a moratorium on fossil fuels and the rejection of deep seabed mining through the application of precautionary measures. Furthermore, Raguain pushes for the expansion of marine protected areas, including the specific designation of the Saya de Malha Bank as a UNESCO site, and for leaders to support a Global Ocean Treaty.

He ends his letter with a warning that leaders face replacement if they fail to act.
