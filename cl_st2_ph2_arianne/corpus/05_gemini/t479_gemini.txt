On International Women’s Day, March 8, fossil fuel companies attempt to improve their image by sponsoring events, running promotions, and tweeting about women's careers or gender gaps in tech. This practice, which also includes sponsoring cultural activities, is a form of "gender-washing" and can be compared to greenwashing, where companies falsely appear to be environmentally friendly.

The core activities of these companies—extracting, transporting, processing, and burning fossil fuels—cause pollution, spills, and climate breakdown. These outcomes disproportionately harm women. They are impacted through environmental damage, extreme weather, and an increased vulnerability to gender-based violence. If these companies truly care about women's rights, they should stop their harmful activities.
