Today, on International Whale Shark Day, we celebrate the gentle giants of our oceans. These creatures, which resemble a mix of a whale and a shark, are found in tropical waters such as the Maldives, the Philippines, and Mexico. They are the largest non-mammalian vertebrates and feed mainly on plankton, posing no threat to humans.

Despite their docile nature, whale sharks are hunted for their fins and meat. Their slow breeding habits make them vulnerable to overfishing. Each individual has unique patterns, like human fingerprints, which are used for tracking. The IUCN lists them as highly vulnerable. While countries like Indonesia have conservation laws in place, enforcement is weak. Let's raise a glass to protect these animals and their ocean home.
