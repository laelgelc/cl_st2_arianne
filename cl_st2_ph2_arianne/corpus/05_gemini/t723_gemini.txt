Global concerns are growing over oil pipelines and their risks of spills, which threaten water, wildlife, ecosystems, and communities. Across the world, Indigenous-led resistance is rising against projects like the Kinder Morgan pipeline, now Canadian-owned, as well as Keystone XL, Enbridge’s Line 3, and the Bayou Bridge pipeline. Those resisting the Dakota Access pipeline are now facing a $900 million SLAPP lawsuit by ETP.

These fears are justified, as spill statistics show frequent incidents by companies such as Kinder Morgan, TransCanada, Enbridge, and ETP. In the face of this threat, the industry has employed tactics like lawsuits and intimidation.

The only real solution is to shift away from fossil fuels and invest in renewables. This transition is being powered by nonviolent actions on the front lines. Communities are celebrating tactics that include building Watch Houses, installing solar panels in the path of construction, and engaging in civil disobedience.
