Activists from Greenpeace Spain have installed a 12-meter train model at Barcelona-El Prat airport. The installation is a protest against the airline sector's environmental impact and the airport's planned expansion, a project that would damage local wetlands and cost 1.7 million euros.

This action highlights the problem of Europe's poor rail connectivity. It serves as a call to invest in accessible and affordable trains instead of polluting planes and cars. The protest also criticizes the model of low-cost tourism.

Our demands include the creation of 30 new cross-border rail connections by 2025, improved compatibility between train systems, and easier access for bikes and pets on board. We are also calling for an end to airline subsidies, such as through the implementation of kerosene taxes, and for the termination of short-haul flights where viable train alternatives are available.

A petition and a video have been created to promote these demands.
