Gustav Martner, Greenpeace Nordic's Head of Creative and a former advertising industry professional, has returned to the Cannes Lions Festival. He went back to return awards he had won for work with airlines and car companies, disrupting the ceremony to call for an EU ban on fossil fuel advertising and sponsorship.

Martner criticizes the ad industry for awarding polluters and engaging in greenwashing while ignoring climate crises like wars, droughts, and record heat. His own perspective shifted after seeing films such as An Inconvenient Truth. He notes that even after the Paris Agreement, the industry has continued to give awards to fossil fuel campaigns.

He also points to delay tactics exposed by the IPCC, providing the example of BP's carbon footprint calculator, which serves to shift blame for the climate crisis onto individuals. To push for the proposed EU ban, a European Citizens' Initiative is seeking one million signatures.
