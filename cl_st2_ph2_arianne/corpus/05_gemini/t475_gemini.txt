A Greenpeace East Asia report has exposed links between Taiwanese seafood giant Fong Chun Formosa (FCF) and severe abuses in the fishing industry. FCF, a top tuna trader with an annual revenue of $45 billion, has been connected to forced labor on migrant workers, illegal fishing, shark finning, and transshipment at sea.

The exploitation is enabled by Taiwan's two-tiered system, which excludes vulnerable Southeast Asian fishers from proper labor protections.

We urge the Taiwanese government to abolish this system, adopt International Labour Organization (ILO) conventions, enhance inspections, and create grievance mechanisms for workers. We also call on FCF to take immediate action by disclosing its suppliers, ending the practice of transshipment, ensuring adequate monitoring, and upgrading its human rights policies.

Consumers can help combat these industry abuses by reducing their seafood intake and supporting local fisheries.
