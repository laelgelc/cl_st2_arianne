Fifty years ago, MIT scientists published "The Limits to Growth," a book presenting 12 scenarios on the ecological risks posed by unchecked growth. It was not a book of specific predictions. Despite this, critics such as Ronald Bailey have misrepresented its work as having forecasted resource shortages.

Defenses of the book from figures like Matthew Simmons and Graham Turner have shown that real-world data aligns with its "business as usual" crisis scenario. This is evidenced by ongoing global heating and biodiversity loss. Updates to the original study have confirmed that our patterns of consumption are unsustainable.

One of the book's authors, Donella Meadows, emphasized that its proposed interventions were often overlooked. She also highlighted the ideological attacks the work received from advocates for limitless growth.
