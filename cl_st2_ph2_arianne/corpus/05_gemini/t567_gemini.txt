On 31 July, people in over 25 cities worldwide, from the Philippines to New Zealand, are publicly holding the oil industry accountable. They are taking action against the climate anxiety, breakdown, disasters, and emergencies caused by the industry, acting either due to direct harm or in solidarity.

Posters are appearing in public spaces showing generic images of predicted climate impacts, such as severe forest fires, extreme rainfall, intensified hurricanes, and frequent extreme temperatures. These materials also feature data on the 10,000 oil tanker spills that occurred in 2018, broadly blaming the industry.

The action connects oil companies' historic pollution and their current lobbying against climate policy to the worsening extreme weather events. The message urges an end to oil. The campaign is supported by resources that include a Carbon Brief map, videos on wetter hurricanes and extreme heatwaves, and BAMS reports.
