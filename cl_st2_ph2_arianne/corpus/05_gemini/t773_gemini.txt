Historically, women faced significant barriers preventing them from joining expeditions to Antarctica. They were rejected based on assumptions that they would miss shops and hairdressers, could not handle the extreme temperatures, that facilities were unsuitable, or that their scientific capabilities were lacking. This everyday sexism resulted in some women being excluded from the continent until the early 1980s.

Despite these obstacles, women’s determination has triumphed, and they now play active roles in Antarctic science and the protection of the region. Onboard Greenpeace’s Arctic Sunrise expedition, women are working as scientists, crew, campaigners, and in other vital roles. The aim of this expedition is to help establish the world’s largest protected area—an Antarctic Ocean Sanctuary—by the end of the year. In celebration of this work, a video has been created for International Women’s Day.
