Our habit of excessive buying is fuelling climate change, destroying forests, and polluting our oceans. This hyperconsumption, seen in our food, fashion, and technology choices, has to stop.

We are buying twice as many clothes as we used to, yet wearing them for half as long. Products are often designed with planned obsolescence, creating unnecessary waste. Frequently, it is even costlier to repair an item than to buy a new one.

MAKE SMTHNG Week is an initiative promoting a different path. We are urging a cultural shift towards valuing our resources. This means repairing things instead of throwing them away, upcycling, choosing vegan alternatives, and refusing single-use plastics.

From November 23 to December 2, 2018, we invite DIY enthusiasts to join global events hosted by Greenpeace and our partners.

To get involved, you can consult the guidelines, browse the events calendar, and use the branding toolkit. Follow along on Instagram at @makesmthng and join the conversation with #makesmthng.
