Spanning North America, Russia, Japan, and Scandinavia, the Boreal Forest is the planet's largest ecosystem and a vital carbon absorber.

In Canada, this forest faces threats from Resolute Forest Products. The company logs in Indigenous territories without consent and destroys the habitat of endangered woodland caribou.

In 2013, after these practices were exposed, Resolute Forest Products sued Greenpeace and its staff for $7 million in an attempt to silence us.

To spotlight this issue, we are calling for 100,000 people worldwide to message Resolute CEO Richard Garneau. It's time to #StandForForests.
