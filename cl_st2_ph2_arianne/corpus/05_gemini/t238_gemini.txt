The COP26 Glasgow Agreement keeps the 1.5C goal alive. The agreement calls for 45% emissions cuts this decade and includes a weak phase-out of coal and fossil fuel subsidies, which is the first time such a measure has been mentioned in a COP text.

However, the agreement falls short on the urgent action required. It is an insult to climate-vulnerable communities because it failed to deliver the promised funding for recovery, adaptation, and loss and damage. Furthermore, offsets received a disappointing boost, with loopholes that endanger nature and Indigenous Peoples.

The progress that was achieved was pushed for by activists, Indigenous leaders, and youth, through their protests and demands. Looking ahead, COP27 in Egypt must bring stronger targets and finally end fossil fuels.
