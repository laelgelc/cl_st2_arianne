On February 28, the second part of the IPCC's Sixth Assessment Report is scheduled for release. This report builds on the "Code Red for Humanity" warning from last August. It will address the impacts of the climate crisis on humanity and ecosystems, as well as our vulnerabilities.

The report will also cover building resilience, coastal communities, and the importance of social justice in climate-resilient development. It will explore adaptation solutions for unavoidable changes, including warming and rising sea levels.

A third part of the report, which will cover emissions cuts, is due in April, followed by a synthesis in October. These reports are vital for the discussions at COP27. Since the last assessment in 2014, climate conditions have worsened, with record warm years being registered. It is essential that we heed the scientists.
