Single-use plastic packaging from holiday gifts contributes to a significant environmental problem. Only 9% of all plastics are ever recycled. Every minute, the equivalent of a truckload of plastic enters our oceans, where it harms marine life and makes its way into our food chains.

Corporations are to blame for promoting a culture of convenience and mass consumption, all while shifting the responsibility for the resulting plastic waste onto consumers. In 2018, however, pressure from consumers led to some progress. Companies including Kroger, McDonald's, and Starbucks began taking steps to reduce their plastic footprint, starting with items like plastic straws. Despite this, more action is needed.

For 2019, resolutions should include eliminating personal use of single-use plastics. We must also demand that corporate and political leaders take action to phase out throwaway plastics entirely. This is essential to address the full environmental, health, and justice impacts of the plastic crisis.
