A catastrophic mudslide has followed the collapse of a mining dam in Brumadinho, Brazil, resulting in 60 confirmed deaths with over 290 people still missing. The aftermath is filled with personal stories of grief, as well as evacuations and ongoing fears due to the potential failure of a second dam.

This disaster, linked to mining greed, echoes past incidents. The environmental damage is severe, with sludge spreading up to 220 km. The toxic mud has led to dead fish and is impacting the Paraopeba River and Indigenous lands.

Greenpeace activists are on the ground documenting the tragedy. They are working to amplify the voices of the victims while demanding justice. The demands include thorough investigations into the collapse and reparations for the damage caused.
