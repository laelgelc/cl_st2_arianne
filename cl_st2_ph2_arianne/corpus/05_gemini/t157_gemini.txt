Oil companies like Chevron and Shell are pushing carbon capture and storage (CCS) as a solution to the climate crisis, but it's a scam. They use public subsidies to feign climate action while actually working to boost oil production.

The track record of these projects reveals their failure. In Australia, the Gorgon project received $60 million in handouts but has captured only 2% of its total emissions targets. In Canada, Shell's Quest plant actually emits more greenhouse gases than it captures.

The technology itself is flawed. CCS requires a significant amount of extra energy to operate, which in turn increases emissions. After decades of development, all CCS facilities globally capture just 0.1% of annual CO2. Often, this captured carbon is used for enhanced oil recovery, a process that pushes more oil out of the ground.

Scientists have labelled CCS a pipe dream, recognising it as a scheme to continue subsidizing the fossil fuel industry.
