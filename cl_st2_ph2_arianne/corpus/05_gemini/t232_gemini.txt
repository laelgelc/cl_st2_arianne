My journey with Greenpeace Africa began in 2011, after a career in journalism in Cameroon. I started as a Communications Manager and have since progressed to become the Head of Communications.

Looking back, several key campaigns mark this period. We opposed the expansion of nuclear power in South Africa, a long fight that concluded with the plan's abandonment in 2019. In West Africa, we used the Rainbow Warrior to expose illegal fishing activities, which ultimately resulted in the revocation of licenses. In Senegal, we launched a report detailing the impacts of overfishing, an action that went on to influence policy and shift narratives around migration.

We have also protested against dependence on coal, consistently promoting renewable energy and the need for a Just Transition. During the COVID-19 pandemic, I've had time to reflect on our ongoing work to combat corruption and the critical issue of deforestation in the Congo Basin. Our core mission persists: to continue changing the narrative in the fight for environmental justice.
