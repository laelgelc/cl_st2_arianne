Greenpeace has partnered with Brazilian actress Alice Braga to launch an animated series, "Countdown to Destruction." The series highlights how the industrial production of meat, dairy, soy, and palm oil is a driving force behind global deforestation, the displacement of Indigenous Peoples, and the worsening of the climate crisis. The post urges that this crisis be turned into an opportunity for equality and justice by amplifying Indigenous voices.

It also critiques the "nature healing" narrative that emerged during the pandemic, emphasizing that this view ignores the underlying systemic issues. The central problem is a model of infinite economic growth that clashes with the planet's ecosystems, with the Amazon being a focal point of this conflict. The Amazon is linked to global food chains, and while individual choices matter, it is imperative that brands and governments reform the unjust systems that perpetuate this destruction. Protecting the Amazon is essential for solving our climate challenges and for building a just society.
