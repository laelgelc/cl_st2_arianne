The climate crisis is driving rising temperatures, which are drying out forests and intensifying fire seasons across the globe.

In Siberia, a combination of extreme heat, oil spills from thawing permafrost, and unfought fires has led to over 22 million hectares being burned. In Brazil, deliberate fires are being set for agriculture, a situation worsened by Bolsonaro's policies that threaten Indigenous Peoples. Similarly, in Argentina, intentional fires for farming and real estate in the Paraná Delta and Cordoba are being exacerbated by a severe drought.

California is also facing massive blazes, sparked by heatwaves and lightning. These fires are forcing evacuations and worsening air quality amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The impacts of these events disproportionately affect Black, Brown, and Indigenous communities.

This global crisis requires bold local and global action in order to protect forests and people.
