Research from Greenpeace Russia has revealed widespread concern over air pollution in the country's major cities. In Moscow, 82% of residents are dissatisfied with the air quality, a sentiment shared by 77% of those in St. Petersburg. The primary cause of this dissatisfaction is attributed to emissions from fossil-fuel vehicles.

In response to a prompt from the Human Rights Council, the Russian government has proposed the creation of low-emission zones. These zones would restrict vehicles that fall below Euro-3 standards. The government has instructed the cities of Moscow and St. Petersburg to develop roadmaps for implementing these zones.

This development is a breakthrough and is supported by a transport scenario Greenpeace published in 2017. The objective is to cut vehicle-related NO2 and CO2 emissions by 25%, an approach that follows successful models implemented in Europe. For this change to be effective, it must be complemented by improvements to public transport and bike infrastructure as part of the global effort towards green mobility.
