Back in 1961, my father explained a simple truth about oil. He predicted that because it is a finite resource, its production would inevitably peak as extraction costs continued to rise.

Today, we are seeing this prediction unfold. Global oil production is in decline. For the world outside of the US, Russia, and Saudi Arabia, the peak already occurred in 2017. Now, there are warnings that even Russian and Saudi output could see sharp drops.

The US shale boom has been portrayed as an answer to this, but it is unsustainable. This boom is fueled by debt and causes significant environmental damage. It has been described as resembling a Ponzi scheme, which is now leading to bankruptcies. At the same time, tar sands projects are failing, and the wider industry is facing investor withdrawal.

Given the clear economic and climate risks associated with this failing industry, we must transition to renewables.
