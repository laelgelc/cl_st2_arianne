The high seas are confronting threats from climate change, pollution, deep-sea mining, and destructive industrial fishing. Practices such as purse seining and bottom trawling deplete fish stocks and harm marine life. According to a 2018 study, as much as 54% of fishing on the high seas is only profitable because of government subsidies and low labor costs.

These low labor costs often involve the exploitation of migrant fishers. A Taiwan court case involving the vessel Da Wang illustrates how this can manifest as debt bondage, abuse, and excessively long hours. The problem of illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing further exacerbates both environmental damage and human rights abuses.

To address this, Greenpeace urges companies to adopt ethical sourcing policies. Consumers are encouraged to reduce their seafood intake and, when they do buy seafood, to choose products from sustainable, small-scale fisheries.
