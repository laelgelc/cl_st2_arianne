Onboard Greenpeace's Rainbow Warrior, Emma Thompson recounted her visit to Venice, where she joined a protest we called the "Last Tour of Venice." This action was designed to highlight the profound climate risks facing the city, including submersion, driven by the fossil fuel industry.

During her time with us, she criticized the greenwashing tactics employed by oil and gas companies. These corporations use sponsorships in our museums, universities, and sports to maintain their social license to operate. However, this strategy is being successfully challenged. We have seen significant victories, with institutions like Harvard University divesting from fossil fuels and others dropping their deals with companies such as BP and Santos.

Building on this momentum, we advocate for a ban on all fossil fuel advertising, similar to the regulations imposed on the tobacco industry. This movement is growing, supported by a European citizens' initiative. The call to action is further strengthened by the IPCC, which has exposed the industry's widespread disinformation campaigns. In a powerful stand, 450 scientists are now urging public relations and advertising agencies to cease all collaboration with fossil fuel companies.
