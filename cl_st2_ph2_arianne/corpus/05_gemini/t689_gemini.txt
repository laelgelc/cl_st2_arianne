Corporate power influences governments and international human rights law. Greenpeace uses the law to hold corporations accountable. A zero draft of a proposed binding treaty on business and human rights is currently under examination, which marks progress since 1992 when no consensus on the issue existed.

The draft requires corporate due diligence and extends liability to subsidiaries and suppliers. It also allows for lawsuits to be brought in multiple jurisdictions. However, the draft has limitations. Its scope applies only to transnational corporations, it lacks direct obligations for businesses, and it does not define specific human rights. The draft also fails to counter corporate privileges like the Investor-State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) system.

States are urged to address these shortcomings. Collective action is necessary to advance global accountability.
