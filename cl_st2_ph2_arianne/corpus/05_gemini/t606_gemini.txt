In Brasília, Brazil, the 15th Free Land Camp brought together over 4,000 Indigenous Peoples for the world's largest mobilization of its kind. The gathering was a space for music, dances, rituals, and the exchange of knowledge, as well as advocacy for their rights.

On the second day of the event, Indigenous leaders demanded that the government protect their lands. This call for protection comes as the Bolsonaro administration is weakening environmental laws.

Indigenous Peoples are on the frontlines, protecting forests against deforestation, which in turn exacerbates extreme weather around the world. The camp ended with a traditional march, a powerful demonstration of peaceful resistance. It is crucial to support these guardians of the planet.
