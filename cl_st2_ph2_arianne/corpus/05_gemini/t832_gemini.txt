The overconsumption of fashion, driven by online shopping, is failing to bring people lasting happiness. The appeal of new purchases quickly fades. A survey reveals that many people own more than they actually need, with figures showing this is true for two-thirds of people in Hong Kong and 60% in China.

Many spend hours each day on impulse buys in an attempt to relieve stress or boredom. However, the initial excitement from these purchases disappears fast, often replaced by feelings of guilt and emptiness. Advertisers exploit desires for self-worth, which traps people in a cycle of materialism described as "stuffocation." This cycle is also harming the planet.

To break free, we need to slow down. We can pause before making a purchase and sleep on our decisions. Choosing to spend time in nature instead of at the mall is another way to opt out of this cycle.
