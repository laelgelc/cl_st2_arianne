Global calls are growing for banks to stop financing harmful tar sands pipelines. Projects such as Dakota Access, Kinder Morgan, Keystone XL, and Line 3 are being pushed through without consent, threatening Indigenous communities, clean water, wildlife, and climate stability.

In response, the Indigenous-led Mazaska Talks Global Days of Action took place from October 23-25. To #DivestTheGlobe, activists organized over 50 protests in more than 60 cities, spanning six different countries. These actions successfully disrupted banks that are financing the pipelines, including major players like Chase, Toronto-Dominion, and Credit Suisse.

The resistance against these projects highlights ongoing violations of Indigenous rights. In a direct effort to stop the pipelines, tiny houses have been built in the path of construction.

You can join the global pressure on these financial institutions. Please sign the petition to demand that banks stop financing these destructive pipelines.
