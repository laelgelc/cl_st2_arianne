In a memorial for co-founder Dorothy Stowe, the pivotal roles of women in Greenpeace's founding and early campaigns are honored. The idea to sail a boat to protest U.S. nuclear tests was first proposed by Marie Bohlen. Dorothy Metcalfe played a key part by managing media relations and lobbying governments.

During the early whale campaigns and blockades, Linda Spong and Bobbi Hunter were instrumental. The acquisition and outfitting of the Rainbow Warrior ship were handled by Susi Newborn and Denise Bell. The name "Rainbow Warrior" is derived from a prophecy concerning protectors of the Earth from all over the world.

In the course of nuclear protests, Ann-Marie Horne and Mary Lornie were responsible for documenting assaults by the French.
