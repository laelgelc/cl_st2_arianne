In Manaus, Brazil, the urban Indigenous neighborhood of Parque das Tribos is home to 750 families from over 30 different ethnic groups. Founded in 2014, the community faces significant challenges, including poverty, racism, and a lack of infrastructure.

The hunger crisis brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic spurred community-led initiatives to address these struggles. One such effort is the Boca da Mata communal kitchen, started by Renata Peixe-Boi. This kitchen provides residents with fresh meals that are also culturally symbolic. Beyond providing food, the initiative empowers migrant women and helps reconnect youth with their Indigenous languages and traditions.

Another community leader, Claudia Baré, is planning a school for the neighborhood. The school’s purpose is to affirm the identities of Indigenous children, combat prejudice, and offer a safe environment that protects them from crime.

These efforts within Parque das Tribos prioritize inclusion, justice, and collective well-being over profit. Through their actions, the community is building and inspiring alternative futures.
