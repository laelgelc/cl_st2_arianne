The fires escalating in Brazil's Amazon are the worst in a decade. This crisis is exacerbated by government policies that weaken environmental enforcement and enable the expansion of agribusiness and mining.

Indigenous Peoples are facing threats from land invasions and the COVID-19 pandemic, with over 34,000 cases and 837 deaths recorded. The ongoing destruction of the Amazon risks not only biodiversity but also climate stability and regional rainfall. As the forest burns, it releases vast amounts of stored carbon, contributing to a vicious cycle.

This devastation extends beyond the Amazon, with fires also ravaging the Cerrado and Pantanal biomes. The primary drivers of this destruction are cattle ranching, which accounts for 80% of Amazon deforestation, and soy production for livestock feed. Collective action is needed to protect these biomes and the rights of Indigenous Peoples.
