For too long, the shipping industry's climate-polluting emissions have evaded strict regulations. Due to lobbying efforts and a lack of scrutiny, this sector's contribution to the climate crisis has gone unchecked. The scale of the problem is immense; if shipping were a country, its emissions would be equivalent to one of the world's top polluters.

A key opportunity to change this is fast approaching. This April, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) will meet in London. On the agenda is the chance to adopt a high-ambition plan to phase out the industry’s emissions by 2050. Greenpeace is collaborating with other NGOs to push for this outcome.

While divisions exist among the IMO’s member states, the solutions needed to clean up the industry are available now. These include measures like slower shipping speeds, a transition to carbon-free fuels, and the implementation of wind-assisted propulsion.

Achieving a strong agreement at the IMO is crucial for meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement. We need a wave of public support to ensure governments and corporate interests adopt a plan for cleaner shipping. You can help by sharing our Facebook page.
