On June 3, Greenpeace is calling for a global day of action to oppose deep sea mining. This comes ahead of a meeting of governments at the International Seabed Authority in Jamaica. We urge people to join the events, which can be found via a provided map. This effort is similar to the fight to prevent offshore oil drilling to avert climate crises.

A failure to agree on ocean protection has left the door open for the deep sea mining industry to potentially begin this year. We must stop it to safeguard ecosystems, combat neocolonialism, and counter greenwashing. The risks of this industry include the loss of deep sea species, the disturbance of carbon sinks, and negative impacts on Pacific communities.

Please help by sharing our video. We can also use World Oceans Day on June 8 to build on the momentum of the Global Ocean Treaty in our fight against deep sea mining.
