On June 3, join a global day of action to oppose deep sea mining. This call comes ahead of a crucial meeting of the International Seabed Authority in Jamaica, where a decision will be made on whether to allow this destructive industry to proceed.

We are urging people to join events, which can be found via an interactive map, and demand that governments stop deep sea mining before it can even begin. Just as we must prevent new offshore oil drilling to avert climate crises and oil spills, we must stop this new threat to our planet.

If an agreement to halt deep sea mining is not reached, the industry could be free to plunder the seabed. This would put deep sea species and vital carbon sinks at risk. It also threatens the cultural ties that Pacific communities have with the ocean. This is a fight against neocolonialism and greenwashing.

Help us build on the momentum of the new Global Ocean Treaty to achieve broader protection for our oceans. As we approach World Oceans Day on June 8, let's raise our voices together. We encourage you to share the video and spread the word.
