Born in Pennsylvania in 1907, Rachel Carson developed a love for nature and writing from an early age. She authored a series of ocean-themed books, including *Under the Sea Wind* (1941), *The Sea Around Us* (1951), and *The Edge of the Sea* (1955). These works earned her awards and enabled her to leave her government job to become a full-time writer.

Inspired by the harm that DDT caused to birds, Carson began researching pesticides. Her work culminated in the 1962 book *Silent Spring*, which documented the environmental and health impacts of these chemicals. In response, she faced attacks, smears, and lawsuits from the chemical industry.

Despite this opposition, the book raised public awareness and inspired policy changes, such as the formation of the EPA. *Silent Spring* is credited with launching the modern environmental movement. Carson undertook this work while battling cancer, a fight she continued until her death in 1964.
