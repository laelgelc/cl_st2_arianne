The fight for LGBT rights and the fight for climate justice intersect, as various forms of oppression are linked. To build a just society, advocacy must address multiple, overlapping identities.

Personal stories from LGBT survivors of Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines demonstrate this connection. Arthur, for instance, overcame discrimination to become a leader in the relief efforts. Nityalila, a musician, now uses her voice to raise awareness; she came out as a member of the LGBT community after personally facing the impacts of the climate crisis. Another survivor, Pierce, came to understand intersectionality and privilege after witnessing the horrific experiences of others.

Contributors like Edwin Nichols emphasize the power of community in these struggles. He draws parallels to the Stonewall riots, highlighting the need for solidarity to fight against both discrimination and the escalating climate crises.
