Oreo's "Wonderfilled" slogan is supported by videos, TV campaigns, and a song. However, its maker, Mondelez, sources palm oil from Wilmar, which is the world's largest and dirtiest palm oil trader. Wilmar is linked to forest destruction and human rights abuses in Indonesia.

Countries including Italy, Japan, France, and Indonesia are recognizing that the companies producing palm oil for Oreo cookies are trashing rainforests. To expose this, Greenpeace volunteers have held protests worldwide. Over a million people have signed a petition that urges Oreo to stop buying from forest destroyers. You can join them to protect forests and the lives that depend on them.
