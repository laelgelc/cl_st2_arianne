In 2009, Typhoon Ketsana flooded the home of Virginia from San Mateo, Philippines. The storm destroyed her belongings and caused lasting trauma, though she considers herself fortunate compared to those who lost loved ones.

This experience led her to organize a petition to the Philippine Human Rights Commission. The commission ultimately found fossil fuel companies to be morally and legally liable for climate damage, concluding that they had misled the public and blocked clean energy.

Now a Greenpeace climate campaigner, Virginia works with impacted communities that are experiencing crop losses, reduced catches, and income cuts. She is currently aboard the Arctic Sunrise, participating in an action to block Shell. Her demand is that the company stop drilling and start paying for the injustice borne by the people who are least responsible for the climate crisis.
