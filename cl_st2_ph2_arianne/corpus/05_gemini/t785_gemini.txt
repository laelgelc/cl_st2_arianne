James (Jon) Castle (1950-2018) was a legendary Greenpeace captain, renowned for his maritime skills, courage, and integrity. His actions were consistently guided by his principles of right and wrong.

As a skipper, he led ships in critical campaigns against whaling and French nuclear testing in the Pacific. In 1995, he was at the forefront of the campaign against Shell's planned disposal of the Brent Spar oil tank, leading occupations that sparked global protests. These actions resulted in significant policy changes, including a ban on dumping in the North Sea.

Castle advocated for an activism built on moral courage, self-reflection, and resistance to corporatism. His commitment to protest extended to his participation in the Diego Garcia invasion. Later in his life, he helped run a soup kitchen. Those who worked alongside him remember him as a compassionate and inspiring individual.
