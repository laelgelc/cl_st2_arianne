Logical and moral arguments alone have proven insufficient to end great injustices, including the ongoing ecological devastation of our planet. This is because powerful elites benefit from these systems and actively deny truths. A clear example is the denial of climate change, a campaign often funded by the fossil fuel industry itself.

When faced with such entrenched power, non-violent direct action is a necessary tool to create a truthful narrative. History has shown this to be effective. The movements led by Gandhi and Mandela, as well as the long-standing resistance of the Quakers, demonstrate how peaceful action can expose deceit. This is the same deceit we see from corporations like Chevron and Monsanto.

From this history, we can learn the core tactics available to the powerless: leveraging moral truth, embracing creativity, and committing to peaceful resistance. This is a tradition that continues in the environmental movement. It was seen in 1975 when Greenpeace activists confronted whaling fleets on the open ocean. We see it today in the disruptions organized by Extinction Rebellion and in the school strikes initiated by Greta Thunberg. This power of collective action was powerfully demonstrated by the Global Climate Strike, which successfully mobilized millions of people around the world.
