Russia is currently facing a series of environmental crises, including a significant diesel spill in the Arctic, intensifying wildfires in Siberia, and climate-driven heating in the Arctic region caused by fossil fuels.

The company Norilsk Nickel, which controls the area of the diesel spill, is restricting access and the flow of information regarding the disaster. It has also blocked efforts to gather independent pollution data. Satellite imagery has shown rivers with unnatural colors, raising concerns that the contamination could reach the Arctic Ocean.

In an effort to investigate, Greenpeace and journalists collected samples from both the diesel spill and a separate incident involving wastewater dumping at the Talnakh factory. However, authorities at the company-owned airport seized or blocked these samples. Addressing environmental disasters like these, as well as the broader climate crisis, requires transparency.
