On the International Day of Awareness of Food Loss and Waste, we must confront a broken system. While global hunger is on the rise, over 30% of the world's food is lost or wasted. In 2019, 690 million people were hungry, and the COVID-19 pandemic has only made things worse through labor shortages, restricted access to markets, and widespread economic fragility.

This waste is not just a social tragedy; it's an environmental disaster. It drives deforestation, consumes precious water resources, and generates 8% of global greenhouse gas emissions. The problem is rooted in an industrial food system built on long supply chains and artificially low prices that disconnect us from our food and the people who grow it.

Solutions exist at every level. As individuals, we can plan meals and buy from local producers. But to fix the system, we need bigger changes. We must relocalize food production, establish fair pricing, and shift to ecological farming methods that work with nature, not against it. The 2021 UN Food System Summit is a critical moment to demand a transformation of our food system, one that delivers food justice and food sovereignty for people and the planet.
