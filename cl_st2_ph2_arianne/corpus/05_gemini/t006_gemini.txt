During climate crises, LGBTQIA2S+ individuals face disproportionate discrimination, which worsens existing inequalities in housing, healthcare, and access to resources.

LGBTQIA2S+ people experience higher rates of homelessness. In the US, they have a 120% greater risk of homelessness. Furthermore, LGBTQIA2S+ youth make up 40% of the homeless youth population, a situation that is even worse for BIPOC individuals. This community is also more vulnerable to pollution and disasters. For example, during Hurricane Katrina, transgender people were denied entry to shelters, and one individual was jailed. Similarly, following the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, Aravanis were excluded from aid.

The queer and climate movements are interconnected, and unity is essential for the well-being of both people and the planet. Greenpeace is committed to fighting for all people. The green stripe in the rainbow flag represents nature, highlighting this connection.
