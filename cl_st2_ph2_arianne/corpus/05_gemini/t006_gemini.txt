LGBTQIA2S+ individuals face disproportionate discrimination and impacts from climate crises, which emphasizes the interconnectedness of the queer and climate movements for collective action.

Higher rates of homelessness exist among LGBTQIA2S+ people, especially among BIPOC individuals. This can lead to them residing in polluted, disaster-prone areas and facing barriers to receiving aid. For example, during Hurricane Katrina, some trans individuals were denied access to shelters or were jailed. After the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, Aravanis were excluded from relief efforts.

Greenpeace advocates for fighting for nature and for all people, regardless of their identity.
