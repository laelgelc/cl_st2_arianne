Gender Day at the global climate talks highlights the critical link between feminism and environmentalism as a pathway out of the crisis. Climate change disproportionately affects women, particularly those in poverty, due to their dependence on resources and unequal participation in decision-making.

A fair energy transition is necessary, and it requires the inclusion of gender perspectives, the creation of inclusive policies, and the active involvement of women. Last year's Gender Action Plan is advancing this goal, with events at COP24 providing support.

Women are leaders in sustainable practices, resource management, and politics. Their involvement fosters equality, democracy, and the well-being of communities within a renewable energy system.
