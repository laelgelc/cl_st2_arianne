The 2020 MV Wakashio oil spill in Mauritius was a disaster that saw 1,000 tonnes of fuel leak into a lagoon near a marine reserve, causing harm to local communities and marine life. Such events highlight the urgent need to ban the use of dangerous fuels in fragile areas like the Arctic and to transition the shipping industry away from fossil fuels.

However, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) has backtracked on its 2018 commitments to reduce emissions in line with the Paris Agreement. The shipping industry is responsible for 1 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent emissions annually—more than double the emissions of the entire UK—yet the IMO is ignoring the climate emergency.

To address this, a strong Global Ocean Treaty in 2021 is needed. Such a treaty would enhance governance and accountability, ensuring that the conservation of our oceans is prioritized over their exploitation.
