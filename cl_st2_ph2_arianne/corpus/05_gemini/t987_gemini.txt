Despite a massive expansion of protected areas since 1965, the loss of terrestrial and marine species continues to accelerate. According to authors Mora and Sale, many of these designated zones are merely “paper parks,” rendered ineffective by a host of persistent threats.

These protected areas often fail due to poor management, poaching, ongoing development, and pollution. Critically, global warming is a threat that transcends any drawn boundary, impacting ecosystems regardless of their protected status. The core issue is that ecosystems are dynamic and interconnected systems. Simply creating isolated protections is not enough.

This reality demands systemic solutions that look beyond isolated conservation efforts. Such solutions must include limiting human population growth and consumption. Even with current environmental efforts, biodiversity is plummeting. We must urgently shift our approach to one that embraces the complexity of nature and is prepared to enforce broader, more fundamental changes.
