My childhood memories are filled with Cameroon's forests. I remember playing there, collecting fruits and herbs, and finding a sense of peace. My birthday even falls on the International Day of Forests. Now, as a Greenpeace Africa campaigner, I fight against the destruction of these forests for monoculture plantations.

This destruction releases carbon and endangers communities and species. These plantations can never replace the biodiversity and medicinal value of a natural forest. I am critical of the greenwashing by industries that use artificial plantings to offset their emissions.

It is crucial that we recognize Indigenous rights and include Indigenous peoples in policymaking. I lament the displacement of communities, the local climate changes, and the loss of harmony that has resulted from logging. This logging benefits only a few outsiders.
