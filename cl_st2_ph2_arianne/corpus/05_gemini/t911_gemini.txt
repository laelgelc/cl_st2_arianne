As melting Arctic ice, a direct result of climate change, opens up the region, oil companies and fishing fleets are able to move in and exploit it. The ecosystem around Svalbard is particularly at risk from destructive fishing practices.

Bottom trawlers are a major threat, destroying species that live on the seabed like sea pens and corals. This activity runs the risk of eradicating species that have not yet even been discovered. At the same time, bycatch from fishing operations harms near-threatened species such as the Greenland shark. Discarded plastic fishing gear creates another hazard, entangling polar bears.

The impact extends beyond physical harm. Underwater noise from vessels disrupts narwhals and beluga whales, affecting their ability to communicate and breed. The fishing fleets also reduce the amount of food available for walruses. This adds to the stress these animals already experience from the loss of sea ice, demonstrating how these pressures compound in an interconnected ecosystem. We must urge the Norwegian government to protect Svalbard from this destructive fishing.
