In Berlin, 18,000 people have protested against an industrial agriculture system reliant on pesticides, pollution, and genetic engineering. The demonstration also targeted land grabbing, the mistreatment of animals, and the control of our food.

According to Dirk Zimmermann, Greenpeace Germany's senior food campaigner, this seventh annual demonstration is one of the largest of its kind in Europe and is a reflection of global demands for change.

A Greenpeace study shows that Germany can achieve a fully ecological agricultural system by 2050. This system would be capable of feeding 76 million people with high-quality, mostly domestic food. To make this a reality, certain political measures are required, such as redirecting subsidies and improving conditions for livestock.

The transformation also depends on personal actions. These include halving meat consumption and production to reduce environmental harm, cutting food waste by 50%, and ensuring that farmers receive fair prices.
