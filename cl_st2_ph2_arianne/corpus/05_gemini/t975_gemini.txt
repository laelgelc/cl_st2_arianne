Global support is surging for the Arctic 30—the Greenpeace activists, journalists, and crew arrested by Russia. They were detained during a peaceful protest against Gazprom's Arctic oil platform.

In response to the arrests, families have launched petitions, websites, and pickets to campaign for their release. Support has come from Nobel laureates and leaders such as Angela Merkel and Hillary Clinton. Organizations have also sent 1.5 million emails, and a million signatures have been gathered to support the activists. The Netherlands is actively seeking their release through the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea.

The Arctic 30 are being framed as heroes participating in a history of non-violent resistance. Russia's actions are being criticized as an overreaction, with the charges of piracy and hooliganism viewed as frivolous. This situation may ultimately bolster the climate movement.
