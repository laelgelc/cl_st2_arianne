Environmental successes like the Montreal Protocol, which has been instrumental in the recovery of the ozone layer, exist, but overall progress is insufficient against today's escalating crises.

The 2017 "World Scientists’ Warning to Humanity" highlights several declines since 1992. Available freshwater has decreased by 26%, and sustainable fisheries have fallen by 6.4%. In that time, ocean dead zones have increased by 75%, while forest land has been reduced by 2.8%. The warning also notes a 28.9% decline in vertebrate biodiversity. Other trends include a 62% rise in CO2 emissions since 1960, a 35% increase in human population, and a decline in soil productivity.

Based on these findings, major actions are being urged. These include expanding reserves, restoring ecosystems, and reducing waste and population growth. A shift in diets, divestment from fossil fuels, and a revision of economies for sustainability are also called for. These recommendations build on historical warnings, from Malthus to modern studies.
