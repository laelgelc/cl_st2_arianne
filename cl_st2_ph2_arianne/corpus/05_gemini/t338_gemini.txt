As meat consumption continues to decline in Europe, the meat and dairy industries are using advertising to try and reverse the trend. Over a five-year period, the EU spent €252.4 million in public funds promoting these products, an amount greater than the promotional spending for fruits and vegetables.

Campaigns with slogans like “Love pork!” and “Become a beefatarian!” have been financed with this public money, ignoring the associated health, ecological, and animal welfare concerns. This approach contradicts the advice of scientists, who recommend reducing meat and dairy intake. Experts advise this reduction is necessary to protect public health and the planet from the risks of pandemics, climate damage, and the destruction of nature.

Instead of funding these campaigns, public money should be redirected to promote the consumption of fruits and vegetables and to provide support for small-scale, ecological farmers.
