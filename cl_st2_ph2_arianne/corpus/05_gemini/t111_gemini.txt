The Karipuna People, who were reduced to only eight survivors in the 1970s, now number 61. They inhabit 153,000 hectares of demarcated land in Brazil. This territory has suffered massive invasions by land grabbers and loggers, ranking as the ninth most deforested Indigenous land between 2015 and 2021, with 4,700 hectares lost.

In response, thirteen Karipuna, including elders, journeyed to Brasília. There, they delivered a "Cry for Help" letter to ambassadors from eight countries, as well as representatives from the European Union and the United Nations. The letter urges the EU to reject products that come from Amazon deforestation and violate Indigenous rights. It also calls on them to press Brazil to protect the Karipuna territory.

The delegation highlighted that they are facing death threats and the loss of their resources. Chief André stated that exported goods are stained with Indigenous blood. The elders also expressed their fears of being displaced from their land.
