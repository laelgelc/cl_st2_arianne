In Kenya, smallholder farmers are standing against a new, discriminatory law that restricts their ability to exchange or sell Indigenous seeds. These seeds are native to the local farming heritage and are not owned by corporations like Bayer.

Amid a global context of biodiversity loss and mass extinction, Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities are leading the fight to protect our planet. In Kenya, studies show that 90% of seeds originate from informal systems, with 80% of smallholders relying on these very systems for sharing.

Farmers like Petronilah Olunga save seeds due to the high costs of alternatives and question why this traditional practice should be criminalized. The law imposes severe penalties for unregistered seed activities, including up to two years in prison or a fine of KES 1,000,000.

Working in collaboration with groups such as Seed Savers Network and Greenpeace Africa, these farmers are demanding to be consulted. Voiced by Samuel Wathome, their core demand is for the freedom to choose the seeds they plant.
