My path began not in a forest, but as an aerospace engineering student. That trajectory was altered by a series of powerful encounters. I read Rachel Carson’s *Silent Spring* and understood the hidden dangers of pesticides. Then, in 1969, I saw the Cuyahoga River catch fire, a stark symbol of rampant pollution.

These events were given a deeper meaning through the lectures of Gregory Bateson, who taught about the interconnected patterns in nature, asserting that "all divisions are arbitrary." This resonated with the wisdom of Indigenous elders like Fools Crow, who shared the teaching of "Mitakuye-Oyasin"—we are all related. This was a truth I had felt long ago, rooted in a childhood encounter with a magpie that first fostered a sense of kinship with the wild.

These influences reshaped my entire worldview, focusing it on ecology, the nature of complex systems, and the reality of unintended consequences. I came to see the profound need to protect the relational webs that hold the natural world together. This new understanding led me away from engineering and toward journalism. It eventually led to exile in Canada and to the founding of Greenpeace, where we took action to protect whales and the intricate systems they are a part of.
