Progress has been made in the fashion industry's journey toward toxic-free production by 2020. While some brands resisted, initial commitments were secured from Adidas, Puma, and Nike. Today, over 70 brands, which account for 15% of global textile production, have committed to Detox, proving that the goal is feasible.

To measure this progress, the Detox Catwalk ranks 19 companies. H&M, Zara (Inditex), and Benetton are leading the pack as "Detox Avant-Garde" for their work on chemical bans and transparency. However, 16 other brands are lagging in the "Faux Pas" or "Evolution Mode" categories, including Nike and Victoria’s Secret.

We urge faster action from these companies and will continue to reassess their progress. Looking ahead, we are also eyeing sustainable post-growth models for the industry that go beyond mass production.
