Thousands of fish aggregating devices, known as FADs, kill millions of non-target species and devastate marine life to supply companies such as Thai Union. Composed of nets, metal, bamboo, buoys, ribbon, and electronic beacons with batteries, solar panels, LEDs, and circuitry, these devices often become ocean trash or wash up on reefs.

In the Indian Ocean, the crew of the Greenpeace ship Esperanza is recovering and dismantling these FADs. The components are being upcycled into shade shelters, solar-powered lamps for nighttime lighting or for charging devices, and power supplies. Buoys are given to coastal communities for artisanal fishing, and solar panels are provided to village tinkerers through an NGO.
