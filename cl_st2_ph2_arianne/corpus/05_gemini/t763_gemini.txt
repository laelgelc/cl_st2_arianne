Despite a Russian law that bans women from becoming firefighters, courageous women are volunteering with Greenpeace Russia to combat forest fires. This is especially true in regions like Transbaikalia, where pine forests burn quickly. The volunteers face challenging conditions and a rising number of fires due to climate change.

These volunteers, who range from students to individuals nearly 50 years old, balance their firefighting efforts with their daily jobs. They undergo training, and the emphasis is placed on skills rather than gender.

Women like Sofya Kosacheva, Anna Baskakova, and Anastasia Ivashkevich have shared their experiences. They have led expeditions, founded volunteer groups, and proven their capabilities on the front lines. In addition to fighting active fires, their work includes conducting preventive measures, planting trees, and addressing the problem of dry grass burning.
