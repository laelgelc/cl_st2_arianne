Fifteen years have passed since Greenpeace co-founder Bob Hunter's passing on May 2, 2005. His life extended beyond his work with Greenpeace, including early experiences in writing and journalism. He was influenced by ecology, peace movements, and media theorists such as Marshall McLuhan.

Hunter's philosophy was one of non-violent revolution through the use of "mind bombs," which were impactful images designed to raise ecological consciousness. This approach was central to key campaigns, such as protesting nuclear tests and saving whales.

He emphasized spirituality and nature's interconnectedness, viewing ecology as a subversive science. Hunter also shared his personal struggles. After retiring in 1977, he went on to write books and receive awards, securing his legacy.
