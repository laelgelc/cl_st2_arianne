We are facing a global triple crisis of public health, the economy, and our ecology. To navigate this, we need just solutions, starting with unconditional international debt cancellation for the global south to enable a post-COVID recovery.

Debt burdens force countries into extractivist models that cause environmental destruction. Argentina, for example, is facing a potential default on a $65 billion debt. Such pressures stand in the way of a sustainable future.

Freeing up resources is essential for building a just, green future. This future must include zero deforestation, no expansion of fossil fuels or minerals, and the restoration of ecosystems. It is a future where we learn from the ways of Indigenous Peoples.

Greenpeace calls for immediate debt cancellation and for non-debt-creating emergency finance. This will allow countries to prioritize health, wellbeing, and a sustainable economic model for everyone.
