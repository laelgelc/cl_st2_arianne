Net-zero commitments and carbon offsets are critiques as greenwashing tactics. They allow corporations and nations to continue polluting by purchasing credits, a practice that often displaces communities. An alternative, known as "real zero," involves phasing out fossil fuels entirely without relying on offsets, which constitutes genuine climate action.

A Greenpeace poll, which surveyed 2,681 respondents from over 60 countries, found that while there is a low public understanding of these terms, preferences are clear. The poll showed that 93.9% of people prefer a real zero approach over net-zero with offsets. Furthermore, 81.1% of respondents oppose the use of offsets, and 97.8% distrust companies that rely on them.

The public has more trust in activists than in governments and corporations. Following COP26, immediate action is being urged.
