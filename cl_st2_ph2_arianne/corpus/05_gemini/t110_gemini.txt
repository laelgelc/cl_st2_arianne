A recent media story highlighted an outdoor brand founder who pledged all of the company's equity to combat the climate crisis, making Earth the only shareholder. This is a call to choose action, hope, and courage. It points toward a green and fair future built on justice and collaboration, where people and the planet are put before profit.

The climate and biodiversity crises are evident. In response, there are growing global challenges to neo-liberal capitalism. This is especially true among youth, who are linking the economic system to inequality and environmental destruction. The environmental movement is now calling for a focus on addressing these root causes by uniting with other activists and movements.

Hopeful alternatives are being put forward. These include debt cancellation for the Global South, the implementation of progressive taxes, and an end to fossil fuel subsidies. There is also a push to shift our focus beyond GDP to instead prioritize social and environmental well-being. Real changes are already happening in resilient communities that emphasize cooperation, indigenous knowledge, and sovereignty, as well as in the actions of purpose-driven companies.
