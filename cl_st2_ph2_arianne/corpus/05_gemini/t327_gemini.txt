Starbucks Korea has announced it will phase out disposable cups from its cafes by 2025, a move that marks a shift from the company's previously limited environmental efforts. In response, Greenpeace is urging Starbucks to take this commitment global. We are calling on the company to accept reusable cups in all its stores worldwide, launch returnable cup programs in every country of operation, and completely eliminate disposable cups globally by 2025.

The plastic pollution crisis is fueled by billions of throwaway cups, and Starbucks is a major contributor, distributing 6 billion of them annually. The change in South Korea was driven by government policies, including a planned 2027 ban on disposable cups and the implementation of a deposit system in 2022.

While Starbucks paused the use of reusable cups due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it has since resumed accepting them in some regions. However, this policy does not yet extend to North America. It is time for a global transition away from single-use packaging.
