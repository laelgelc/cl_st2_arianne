Elisabeth Stern, from the organisation Swiss Senior Women for Climate Protection, has expressed her outrage at the condemnation faced by young climate activists while fossil fuel profiteers continue to thrive. She highlights the growing pessimism young people feel about adapting to climate change and notes their pleas for intergenerational action.

Stern states that her actions are driven by a concern for future generations rather than her own personal survival, detailing a lifelong commitment that began in 1977. She sees climate litigation as a key tool to hold states and companies accountable. To this end, her group has filed a lawsuit with the European Court of Human Rights. The goal of their legal action is to affirm that climate protection is a human right, a move intended to benefit young people who are facing existential worries.
