Senegalese female fish processors, such as Jaba Diop and Fatou Samba, are urging the government to provide support to local communities. Amid the ongoing health crisis, they are asking for aid to clean their processing sites. This plea comes as the government considers issuing 54 new licenses to destructive Chinese and Turkish industrial vessels that have been implicated in illegal fishing.

These new licenses threaten fish stocks that are already declining and assessed by the FAO as overexploited. This exacerbates food insecurity for 40 million people in West Africa, a situation already worsened by the impacts of COVID-19.

Currently, local artisanal fishing is restricted, with operations limited to just three days a week. In contrast, industrial vessels continue their activities without restriction, harming local livelihoods and the health of the ocean. A petition is calling for support on this issue.
