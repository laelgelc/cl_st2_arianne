Across Europe, cities are taking action to combat air pollution and emissions by prioritising public transport, cycling, and walking over private cars.

In Oslo, the city is improving its cycling infrastructure through the creation of car-free zones and the conversion of car parks into bike lanes. Amsterdam, a city with more bicycles than people, redesigned its streets following protests against traffic fatalities in the 1970s; however, it continues to exceed EU air pollution limits. Copenhagen is a leader with its popular bike lanes and strong encouragement of walking, although its public transport is considered mid-range. Vienna provides affordable public transport, and while Zurich sees high usage of its system, it needs to improve safety for cyclists and pedestrians.

A Greenpeace report that ranks 13 of these cities identifies both leaders and laggards in these efforts. The poorer-performing cities are now facing the possibility of legal action from the European Union.
