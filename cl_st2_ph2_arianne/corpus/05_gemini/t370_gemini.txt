In 2020, as many of us adapted to new security measures and the privilege of remote work, public transport workers played an essential role. They enabled frontline workers, many of whom do not have cars, to get to their destinations.

Our society often overlooks these services, instead placing emphasis on individual transport like cars and flying as symbols of freedom. However, mobility is vital for community care, for sustenance, and for addressing inequality. The experience of COVID-19 has underscored the need to invest in strong public services and to express our gratitude to the people who provide them.

We should appreciate and thank the staff of our public transport systems for keeping our communities running. This includes the drivers, ticket sellers, technicians, operators, cleaners, maintenance crews, and office workers. Especially during the holidays, let's acknowledge their contribution.
