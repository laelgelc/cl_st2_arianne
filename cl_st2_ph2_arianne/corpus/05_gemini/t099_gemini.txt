Greenpeace Brasil, alongside partners Climate Counsel and Observatorio do Clima, and with support from Greenpeace International, has filed a Communication with the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court. The filing requests an investigation into mass human rights abuses committed in the Brazilian Amazon over the past decade, arguing they constitute crimes against humanity.

The evidence presented documents more than 12,000 conflicts in the region. These documented events include 430 murders, 554 attempted murders, and the expulsion of 100,000 people from their land. The communication states that these abuses were orchestrated by a network composed of politicians, public officials, businessmen, and criminals. The purpose of this network was to dispossess people of their land in order to exploit its resources.

The filing also serves as a warning that financial and corporate actors who aid this network could face scrutiny for their role. The communication urges the ICC to act to end the prevailing impunity for these crimes, acknowledging but not being deterred by the resource challenges the Court faces.
