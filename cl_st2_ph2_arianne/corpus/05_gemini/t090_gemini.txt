Our human population has reached 8 billion, and with over half of us living in cities, the urban landscape has a huge impact. Cities produce 70% of CO2 emissions and have the power to drive radical climate transformations.

Over the next 30 years, urban growth will be concentrated in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean. These are regions where cities already face significant social and climate challenges. A justice-centered approach to climate change is essential, one that requires protecting and including marginalized people.

We are gathering voices from individuals in frontline cities who are working to create healthier, greener urban spaces. Urban Justice means addressing inequalities intersectionally. It involves recognizing local solutions to build new models that are centered on both climate and social justice. It is also about grassroots movements pushing for inclusion in decision-making processes.
