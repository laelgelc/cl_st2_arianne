Norway is a country renowned for its natural beauty and respect for the environment, boasting an impressive 97% plastic bottle recycling rate and leading the world in electric car adoption. Paradoxically, it is also the 7th largest exporter of climate-damaging emissions through its oil production.

Despite being a signatory to the Paris Agreement, the Norwegian government and the state-owned oil company Equinor continue to drill for more oil. This directly ignores scientific warnings that we cannot afford to burn more oil, especially as we witness escalating extreme weather events. The world has seen the devastation of Hurricane Dorian and massive wildfires raging in Siberia, the Amazon, and Indonesia.

In response, Greenpeace Nordic and Nature and Youth are appealing a lawsuit against the Norwegian government. The lawsuit argues that continued oil exploration violates Norway's Constitution, specifically Article 112, which guarantees every citizen the right to a healthy environment. To build a stronger case against these fossil fuel projects, we are urging supporters to add their statements.
