Following nine days of intense public pressure from Greenpeace's Detox campaign, Zara, the world's largest clothing retailer, has committed to eliminating all hazardous chemical discharges from its supply chain and products by 2020. This victory was achieved through global actions, social media engagement that included over 43,800 Twitter mentions, and protests at Zara stores.

As part of its commitment, Zara will phase out PFCs by 2015. The company has also agreed to transparency measures, which will see 100 of its suppliers in the Global South begin disclosing their chemical release data by 2013.

Zara now joins other brands like Nike and Adidas in making a commitment to detox their manufacturing processes. The campaign continues, as more companies must act to stop toxic pollution from clothing production.
