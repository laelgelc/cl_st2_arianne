Greenpeace is embarking on a pole-to-pole expedition aboard the ship Esperanza. Our purpose is to expose the threats facing our oceans, confront environmental destruction, and champion solutions for their protection.

The journey will begin in the Arctic, where we will collaborate with scientists to study the impacts of climate change on marine life. As we travel from one pole to the other, we will document a range of critical issues. These include the shrinking sea ice that polar bears depend on, the pervasive plastic pollution in the Sargasso Sea, illegal fishing activities in the South Atlantic, and the risks that deep-sea mining poses to unique ecosystems like the Lost City.

This voyage will highlight the diverse ocean ecosystems and wildlife at risk. It is a part of our #ProtectTheOceans campaign, which is fighting for a strong Global Ocean Treaty. Our goal is to see a third of the world's seas safeguarded by the year 2030.
