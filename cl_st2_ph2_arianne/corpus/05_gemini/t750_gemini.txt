This month marks the fifth anniversary of the Rana Plaza factory collapse in Bangladesh. In this incident, 1,138 workers died while producing clothes for brands including Mango, Primark, and Walmart, which exposed the unsafe conditions within fast fashion.

In response, the Fashion Revolution movement was born, and it is now in its fifth year. Running from April 23-29 in 100 countries, the movement demands a fashion industry that is sustainable, safe, and transparent. Greenpeace has contributed through its Detox My Fashion campaign, which has successfully led 15% of the global textile sector to commit to eliminating hazardous chemicals from their production.

The fashion industry creates significant environmental strains, including water use, the use of chemicals, and microfibre pollution. You can take action by upcycling, swapping clothes, and attending events. You can also watch the film "True Cost," read reports on the issue, and contact brands and politicians. To participate online, you can share the hashtag #whomademyclothes on Instagram.
