A diverse group of Greenpeace’s Antarctic Ambassadors, including artists, actors, scientists, and explorers, are calling for the protection of the Antarctic. They believe we have a shared responsibility to safeguard our planet’s fragile places.

Having explored the depths of the Antarctic Ocean, interacted with its penguin colonies, and engaged with world leaders, these ambassadors are raising awareness that the region urgently needs help. They are advocating for the creation of an Antarctic Ocean Sanctuary. This sanctuary would be the world’s largest protected area, designed to be a safe haven for penguins, whales, and seals who are threatened by climate change, pollution, and overfishing.

The health of our oceans is crucial. They support the carbon cycle, which helps mitigate climate impacts, and they ensure food security for billions of people. What happens in the Antarctic affects everyone, everywhere on the globe.
