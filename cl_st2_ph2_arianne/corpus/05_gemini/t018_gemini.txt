In a victory for Indigenous peoples, HD Hyundai Construction Equipment has pledged to halt the sale of its heavy machinery in the states of Amazonas, Roraima, and Pará. The company will also cease maintenance and the supply of parts in these areas and is terminating a dealership contract. These actions are intended to prevent the company’s excavators from being used to aid illegal gold mining in Kayapó, Munduruku, and Yanomami Indigenous territories.

The decision follows a Greenpeace report that revealed 176 excavators were operating in these areas between 2021 and 2023. Of those machines, 43% were manufactured by HD HCE, making it the most popular brand among illegal miners. The company’s pledge was made after pressure from Greenpeace campaigns, which included press conferences and demonstrations.

While this is a significant step, other manufacturers and the Brazilian government must also take action to eradicate illegal mining.
