From April 24-28, thousands of Indigenous Peoples gathered in Brasília for the 19th annual Free Land Camp to demand government recognition of their lands. This process, known as demarcation, is a constitutional right that serves to protect Indigenous territories from invasions, preserving livelihoods, cultures, and forests.

However, progress is critically slow. Only 30.8% of all claimed Indigenous areas are officially recognized, with 871 out of 1,393 lands still pending government action. This lack of protection leaves territories vulnerable to invasions by loggers and miners. In regions such as the Yanomami, Kayapó, and Munduruku lands, illegal gold mining operations using excavators are causing environmental destruction, mercury contamination, and violence.

The protection of Indigenous land is crucial for maintaining global biodiversity and ensuring climate balance.
