The modern concept of minimalism, as championed by figures like The Minimalists, involves a rejection of consumer-driven lives in pursuit of greater fulfillment. This idea is not new; it has a rich history with influences from St. Francis, the Quakers, Thoreau, Tolstoy, and Gandhi. The work of thinkers such as Arne Naess has inspired significant ecological movements, including Greenpeace and the deep ecology movement.

Key books have also promoted these values. *Diet for a Small Planet*, *Small Is Beautiful*, and *Ecotopia* all advocate for reduced consumption as a means to achieve sustainability. This wisdom stretches back to ancient traditions, where Taoism, Buddhism, the Cynics, and the historical Jesus emphasized the principle of renouncing possessions to live richer lives.

Furthermore, Indigenous practices like the Potlatch highlight the importance of sharing over hoarding. Embracing and promoting modesty provides a path to address profound global challenges, including the climate crisis.
