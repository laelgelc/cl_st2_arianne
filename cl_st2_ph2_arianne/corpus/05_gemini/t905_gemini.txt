As a volunteer deckhand aboard the Greenpeace ship Arctic Sunrise, I am sailing in the Sylt Outer Reef marine sanctuary, located off the coast of Germany. Life at sea means learning new terms; walls are bulkheads and ceilings are deckheads. The constant wobbling of the ship affects daily activities, even in the mess, our dining room, and the galley, which is our kitchen.

Our campaigner, Thilo Maack, explains that while this area is a sanctuary where dumping and drilling are banned to stop ocean exploitation, a destructive practice continues. Industrial bottom trawling is still happening here. This method involves gouging the seabed to catch brown shrimp. However, this process results in up to 80% bycatch, which includes endangered harbor porpoises. These animals are discarded dead. The activity puts a third of the species in this so-called "sanctuary" at risk.
