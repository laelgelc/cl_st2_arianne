For Sámi reindeer herder Katarina Sevä, her family's centuries-old practice of forest reindeer herding is under threat. Extensive logging is shrinking the grazing land and destroying the vital hanging lichen the reindeer depend on. The consequences are clear: the reindeer have poorer antlers, lower body weight, and their behavior is changing.

The state-owned company Sveaskog has, without explanation, ended the long-standing consultations it held with the herders. Now, the company ignores objections and logs important areas, including forests that were previously agreed to be protected. Sveaskog is also building roads without providing maps of their locations.

Demands to resume consultations and preserve the forest have not been met. In response, there is a call to halt all logging in the Muonio Sámi district until these talks can restart. This is necessary to secure the future of reindeer husbandry.
