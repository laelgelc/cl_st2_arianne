Amid confusion and misinformation, a three-part documentary series from THE WHY Foundation, WHY PLASTIC?, is highlighting plastic's role in a major environmental crisis. The series critiques the reliance on recycling and corporate self-regulation as solutions.

One film, "The Recycling Myth," exposes the failures of recycling. It reveals a multi-billion industry connected to waste export, incineration, bribery, fraud, and greenwashing. Another part of the series, "Coca-Cola’s Plastic Promises," uncovers the flaws in the 'World Without Waste' strategy put forward by Coca-Cola, which has been named the top plastic polluter.

The series urges big brands like Coca-Cola to shift from single-use packaging to reuse and refill models. The campaign aims to raise awareness about the plastic crisis, with the goal of reaching over 100 million people worldwide.
