To solve our problems, we need a new way of thinking, as Einstein once noted. A new economy is needed, one that prioritizes people and the environment over profit.

This new system must be founded on key principles. It should be inclusive for everyone. It would champion the sharing of resources through cooperatives and technologies such as Blockchain. There must be a shift in values, where we prioritize experiences over consumerism. To ensure genuine sustainability, we must focus on regeneration and waste reduction. Economic activity needs to be limited through regulations and fair trade. By reducing work hours, people could be allowed more free time, and wealth could be spread through the use of progressive taxes.

Systemic disconnections, which are accelerated by technology, are a critical issue. We have seen the rise of movements like Occupy Wall Street in response. We must also be cautious of sharing economies that have been hijacked. It is crucial that we put forward visions for a hopeful and equitable future.
