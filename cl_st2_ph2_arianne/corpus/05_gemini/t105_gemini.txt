Greenpeace Russia aids firefighters and volunteers in their efforts to combat peat fires, utilizing scientific research and decades of experience. The journey of volunteers like Alexi, who evolved from cleaning garbage in parks to specializing in fire suppression, illustrates this dedication. A comprehensive guide on extinguishing peat fires has been produced and is now available in English. It covers topics such as flooding methods, hydrology, and the application of advanced technologies like UAVs and satellite data.

The majority of wildfires stem from human activities, making prevention a more critical focus than mere response. Peat fires are being worsened by climate change and have significant impacts. They release massive carbon emissions and toxic smoke, can lead to "zombie fires," threaten biodiversity, and ultimately accelerate global warming.
