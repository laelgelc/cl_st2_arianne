Off the coast of Yemen, near the port of Hodeidah, the FSO SAFER sits anchored. This massive tanker holds 1.1 million barrels of oil and has not received maintenance since 2014 because of the ongoing conflict. This is all happening in the midst of the world's worst humanitarian crisis, which affects 24 million people.

The vessel's condition is deteriorating, with recent failures that include flooding, non-functional fire equipment, and a broken inert gas system. These issues raise the risks of a catastrophic spill or an explosion. Such a disaster could be up to four times the scale of the Exxon Valdez spill, and it would devastate the region's fisheries, reefs, and desalination plants. A spill would also severely impact access for humanitarian aid.

Greenpeace urges for UN-led diplomatic efforts to address this threat. It is urgent that these efforts secure an assessment of the tanker, arrange for the transfer of its oil to a safe vessel, and put spill response preparations in place.
