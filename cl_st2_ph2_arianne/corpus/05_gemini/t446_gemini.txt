The COVID-19 crisis exposes fundamental flaws in our socio-economic systems, highlighting both our vulnerability and our interdependence. This reality calls for a green and just transition to resilient practices that function within ecological limits.

Such a transition requires us to rethink production, consumption, work, and more. A way forward is through commons-based models. These include distributed manufacturing, open access licensing, Distributed Cooperative Organizations (DisCOs), platform cooperatives, and farmland trusts.

The commons involve shared resources, the communities that steward them, and the governance rules they establish. We can see this framework in action through examples like Wikipedia, community-supported agriculture, and the open-source responses developed during the pandemic. This movement promotes values of care, openness, collaboration, and abundance. It complements concepts like degrowth and ecofeminism, working towards fairer and more participatory alternatives.
