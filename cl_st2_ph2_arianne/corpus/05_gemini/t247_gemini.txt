Founded in 2011 by Charlene Tan, the Good Food Community is a social enterprise in the Philippines. It utilizes the Community Shared Agriculture (CSA) model to link smallholder organic farmers with consumers in Metro Manila. This connection is facilitated through prepaid subscriptions, which provide for weekly deliveries of fresh produce.

The organization places a strong emphasis on ecological farming practices. This includes farming without toxic chemicals, prioritizing soil care, and encouraging crop diversity. It also promotes regenerative practices as a way to combat climate change and advance food sovereignty.

During the pandemic, the Good Food Community adapted to disrupted supply chains. It provided support to both farmers and hungry communities. The enterprise shifted its focus to online household orders and paused in-person events, such as its Good Food Sundays. Through its work, the initiative builds relationships based on trust and decentralizes resources to support sustainable livelihoods.
