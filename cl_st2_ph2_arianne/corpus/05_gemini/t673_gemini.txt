After eight years of public pressure, European tuna giant Bolton has adopted a progressive sourcing policy. The company, once a laggard in 2011, has now committed that 50% of its tuna will be sourced using selective methods like pole and line or FAD-free purse seining, an increase of 22%.

As part of its new policy, Bolton will cap the number of Fish Aggregating Devices (FADs) at 300, prohibit supply vessels, and work to reduce bycatch. This development follows the landmark commitments made by Thai Union last year, which came in the midst of Greenpeace campaigns addressing the problems of overfishing, bycatch, and labor abuses in the industry.

These changes signal a growing momentum within the industry for the protection of our oceans and workers. This move urges other companies to improve their own practices and highlights the impact that individual actions can have. As we continue our work, Greenpeace calls for the creation of an Antarctic ocean sanctuary.
