Canadian government decisions on declining caribou populations are proving to be outdated and ineffective. In Quebec, the response to the imperiled Val-d’Or herd is to relocate it to a zoo. This is an abdication of responsibilities laid out in recovery plans and under the Species at Risk Act (SARA).

In British Columbia, the government is resorting to wolf culling. This policy targets the symptoms of the caribou’s decline rather than addressing the root cause: widespread habitat destruction stemming from poor forest management.

Despite the existence of SARA strategies and studies that clearly highlight the risks to caribou, little meaningful action has been taken by governments. It is time for an approach that immediately applies science and Indigenous knowledge. Habitat protection must be strengthened, with direct input from First Nations.

Public action is needed to demand that governments implement their own recovery strategies. Through petitions, we can push for the protection necessary to safeguard our boreal forests and the caribou that depend on them.
