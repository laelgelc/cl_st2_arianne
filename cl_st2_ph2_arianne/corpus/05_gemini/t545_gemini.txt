The scientific understanding of our climate has a long history, tracing its roots back to ancient atomic theories. Over time, key figures like Democritus, Fourier, Foote, Tyndall, Arrhenius, and Budyko built the foundations of this science, a history that also includes the overlooked contributions of women scientists.

Early warnings about global heating caused by fossil fuel emissions were sounded decades ago. In the 1960s, reports from organizations including the American Petroleum Institute and Exxon predicted a rise in CO2 and an increase in temperatures. These forecasts proved to be accurate. However, despite decades of international conferences held since 1972, emissions have doubled.

This situation is not the result of scientific shortcomings. The failure to act is attributed to industry deceit, government failures, media cowardice, and societal consumption desires. The significant military role of oil has also been a factor.
