On February 22, 2021, the American poet and founder of City Lights Bookstore, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, died from lung disease at the age of 101. A pacifist with a legacy rooted in the Beat era, Ferlinghetti joined the Greenpeace ship *James Bay* in 1977 during a whale campaign.

During his time on the ship, he wrote a dream-inspired poem in the crew's Dreambook. In it, Moby Dick symbolized the destruction of wild nature by modern technology. This poem was published in *Northwest Ecolog* in 1978. Ferlinghetti also contributed another dream poem, "Rough Song of Animals Dying," to *Greenpeace Chronicles*, which addressed the Greenhouse Effect and species extinction. Through his poetry, he played a role in awakening environmental awareness.
