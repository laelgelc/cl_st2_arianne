The 1945 atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki killed over 214,000 people by the end of that year and caused lasting radiation effects. Later, Eisenhower's 1953 "Atoms for Peace" speech promoted the use of nuclear power. This led Japan to build its first nuclear plant in 1966 and to continue expanding its program despite global incidents such as Three Mile Island and Chernobyl.

In 2011, the Fukushima disaster displaced over 160,000 people, with many still affected today. The author argues that nuclear energy is not peaceful. Japan should abandon it and instead pursue renewable energy to foster peace and development.
