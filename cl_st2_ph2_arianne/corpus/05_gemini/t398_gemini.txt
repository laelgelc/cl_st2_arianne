Footage shows the sea burial of Ari, a 24-year-old Indonesian migrant fisher who died from poor treatment on a Chinese-owned vessel belonging to Dalian Ocean Fishing. Three other fishers also died. The story, which was broken by South Korean broadcaster MBC and went viral online, has sparked more reports of deaths and pleas for rescue from others at sea.

Mobile technology has empowered fishers to document the mistreatment, forced labor, human trafficking, and illegal practices like shark finning that Greenpeace has long worked to uncover. These fishers are now able to capture evidence of these abuses themselves.

The Indonesian government has ignored the problem of modern slavery but has recently taken reactionary steps in response to these events. It is imperative that the government holds agencies, companies, and fleets accountable for their actions through the implementation of better monitoring.
