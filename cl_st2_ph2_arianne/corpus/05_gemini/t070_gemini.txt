The COP15 UN Biodiversity Conference concluded with the Kunming-Montreal Agreement, which has been hailed as historic but is merely a starting point to halt mass extinction.

The agreement recognizes Indigenous Peoples, who protect 80% of the Earth's biodiversity despite making up only 5% of humanity. It emphasizes that respect for their rights, territories, consent, and participation is essential, as per the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Indigenous-led conservation must become the standard.

A key target included in the agreement is the protection of 30% of land and seas by 2030. However, this target lacks exclusions for damaging activities. The agreement also incorporates corporate schemes like nature-based solutions, which risks exploitation.

Finance commitments remain inadequate. Faster action is required, including the establishment of a fund in 2023 for developing countries and Indigenous Peoples. A Global Ocean Treaty is also needed. The work to build on this agreement will continue at COP16, which will be held in Türkiye in 2024.
