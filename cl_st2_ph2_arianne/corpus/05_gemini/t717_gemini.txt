Israel's Energy Minister Yuval Steinitz has announced that the country will eliminate the use of coal and oil by 2030. The plan involves promoting electric vehicles and gas-powered trucks, with electricity to be generated from gas and renewables.

This announcement follows campaigning by Greenpeace Israel against the coal plants in Hadera and Ashkelon. We highlighted the significant health, financial, and climate harms caused by these plants, including their greenhouse gas emissions and the premature deaths they cause.

Rather than settling for the installation of scrubbers, we pushed for the complete shutdown of the plants. Our campaign secured commitments to close the old units by 2022 and to bring an end to coal imports.

While the government's plan includes gas, Greenpeace advocates for a future powered by 100% renewables. We emphasize the need for solar energy to meet the country's Paris Agreement goals and to protect future generations.
