Waya Maweru, a Greenpeace volunteer from Indonesia, has witnessed the devastation of rainforests cleared for palm oil plantations. This destruction endangers species, exploits communities, and has led to crises like the 2015 fires.

In response, she and other activists have boarded a ship owned by Wilmar, which is carrying dirty palm oil to Europe. This protest targets the company's role in ongoing deforestation and human rights abuses. Brands such as Oreo have made promises to use clean palm oil but have not fulfilled them.

Maweru is urging for action to stop any further destruction. She is calling for support to pressure Wilmar and the companies that buy its palm oil to adopt sustainable practices.
