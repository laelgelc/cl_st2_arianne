A Greenpeace expedition on the Rainbow Warrior in the Philippines' Verde Islands has revealed plastic pollution affecting even the smallest marine life.

Nestlé is one of the world's worst plastic polluters, ranking third globally. The company uses 1.7 million tonnes of plastic every year, a figure that has increased by 5% over the last five years. Of this, 98% is for single-use packaging.

We are urging Nestlé to take responsibility for the "plastic monster" it has created. The company must phase out single-use plastics and invest in systems based on refill and reuse.

As part of the #BreakFreeFromPlastic movement, activists delivered a plastic monster to Unilever in Rotterdam and are now sailing the Rhine River on the Beluga to confront Nestlé. While Nestlé has acknowledged that recycling alone is not enough to solve the plastic crisis, it is failing to take the urgent action required.
