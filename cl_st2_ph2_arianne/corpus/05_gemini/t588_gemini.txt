In 2018, the removal of Amsterdam's iconic 'Iamsterdam' sign shocked tourists and locals, drawing global media attention. A parallel can be drawn to the disappearing Amazon rainforest. The sign has been repurposed as 'Iamazonia' to highlight deforestation and to express solidarity with the Indigenous Peoples who have long protected the forest and depend on it for their survival.

Brazil's Bolsonaro government has been criticized for promoting industrial exploitation of the region through agriculture, mining, and logging. These policies have led to increased invasions of Indigenous lands and violence against their communities. The destruction of the Amazon also creates significant global climate risks. It is a vital planetary landmark that requires worldwide support to be safeguarded.
