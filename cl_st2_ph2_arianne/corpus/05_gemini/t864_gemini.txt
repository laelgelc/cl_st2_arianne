We launched a petition urging Samsung to reuse or recycle the valuable materials inside the 4.3 million Galaxy Note7 phones it recalled. The story has since gained global media attention, and more than 25,000 people have signed the petition.

In response, Samsung has acknowledged the concerns and stated that it is reviewing options to minimize the environmental impact of the phones. However, the company has not yet shared any public plans for what it will do.

Now is the time to increase the pressure. We are asking you to phone Samsung and ask what its plans are for the phones. Ask if they will be recycling or reusing the components. If they do not have any plans, ask them for a timeline of when they will be announced.

Please share the responses you get on social media using the hashtag #SaveTheGalaxy. Together, we can encourage a fundamental rethinking of how phones are designed, produced, and what happens to their materials.
