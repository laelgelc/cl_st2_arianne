In late October, governments are set to meet in Hobart, Australia, to decide on the creation of a vast Antarctic Ocean Sanctuary in the Weddell Sea. This sanctuary would span nearly two million square kilometers, making it the largest protected area on Earth. There are also additional proposals to establish a network of sanctuaries.

The meeting is run by CCAMLR, which is composed of 24 countries plus the EU. Any decision requires consensus, meaning a single objection has the power to block or weaken the sanctuary proposed by the EU.

The sanctuary would restrict industrial fishing. This would protect wildlife like whales and penguins, which face global threats including pollution and climate change. It would also preserve the Antarctic, which is a key carbon store.

Over two million people support the creation of the sanctuary, presenting a major opportunity for ocean protection.
