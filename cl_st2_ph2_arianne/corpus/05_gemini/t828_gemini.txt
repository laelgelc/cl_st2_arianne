Our campaign is targeting Thai Union, the world's largest canned tuna company, to reform a destructive seafood industry. This industry is plagued by forced labor, illegal fishing, ocean destruction, and untraceable supply chains.

After two years of pressure from activists and consumers, Thai Union is now engaging with Greenpeace. The company is considering major changes, including reducing destructive fishing, minimizing labor abuse, tackling illegal fishing and overfishing, and ensuring full traceability. Such shifts could force improvements across the entire industry.

To urge immediate and sweeping reforms, a video has been released featuring internet cats, mermaids, sharks, turtles, and activists. Thai Union owns brands like Chicken of the Sea and supplies major retailers such as Walmart. We are calling on all supporters to demand action.
