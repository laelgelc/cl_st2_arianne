On May 18, 2016, the Norwegian government granted new Arctic drilling licenses to 13 oil companies. The country’s petroleum minister celebrated the move as a "new chapter," even as the industry faces significant setbacks such as Shell's withdrawal from the region, halved Norwegian oil production, and plummeting oil prices.

This decision to expand Arctic drilling directly contradicts the global warming limits set by the recent Paris Agreement. It also runs counter to a sustainability deal on the Arctic made between Norway and the US. The perspective of some industry leaders was highlighted by Chevron's CEO, who views global warming as beneficial for gas production.

In response, civil society groups, including Greenpeace, are seeking a constitutional review of the new licenses, citing environmental rights. This challenge could potentially lead to court action, offering hope for a future that prioritizes a shift to renewables over the expansion of Arctic oil.
