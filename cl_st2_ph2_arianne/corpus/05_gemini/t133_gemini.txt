Psychologist Dr. Susie Burke discusses how to manage uncomfortable feelings about existential threats such as the climate crisis. She emphasizes that these feelings are appropriate and can serve as motivation for action.

Drawing from Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, the advice is to notice, name, and make room for emotions like fear or grief. There are several strategies to help. One is to complete the stress cycle, which can be done through physical activity, crying, conversations, spending time in nature, or hugs. Another strategy involves practicing present-moment grounding exercises, such as noticing what you can see, hear, and feel.

Acting on your core values can also reduce feelings of helplessness. This includes taking part in efforts to curb our reliance on fossil fuels. Finally, cultivating hope and raising our expectations for solutions are important, as they help to foster both personal and collective impact.
