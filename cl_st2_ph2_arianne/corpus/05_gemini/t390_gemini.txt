The logging season has begun in Germany, placing forests like Dannenroder, or Danni, under threat from a planned highway expansion. In the nearby Herren and Maulbacher forests, evictions and brutal tree cutting have already occurred, and the chainsaws are now approaching Danni.

This project is a moment of deep hypocrisy amid a climate crisis and mass extinction. It involves destroying ancient trees, the habitats of endangered species, and a water reserve, all to promote more polluting cars.

In an act of resistance, activists have built treehouse villages to protect the forest, but they are now facing police evictions. As this happens, hundreds of people are mobilizing for climate justice.
