Our three-month voyage began with the immense task of provisioning food for 25 people. We made stops in Curacao and Panama to load up on fresh ingredients, which then had to be unpacked and stored for the journey ahead. As someone from Taiwan and new to life at sea, this was the start of many new experiences for me.

One of the first challenges I faced was seasickness. I learned that getting fresh air and using breathing techniques helped, and I also took pills. Our onboard medic, Loes, was a great help, and I found that avoiding caffeine also made a difference. The challenges aren't just personal; big waves have caused chaos in the kitchen as things fall over, and they have also disrupted sleep on our bunk beds.

Despite the rolling conditions, life onboard continues. Our French chef, Laurence, prepares healthy meals, and volunteers assist in the galley. This work carries on even when the ship is moving, and it includes tasks like sorting our waste.
