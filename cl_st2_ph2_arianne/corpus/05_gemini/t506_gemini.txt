In the fishing industry, modern slavery is a harsh reality, particularly for migrant workers from Indonesia and the Philippines. Media has exposed the inhumane conditions these workers face. A key practice enabling this exploitation is transshipment, which allows vessels to remain at sea for prolonged periods. This isolation facilitates forced labor and exploitation, while governments are criticized for their failure to protect these vulnerable workers.

Greenpeace Southeast Asia's report, “Seabound: The Journey to Modern Slavery on the High Seas,” sheds light on this crisis through the direct testimonials of fishers. Their stories reveal a pattern of deceptive recruitment agencies and the economic desperation that drives them to seek this work. Many face language barriers, signing contracts they cannot understand. The report also highlights how overfishing has pushed fleets into distant water fishing, exacerbating these exploitative conditions.

On Human Rights Day, there is an urgent call for ASEAN states to take action. They must enforce existing laws, address the discrimination faced by migrant fishers, and actively promote ethical practices throughout the industry.
