Climate injustice means that those least responsible for creating cumulative greenhouse gas emissions are the ones who suffer most from the effects of climate change, such as heat waves, droughts, and storms.

The disparities are significant. The United States is accountable for over 25% of emissions since the 1750s, whereas the entire continent of Africa is responsible for only 3%. From 1990 to 2015, the wealthiest 5% of the global population caused 36% of emissions. During that same period, the poorest half of the world's population contributed less than 6%. At the corporate level, just twenty companies are linked to over one-third of recent emissions.

This reality poses existential threats to vulnerable regions like small islands and sub-Saharan Africa. There is a call for accountability, for financial aid from wealthy nations, and for justice-focused policies to be central at events such as the Glasgow conference.
