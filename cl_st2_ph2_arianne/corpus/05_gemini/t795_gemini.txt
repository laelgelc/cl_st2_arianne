Our 2017 radiation survey in Fukushima's contaminated areas has exposed the ineffective reality of the official decontamination program. In places like Iitate and Namie, efforts have failed, with recontamination occurring from the surrounding forests that have not been cleaned.

This flawed approach is generating a vast nuclear waste crisis. The program is projected to create 30 million cubic meters of waste, which is currently being stored at over 141,000 different sites. Massive transports are now underway to move this waste to interim storage facilities in the towns of Okuma and Futaba.

Amid these ongoing radiological risks, the government is pressuring evacuees to return to their homes. This policy ignores the dangers and is compounded by the exploitation of workers involved in the cleanup and the high financial costs of the entire program.

We urge the government to accept the recommendations of the United Nations Human Rights Council. It is critical to provide better support for all affected citizens, especially for the most vulnerable groups, including women and children.
