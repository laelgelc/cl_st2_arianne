This is a victory for activists, petitioners, and supporters across the globe. Together, we forced Shell to abandon its plans for Arctic drilling. Through protests, petitions, and relentless public pressure, you turned a corporate story into global headlines, demonstrating the undeniable power of people over profits.

Shell itself cited the high costs of its venture, having spent over $7 billion, along with insufficient oil finds. The company also acknowledged the challenging regulatory environment that resulted from worldwide opposition to its plans. It could not ignore the immense risks involved, including a 75% chance of oil spills in this fragile environment. The environmental threats were severe, risking the acceleration of Arctic melting, the displacement of communities, and irreparable harm to wildlife.

While we celebrate this win, the fight continues. Our goal is to secure permanent protection for the Arctic against all oil companies.
