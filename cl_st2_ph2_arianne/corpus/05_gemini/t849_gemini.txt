While synthetic fibers offer some environmental benefits, such as using less water than cotton and avoiding toxic pesticides, they are a major contributor to microplastic pollution. According to a report by the IUCN, 15-31% of plastic pollution in our oceans comes from primary microplastics released from household and industrial products. Of that amount, 35% originates from the washing of synthetic textiles.

The scale of this pollution is immense. In Europe and Central Asia, the volume of microplastics released into the environment is equivalent to 54 plastic bags per person every week. Polyester, which is now found in 60% of all clothes, has a significant climate impact, with CO2 emissions three times higher than those of cotton. A single wash of a polyester garment can release 700,000 microfibers, which then enter our oceans and the food chain.

Solutions to this crisis involve rethinking clothing production to focus on durability and recyclability. For consumers, the most effective actions are to buy less clothing and to opt for secondhand or upcycled items when possible.
