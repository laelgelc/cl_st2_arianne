At COP24 in Poland, Greenpeace campaigner Kelvin Anthony is representing Pacific nations with a clear message for Australia: end the country’s dependency on coal. Amid accelerating climate change, he highlights a lack of leadership from high-polluting countries, which are driven by profits. This inaction is leading to severe weather and rising seas, threatening the very livelihoods and cultures of Pacific islands.

Despite contributing minimally to the emissions causing this crisis, Pacific communities are facing existential risks. They are advocating for a rapid and just transition to renewable energy. Drawing hope from his daughter’s future, Anthony’s mission is to amplify the voices of those on the frontlines, call out hypocrisy, and demand global action.
