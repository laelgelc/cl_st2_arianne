Antarctic krill are tiny, alien-like creatures that are vital to the food web of the Antarctic Ocean. They serve as a crucial source of prey for an array of wildlife, including penguins, seabirds, seals, and fish. Migrating whales, such as blue and humpback whales, also depend on them for food.

These creatures exhibit remarkable characteristics. They are bioluminescent and can form massive swarms with densities of up to 30,000 individuals per cubic meter. Krill have developed unique survival strategies; they can moult their shells to evade predators and are even able to shrink in size to conserve energy.

In addition to their role in the ecosystem, krill are climate heroes. They contribute to the carbon cycle by capturing carbon and depositing it on the seafloor.

However, this critical species is threatened by industrial fishing. Krill are harvested to produce Omega-3 pills and fish food. In response to this threat, there are calls for the creation of the world's largest ocean sanctuary to provide protection for the Antarctic.
