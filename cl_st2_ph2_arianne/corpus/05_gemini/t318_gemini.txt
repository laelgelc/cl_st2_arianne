Our ship, the Rainbow Warrior, has sailed to the Clarion Clipperton Zone in the Pacific. We are here to witness and expose the risks of deep sea mining being pushed by companies such as The Metals Company and GSR.

During tests, we observed GSR's 25-tonne prototype mining machine disconnect from its vessel and become stuck on the seabed. We have also seen sediment clouds created by the disturbance of the seafloor.

Activists are on site protesting the industry's threats. Victor Pickering, an activist from Fiji, is among those highlighting the dangers deep sea mining poses to ocean wildlife, the livelihoods of people in the Pacific, and the ocean's ability to store carbon amid the ongoing climate change crisis. To highlight the dangers, Greenpeace painted "RISK" on the side of GSR's vessel.

We are calling for a Global Ocean Treaty that can create ocean sanctuaries, putting them off-limits to destructive industries. We urge millions of people to join the growing opposition to deep sea mining.
