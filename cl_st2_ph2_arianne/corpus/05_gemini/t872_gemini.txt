Greenpeace and Nature and Youth have filed a lawsuit in Oslo to challenge Norway's 23rd licensing round. This round granted oil companies, including Statoil, licenses for drilling in the Arctic. The lawsuit argues that this contradicts the Paris climate agreement and the environmental protections guaranteed by Norway's constitution.

The case seeks to halt exploratory wells, ensure the oil remains in the ground, and safeguard the Arctic for future generations. A group of supporters, known as 'Friends of the Case,' has formed, consisting of scientists, activists, and Indigenous leaders. Notable supporters include James Hansen, Bill McKibben, and Bunna Lawrie. Global supporters are urged to add their names to demonstrate worldwide concern.
