The year 2020 served as a major disruption, exposing a broken global system. Lagi Toribau reflects on this system as one that favors competition, power, and inequality over collaboration and human life. Drawing from his own Fijian upbringing in communal structures, he puts forward that a change in mindset is what is needed to enable societal transformation.

He envisions a different world, one without biases, categorizations, or competition. In this world, the universal currencies would be happiness and health, and humans would live in harmony with nature. The COVID-19 pandemic has starkly revealed the vulnerabilities of our current systems, creating an urgent need to expand security, equity, and environmental protection for all.

This reflection also addresses the crisis of systemic racism, inspired by the murder of George Floyd and the Black Lives Matter movement. In the face of these interconnected challenges, the importance of individual choices in creating a more just world is emphasized.
