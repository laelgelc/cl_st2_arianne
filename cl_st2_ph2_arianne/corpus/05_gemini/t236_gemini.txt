Greenpeace criticizes the COP26 climate summit for boosting carbon offsetting scams. These schemes endanger Indigenous Peoples, biodiversity, and the critical 1.5°C climate goal. The benefits they claim are often unverifiable and result in land grabbing and the displacement of communities.

This greenwashing is widespread. Examples include airlines that offset flights through forest protection projects, and TotalEnergies planning to drill for oil in the Congo's peatlands while compensating with farms of non-native trees. Similarly, the meat company JBS has a "net-zero" plan that ignores its methane emissions while continuing to fuel the destruction of the Amazon.

A video series has been created to expose this deception. Instead of offsets, we are advocating for "real zero." This is achieved through actual emission cuts, not accounting tricks. The solution requires phasing out fossil fuels and industrial meat, protecting rights, and shifting to renewable energy and plant-rich diets. This must be done without offsets.
