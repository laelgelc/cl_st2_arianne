Amid the COVID-19 crisis and its resulting economic shocks, we must prevent public funds from supporting planet-destroying industries. Instead, this money must be directed toward a just transition that benefits human well-being and planetary health. We must hold our leaders accountable and be vigilant against the exploitation of workers through any "shock doctrine." This is a time to advocate for a cooperative, egalitarian future that exists in harmony with nature.

To combat the virus, solidarity is essential. We must reject blame and division, and instead work to build alliances. The pandemic is an opportunity to learn lessons, address systemic issues, and protect vulnerable people. This requires compassion, courage, and cooperation.

Greenpeace members are sharing their own personal challenges and inspiring others with acts of solidarity. While we remain vigilant during this crisis, it is also important to practice self-care.
