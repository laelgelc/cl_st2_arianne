Throwaway plastic is destroying the world. It harms our health, accelerates social injustice, destroys biodiversity, and fuels the climate crisis. The solution requires a human rights-based approach that prioritizes the health, environment, and justice for affected communities.

Greenpeace demands a strong Global Plastics Treaty to secure a safer future. This treaty must keep oil and gas in the ground, end the relentless production of plastic, and phase out single-use plastics.

We must be aware of efforts from industry and governments to weaken the treaty. That is why we are building a global movement to fight for an ambitious agreement by 2024. This agreement must cap plastic production, phase out virgin plastics, and ensure a just transition to a zero-waste economy.
