Dutch authorities have discovered eggs contaminated with the banned pesticide fipronil, sparking a food safety scandal that has led to arrests in both the Netherlands and Belgium. Millions of eggs may be affected, prompting the closure of farms and causing retailers such as Lidl and Aldi to remove products from their shelves. In Germany, authorities are now testing egg-based items.

This incident is connected to the ongoing crises within industrialized farming, which has previously seen outbreaks of E. coli and bird flu. The root of the problem is a profit-driven system with poor oversight that puts public health at risk. This system also harms animals and contributes to deforestation, pollution, and climate issues.

To fix our broken food system, we need systemic change and greater transparency. Individuals can also take action by eating fewer animal products and choosing food from ecological sources.
