In November, several positive environmental developments were recorded. In a step forward for reducing fossil fuel dependence, Greece ran entirely on renewable energy for a period of five hours on October 5.

Progress was also made in transitioning away from fossil fuel-powered transportation. New York advanced a plan to ban the sale of new gasoline-powered vehicles by 2035. This move mandates that zero-emission vehicle sales must increase over time, starting with a target of 35% in 2026.

In the Arctic, the energy company Equinor has postponed the development of the Wisting oil field. This decision will likely prevent the project from moving forward, which in turn averts the associated CO2 emissions.

Meanwhile, a citizen-led legal action achieved a significant victory for air quality. Residents in Jakarta won their second appeal in an air pollution lawsuit, which now obligates the government to set official air quality standards and create strategies to tackle the problem.

Finally, opposition to deep sea mining was strengthened when French President Emmanuel Macron endorsed a ban on the practice during the COP27 climate conference.
