Four years after Angela Merkel committed Germany to a 40% greenhouse gas emissions cut by 2020 at the Paris Climate Agreement, the government is being sued for climate inaction. Three organic farming families—the Blohms, the Lütke Schwienhorsts, and the Backsens—are taking the government to court in the first federal court defense of its kind.

Germany has abandoned its climate targets as rising temperatures impact agriculture globally. The effects are being felt directly by the families involved in the lawsuit. The Blohms are facing reduced apple yields and invasions from pests, which has forced them to remove their cherry trees. The Lütke Schwienhorsts are enduring prolonged droughts that threaten their business. On their island farm, the Backsens are confronting rising sea levels that endanger their future. Supporters are urged to join the calls for accountability.
