At the Copenhagen Fashion Summit, major brands including H&M, Zara, and Burberry gathered to discuss sustainability. A key focus was circularity within a fashion industry that generates €1.5 trillion in revenue and produces over a billion garments annually. This industry is projected to grow its production by 63% by 2030.

The environmental impact of this model is massive, involving 80 billion cubic meters of water use, more than a million tonnes of CO2 emissions, and 92 million tonnes of waste. While circularity is part of the conversation, it is an insufficient solution without a reduction in overall production volumes. Unlimited growth is simply not possible on a finite planet.

Instead of relying on consumer recycling or other placebo solutions, brands must fundamentally shift away from the fast fashion model. They need to promote durable, repairable clothes and encourage the principle of buying less.
