While there was hope for renewed normalcy in a post-pandemic 2021, challenges have persisted as part of a "new normal." Climate change-linked threats are prominent among these challenges. In Kenya, desert locust invasions are risking food security and have raised concerns over the use of harmful pesticides.

The year began with extreme weather events across the globe. Beijing experienced sandstorms, while Australia faced floods following its bushfires. Forest fires broke out in Nepal, and deadly flash floods occurred in Angola. Spain saw a record snowstorm, and Indonesia suffered from floods linked to land clearing. South Korea recorded its coldest day in decades. Cyclone Eloise brought devastation to Mozambique and neighboring countries. In Texas, a polar vortex led to blackouts, and in the Amazon, floods impacted Indigenous communities.

Collective government action on the climate crisis is necessary to ensure safety and equity for all.
