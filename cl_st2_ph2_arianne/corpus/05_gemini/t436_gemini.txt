On Philippine Independence Day, Metro Manila is emerging from an 89-day COVID-19 quarantine, the longest in the world. This lockdown is set to end on June 15 without having flattened the curve or implemented mass testing. In this context, the Anti-Terrorism Bill poses a new threat, threatening to criminalize opposition through a dangerously broad definition of terrorism.

The proposed legislation would empower the executive branch to tag activists as terrorists, enabling warrantless arrests and detentions for up to 24 days. It also allows for surveillance lasting as long as 90 days. These provisions violate the Constitution and international law, and they neglect the vulnerabilities of specific groups, including Muslims and Lumads.

At a time when activism is crucial to address the interconnected crises of poverty, the pandemic, and climate change, this bill works to stifle it. The government is prioritizing suppression over addressing these real threats. Instead of focusing on genuine recovery, it is pushing for a business-as-usual approach that includes destructive industries like mining and corporate bailouts.
