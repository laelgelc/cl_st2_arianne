My name is Khalia and I am a Press Officer with Greenpeace Russia. I am committed to protecting the environment. I love the Great Northern Forest for its wild beauty, its role in fighting climate change, and because it is a home for species like bears and endangered reindeer.

As a consumer, I have doubts about the everyday products I buy and their potential links to the destruction of this forest. Investigations have shown that Russian companies, including Pomor Timber, Arkhangelsk Pulp and Paper Mill, and Titan Group, are logging in the unprotected Dvinsky Forest. At the current rate, this forest could be lost within a decade.

These logging companies supply major brands, including Nestlé, PepsiCo, and McDonald’s. Greenpeace is urging these companies to stop their unsustainable practices. We are also calling for people to sign a petition to save the Dvinsky Forest.
