Greenpeace cofounder Dorothy Metcalfe passed away on December 10. A seasoned journalist, she was a dedicated peace activist who helped launch Greenpeace using innovative tactics like billboards and boat protests.

During the 1971-1972 campaigns against U.S. and French nuclear tests at Amchitka and Moruroa, she managed radio communications and media outreach. Her work included pressuring leaders like Pierre Trudeau and arranging an audience with Pope Paul VI. Alongside her husband Ben, she skillfully turned a deportation from France into a publicity coup.

Born in Winnipeg in 1931, a Celebration of Life for Dorothy is scheduled for February 18 in West Vancouver.
