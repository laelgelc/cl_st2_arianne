Commercial whaling historically decimated whale populations, much like the overfishing that has depleted the oceans of large fish. While some whale populations have shown signs of recovery, this is not a reason to resume a practice that belongs in the past. Whales are vital for the health of our oceans and, as long-lived species, they are particularly vulnerable.

There are compelling reasons why hunting these magnificent creatures should be avoided. We still don't know what their historical population levels were, or what a full recovery would truly look like. We are, in fact, still discovering new species of whales, highlighting how much remains unknown. These are not simple creatures; they exhibit complex cultural behaviors that we are only beginning to understand.

Their role in the ecosystem is critical. Whales are essential for distributing nutrients throughout the ocean and even play a part in mitigating climate change. At the same time, they are already under immense pressure. Their bodies accumulate toxins from polluted waters, and they face numerous indirect, human-caused threats, including death from ship strikes and entanglement in fishing gear. Adding commercial hunting to this list is unjustifiable.

Managing a potential hunt would be fraught with problems. Whales migrate across international borders, making them a shared global responsibility. Furthermore, we do not yet fully grasp how the impacts of climate change will affect their populations. History has shown us that attempts to exploit whale populations inevitably lead to over-exploitation. Most importantly, there is simply no significant economic need or widespread demand for whale meat in the modern world.

Given the multitude of ongoing threats and their profound importance to marine ecosystems, our focus must be on conservation. It is time to consign commercial whaling to the history books for good.
