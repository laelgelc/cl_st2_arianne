To build hope and momentum for 2022, we can celebrate 10 inspiring environmental wins from 2021.

Around the world, there were significant victories for the planet. In Gambia, a destructive fishmeal plant was halted. New Zealand took a stand for its oceans by rejecting seabed mining. China made a pledge to stop building new coal projects overseas, while in Russia, a historic fine was issued to Norilsk Nickel for an oil spill in the Arctic.

Governments and corporations were held accountable. Mexico moved to protect its food systems by banning GM corn and beginning a phase-out of glyphosate. The fossil fuel industry faced major challenges: Shell withdrew from the UK's Cambo oil field, and the Keystone XL pipeline was cancelled. In a landmark legal case, a Dutch court ordered Shell to cut its emissions by 45% by 2030.

Courts also compelled governments to act. Indonesia saw a ruling that requires the state to address Jakarta's air pollution. In France, a court found the state had been negligent on climate action, a significant finding for government accountability.
