Jim Bohlen, one of the true founders of Greenpeace, passed away on July 5, 2010, at the age of 84.

Born in New York City in 1926, Bohlen served as a radio operator in the US Navy and earned an engineering degree. He was a Quaker who opposed the Vietnam War, a conviction that led him to move to Vancouver in the late 1960s. In 1968, he met Irving and Dorothy Stowe at an anti-war protest and joined the Sierra Club.

A year later, in 1969, they formed the Don’t Make a Wave Committee to oppose US nuclear tests planned for Amchitka. The idea for their first major protest came from Bohlen's wife, Marie, who suggested sailing a boat into the test zone. Following her inspiration, Bohlen announced plans to do just that, sparking a fundraising effort that led to the voyage of the Phyllis Cormack. This protest, renamed Greenpeace, successfully delayed the nuclear tests and ultimately led to their cancellation.

Bohlen continued his anti-nuclear activism into the 1980s. He retired in 1987 and later advocated for renewable energy as a Green Party candidate. He is survived by his family and by Greenpeace.
