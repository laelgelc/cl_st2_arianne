World Meat Free Day provides an opportunity to reflect on how our eating habits affect our personal health and the planet. Animal agriculture contributes to water pollution, deforestation, and climate change. However, our daily food choices can be a powerful force in reforming the system.

To help inspire change, we are featuring plant-based recipes from Greenpeace ship chef Daniel Bravo Garibi. A Greenpeace volunteer since 2003, Chef Daniel is an advocate for sustainable food procurement and reduced meat consumption.

He has shared his recipes for lentil ceviche and purslane salad with citrus vinaigrette. Links are available for the written recipes, instructional videos, and Spanish versions.

We invite you to try these recipes, share your own, and make a pledge for change.
