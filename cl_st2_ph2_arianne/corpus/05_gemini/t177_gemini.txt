The vast variety of life on Earth, our planet's biodiversity, is essential for our interconnected survival. It provides crucial benefits, including our health, our food security, and our ability to adapt to a changing climate.

We are currently in a human-driven biodiversity crisis. This crisis threatens one million species with extinction. Today, only 15% of the world's forests remain intact, and a mere 3% of our oceans are pristine. This loss of biodiversity worsens climate change and makes the emergence of zoonotic diseases, such as COVID-19, more likely.

In the fall of 2022, in Kunming, China, governments have a critical opportunity at the CBD COP15 summit. They can adopt a new global framework to halt mass extinction. Greenpeace is advocating for ambitious outcomes from this summit. This framework must include a commitment to protecting 30% of lands and oceans by 2030. It must also ensure the rights of Indigenous Peoples are respected, and it needs to be backed by secure finance and clear implementation plans.
