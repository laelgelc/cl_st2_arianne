In 2016, artist Benjamin Von Wong created an art project depicting a mermaid ensnared in 10,000 plastic bottles. The installation garnered 35 million views, sparking discussions on disposable culture. It also drove policy talks, behavior shifts, and awareness of single-use plastics.

Despite this progress, plastic production persists. For the Global Plastics Treaty, Von Wong built a 4-story faucet installation at the UN, but its message was misconstrued.

Now, partnering with Greenpeace, he has created a 5-meter perpetual plastic machine. The artwork illustrates the fossil fuel-plastic lifecycle. The project's purpose is to urge a strong treaty with a moratorium on virgin plastic production ahead of the INC-2 negotiations.
