In 2016, artist Benjamin Von Wong created an image of a mermaid ensnared in 10,000 plastic bottles. The project garnered 35 million views, sparked discussions on disposable culture, and successfully drove policy changes and reduced single-use plastic consumption.

Despite this progress, plastic production persists. Last year, Von Wong built a 4-story faucet installation at the United Nations for the Global Plastics Treaty, but its message was misconstrued.

Now, partnering with Greenpeace, he has created a 5-meter perpetual plastic machine. This installation illustrates the lifecycle between fossil fuels and plastic. Together, we are urging for a strong Global Plastics Treaty that includes a moratorium on virgin plastic production, ahead of the INC-2 negotiations.
