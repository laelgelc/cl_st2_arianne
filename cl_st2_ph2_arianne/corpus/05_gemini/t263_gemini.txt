Cities dominated by cars are harming our climate and the quality of urban life. Greenpeace has noted this, criticising manufacturers like Volkswagen for their role. The daily reality of these mobility challenges is highlighted in the stories of six women.

Mothers face unsafe sidewalks and a lack of open spaces for their children. Disabled individuals encounter obstacles like inaccessible parking. For those who rely on public transport or biking, the experience involves long waits, safety risks, and navigating poor infrastructure.

To address these issues, we need ambitious policies. We must advocate for better public transport, more green spaces, and universal accessibility. Such changes will improve life for all, particularly for vulnerable groups.

During European Mobility Week 2021, the #MobilityForAll campaign is pushing for these radical city transformations.
