COVID-19 is a zoonotic disease, similar to SARS and avian flu. The pandemic highlights vulnerabilities that stem from industrial animal farming, where cramped conditions serve to increase disease risks.

Environmental degradation, which includes deforestation and pollution, disrupts the ecosystems that naturally provide a shield against pandemics. Intact forests and oceans, on the other hand, provide us with clean air, climate protection, and medical insights.

For recovery, we must avoid bailouts for destructive industries. Support should instead be directed toward green jobs and sustainable food systems. A ban on the wildlife trade is necessary. Ultimately, we must prioritize human and planetary health through collective action.
