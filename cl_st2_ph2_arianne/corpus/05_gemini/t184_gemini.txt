Ukrainian scientist Svitlana Krakovska has stated that human-induced climate change and the war in Ukraine are linked by a common cause: fossil fuel dependency. Fossil fuel companies are profiting from conflicts and crises, which is why governments must immediately begin to phase out fossil fuels to secure both peace and a stable climate.

With fossil fuels comprising over 80% of the world's energy, this dependency fuels geopolitical imbalances and wars, including Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The solution is to reduce energy demand through improved efficiency and to transition to renewable energy sources. Renewables are faster to install, cheaper, and less susceptible to the power struggles that characterize the fossil fuel economy.

We must divest from Russian fossil fuels and implement an embargo against them, while also providing humanitarian aid. There is a history of oil-related conflicts, and companies are once again exploiting a crisis for profit.
