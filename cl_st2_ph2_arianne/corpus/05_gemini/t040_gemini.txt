The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) 6th Assessment Report has updated the "Burning Embers" diagram, revealing that climate-related risks escalate to high and very high levels at lower global warming thresholds than previously assessed in the AR5 and SR15 reports.

This update is based on new evidence concerning ice-sheet instability, the slowdown of ocean circulation, and changes in the carbon cycle. The findings indicate that even a global warming level of 1.5°C poses high risks from extreme weather events and to various systems. For example, unique ecosystems like coral reefs are already transitioning into a high-risk state at the current warming of 1.1°C.

The evolution of the "Burning Embers" diagram since its introduction in 2001 reflects that risks are intensifying earlier than previously understood. These updated findings underscore the urgency for governments and industries to take action to adhere to the 1.5°C warming limit.
