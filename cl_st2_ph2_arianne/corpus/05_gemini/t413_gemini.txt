Through long-term projects, four photographers are documenting the realities of climate change. Swastik Pal captures the experiences of islanders in the Sundarbans who are facing rising seas, increased salinity, floods, and displacement, with a focus on highlighting their resilience.

In the Fertile Crescent, Nadia Bseiso explores the region's water scarcity and droughts. Her work questions the area's ongoing fertility and advocates for greater awareness of the environmental challenges.

Amilton Neves examines the impacts of deforestation from the timber industry and the effects of cyclones in Mozambique. Through his photography, he aims to promote the preservation of the local environment.

In Indonesia, Agoes Rudianto documents Jakarta's sinking land and frequent floods. His project also records the adaptations being made, such as the construction of sea walls.

Together, their work fosters deeper environmental narratives that emphasize the need for both awareness and action.
