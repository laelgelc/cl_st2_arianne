In May and June of 2015, Greenpeace teams conducted expeditions to remote mountain areas on three different continents. We collected snow and water samples, and in every single location, we found persistent and hazardous per- and poly-fluorinated chemicals, also known as PFCs.

These chemicals are used in industrial processes and for waterproofing outdoor gear. The problem is that PFCs degrade extremely slowly, allowing them to spread globally. They are known to harm reproduction, promote the growth of tumors, and affect the hormone system.

Ironically, the very outdoor industry that relies on images of pristine nature is releasing these chemicals into the environment.

The good news is that safer, PFC-free alternatives exist. During our expeditions, these alternatives performed well. For this reason, Greenpeace is urging outdoor brands to eliminate these hazardous chemicals. We are also calling on consumers to join our Detox campaign and demand an end to the use of PFCs.
