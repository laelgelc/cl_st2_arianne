To resist the powerful institutions that are destroying our planet, we need equal acts of courage. This courage is not only found in protests, but also in the simple acts of questioning consumerism and rejecting our own feelings of powerlessness.

We have a history of achieving change. Together, we have exposed trade deals, protected ecosystems, and established marine sanctuaries. We have held institutions legally accountable, pushed to phase out single-use plastics, and worked towards ending the age of fossil fuels.

Now, our focus must be on "tomorrow." We must break the cycle of overconsumption and hold corporations accountable. We need to reduce the impacts of industrial livestock, promote equality, and shake the very foundations of inequitable power structures.

Even when the news is disheartening, we must rise. We can do this through a contagious courage, by embracing renewables and sustainable agriculture. We must empower the leaders who will help us rebuild a positive future.
