Working on the Arctic campaign, we often talk about the incredible reindeer, also known as caribou (Rangifer tarandus). Their antlers are one of their most well-known features, but what’s fascinating is that they grow them annually. Each set is unique, like a fingerprint, and is covered in a warm velvet while it grows. While males shed their antlers in December, the females retain theirs. These shed antlers don't go to waste; they provide essential minerals for other animals in the ecosystem.

Their adaptations for survival are truly remarkable. Reindeer milk is exceptionally rich, containing 22% butterfat and 10% protein. Even their eyes adapt to the seasons, changing color from gold to blue. To survive the cold, they are equipped with hollow hair that acts as insulation and a specialized nose that warms the air they breathe. Their footpads also change with the seasons.

Beyond these physical traits, they are speedy and energy-efficient runners. They make distinctive sounds as they move, as their knees are known to click. They also possess air sacs that allow them to make unique vocalizations.
