Roland Hipp, the Managing Director of Greenpeace Germany, celebrates the end of nuclear power in Germany, calling it a people-powered victory. This achievement is the result of decades of protests against reprocessing plants, the transport of nuclear waste, and the construction of new facilities.

Among the key successes were the stopping of the Wackersdorf plant in 1989 and the rejection of the unsuitable Gorleben repository. In 2005, a ban was secured on waste shipments to Sellafield and La Hague after Greenpeace exposed high radiation levels.

He highlights the inherent risks of nuclear power, citing the disasters at Chernobyl and Fukushima. Furthermore, he points to the dependency on Russia for uranium and the global problem that there is still no safe repository for nuclear waste anywhere in the world. For a secure future, he urges a shift to renewables.
