On July 25, 2020, the Wakashio bulk carrier, which was operated by Mitsui OSK Lines (MOL) and fueled by BP, ran aground near Mauritius. The incident resulted in a leak of nearly 1,000 tonnes of toxic oil into a pristine lagoon, causing devastation to fisheries, tourism, and ecosystems.

The disaster led to the deaths of over 50 whales and dolphins and three tugboat crew members. In response, locals were prompted to combat the spill with improvised means. The Mauritian government sank part of the ship in a whale nursing ground. Furthermore, the government withheld information on the type of oil, the ecological damage, and compensation, and it shielded the corporations involved.

This event is a criticism of the unregulated shipping and fossil fuel industries for their ongoing emissions and disasters. It underscores the need to support youth activism and implement stricter regulations, such as designating sensitive sea areas.
