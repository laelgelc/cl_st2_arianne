Toru Anzai, a former resident of the Fukushima village of Iitate, misses gathering bamboo shoots, a simple act made impossible since the 2011 nuclear disaster forced the village's abandonment. Iitate's population has fallen from 6,300 to approximately 900, a community now composed mostly of elderly returnees.

These residents face ongoing radiation exposure that exceeds safety standards, a fact confirmed by Greenpeace research. The region's forested areas make decontamination impossible. Mr. Anzai has personally suffered from a range of health issues, including skin pain, hair loss, headaches, strokes, and heart attacks, which he attributes to the "black snow" fallout after the disaster.

In this context, the government is pressuring people to return and has ended housing subsidies. It also plans to release over a million tonnes of radioactive water into the ocean, a move that will worsen pollution. For Toru Anzai, the situation has left him feeling abandoned and angry.
