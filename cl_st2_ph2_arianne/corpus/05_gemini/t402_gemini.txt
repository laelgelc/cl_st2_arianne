Greenpeace is heading to the Arctic to document and witness the yearly sea ice minimum. This is when the ice reaches its smallest extent at the end of the summer, and this year it could potentially be one of the lowest recorded.

The trip aims to highlight the impacts that climate breakdown is having on our oceans and wildlife. As the ice melts, it enables new shipping routes and industrial activities, which exacerbates the threats our oceans face. A study has predicted that the Arctic could be free of summer ice by 2035.

We are urging people to support a Global Ocean Treaty to protect 30% of our oceans by 2030. You can help by supporting our petition. We also invite you to follow our journey on Instagram.
