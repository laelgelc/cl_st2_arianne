Coal has been the world’s primary source of energy since 2003. It is the largest emitter of CO2, and the mining process also releases methane.

Despite efforts by politicians like Trump to support fossil fuels, a global shift away from coal is happening. New research from Greenpeace and CoalSwarm shows that 23 countries, states, and cities are planning to phase out coal by 2030. This includes three G7 economies, and Italy may also be joining this group.

This commitment equates to 370 coal plants being shut down or avoided. The scale of this change is significant, representing enough power for six United Kingdoms and the retirement of half a trillion USD in assets.

This transition is being demanded by people through worldwide protests. From actions at Kingsnorth in the UK to clean air activists in Delhi, there is a clear call for a move to renewables.
