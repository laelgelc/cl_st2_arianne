The fight against the climate crisis is deeply connected to the pursuit of global equality. Across the globe, women are powerfully engaged in advancing climate and environmental protection.

On International Women’s Day and beyond, we are celebrating women from Greenpeace worldwide. They are sharing insights into their daily work and the changes they wish to see. Our use of the term 'women' is inclusive, encompassing trans, non-binary, and cisgender individuals.

Among those featured are Elena Keil, a Project Assistant; Anabela Angelovska, a content producer and filmmaker; and Karla Stretz, an online-editor, all from Greenpeace Germany's “50 Years Greenpeace International” team.

We invite you to watch 50 video messages from these inspiring individuals and to share with us who inspires you.
