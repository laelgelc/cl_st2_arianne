To protect yourself from air pollution, you can exercise outdoors during the early morning or in the evening, when the air is often clearer. The route you take matters; using side streets can reduce your exposure by as much as 60%. Visiting local parks is another way to find cleaner air, and it offers mental health benefits as well.

When you are on busy roads, walking further from the curb can help. It is also advisable to wait a few steps back at traffic lights to avoid concentrated emissions. This is particularly important for children. At home, you can open windows that face away from busy roads.

In the long term, switching to clean transport like electric vehicles is essential. Greenpeace campaigns for this change and urges government action to lower pollution.
