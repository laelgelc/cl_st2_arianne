Following the annual global leadership meeting, Executive Directors Jennifer Morgan and Bunny McDiarmid discussed the event's focus on #TimesUp: Justice, Safety, and Diversity. Building on reflections from #MeToo, there was unanimous agreement to create dedicated reporting spaces for victims of sexual harassment. A complaints team will also be established.

The leadership committed to investing in trainings covering harassment prevention, unconscious bias, and diversity. An aim has been set to achieve 50% women in senior leadership roles. Furthermore, there is a plan to improve global integrity systems by October 2018.

The organization will strengthen its anti-harassment policies, with a zero-tolerance stance on bullying, discrimination, or harassment. This commitment ensures that thorough investigations will be conducted and actions will be taken. Ultimately, the directors have committed to addressing equity and creating safe spaces.
