Following the Galaxy Note7 fiasco, Samsung is at a crossroads, with an opportunity for a fresh start that could benefit both consumers and the planet. Greenpeace has highlighted the potential environmental disaster posed by the 4.3 million faulty phones, which contain tonnes of valuable resources like cobalt, gold, silver, and tungsten that would be wasted if not reused.

In response to public and governmental pressure, Samsung has acknowledged these concerns and is reviewing its options to minimize the environmental impact. This is a chance for Samsung to become a true leader by creating durable, easily repairable devices built from recycled materials. Such a move would align with the circular economy principles the company promotes on its own website.

We demand that Samsung be transparent about its plans for the millions of recalled phones. We urge the company to seize this moment to fundamentally rethink its approach to product design, production, and reuse to ensure valuable resources are not simply destroyed.
