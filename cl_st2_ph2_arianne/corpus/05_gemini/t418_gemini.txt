For migrant fishers from Southeast Asia, hopes for a better life can turn into harsh conditions on industrial fishing vessels. This exploitation is akin to modern slavery, involving long hours, abuse, and sometimes death.

To highlight this, Greenpeace has produced two films based on true stories uncovered by Greenpeace East Asia and Southeast Asia. Filmed in Taiwan, the films feature real Indonesian workers and depict the grim experiences and unfair treatment fishers endure. They also show the personal motivations, such as family, that drive them. Over 30 fishers were interviewed for these stories, but they fear losing their jobs if they complain.

Consumers can help address this exploitation by choosing sustainable seafood and raising awareness about the issue.
