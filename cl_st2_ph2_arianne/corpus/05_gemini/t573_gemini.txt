Deep sea mining companies are promoting a number of myths to justify their destructive industry. One of the most common is that it represents a "green" solution, necessary for the transition to clean energy technologies like renewables and electric vehicles. In reality, deep sea mining could actually make climate change worse. The process threatens to release carbon that is currently stored in seabed sediments, which would undermine efforts to tackle the climate crisis.

Another misleading claim is that mining the seabed helps avoid the human rights abuses associated with mining on land. This argument ignores the new threats this industry creates, as it poses significant risks to the ocean-dependent communities and the marine environments they rely on for their livelihoods and culture.

Finally, proponents argue that minerals from the deep sea are essential for technology, including smartphones. However, this assertion is unsubstantiated by the information technology sector itself.

Instead of opening a new frontier of extraction and destruction, the path forward is to embrace a circular economy. We must prioritise improved recycling and an overall reduction in the use of metals. Tech giants have a critical role to play by showing leadership in this shift and helping to protect our oceans for future generations.
