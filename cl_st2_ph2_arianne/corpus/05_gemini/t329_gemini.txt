In the Indian Ocean, the Saya de Malha Bank is a vibrant home to wildlife including pygmy blue whales, sperm whales, flying fish, and tuna. Part of the Mascarene Plateau connecting Seychelles, Mauritius, and Réunion, this area features the world's largest seagrass meadow. This meadow is a major carbon sink that stores carbon, helping to slow climate breakdown, and provides a habitat that supports species such as dugongs and tiger sharks.

The Saya de Malha Bank is recognized as an Ecologically and Biologically Significant Area. It is under shared governance between Seychelles and Mauritius, with some parts located in international waters. Onboard the Arctic Sunrise, a Greenpeace expedition has been mapping the region's wildlife using binoculars, hydrophones, and eDNA collected from water samples.

The ocean, however, is facing significant pressures. This includes a 71% decline in shark populations resulting from bycatch. In response to these threats, Greenpeace is calling for the creation of ocean sanctuaries and the implementation of a Global Ocean Treaty.
