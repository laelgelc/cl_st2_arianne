A massive die-off of benthic marine organisms has occurred on the Kamchatka peninsula in Russia. The seawater changed color and gave off an unpleasant smell, while locals, including surfers, experienced health issues like sore throats and nausea. Dead animals have washed ashore, with reports indicating that 95% of seabed life has been killed near a UNESCO site.

Greenpeace Russia has responded by taking samples, using drones for investigation, and consulting with experts. We are demanding an independent probe into the cause of this disaster, which remains unknown. The cause could be natural, such as toxic algae, or human-related, like the dumping of waste.

This event highlights Russia's environmental problems. Referencing the Norilsk oil spill, we urge a green economic transformation. It is imperative to advocate for renewable energy and for policies that protect both people and nature.
