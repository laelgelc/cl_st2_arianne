After two years of a global campaign involving nearly 700,000 people, Thai Union, the world's largest tuna company, has committed to a series of reforms. The company, which owns brands such as John West and Chicken of the Sea, will take significant steps to transform its operations.

The commitments include reducing the use of destructive Fish Aggregating Devices (FADs) by an average of 50% by 2020. In that same timeframe, the company will double the amount of FAD-free fish available in its supply chain. Thai Union will also shift to more sustainable methods like pole-and-line or troll-caught tuna.

To address human rights and labor abuse, the company will extend its moratorium on at-sea transshipment. It will also ensure human observers are present on all longline vessels to help prevent labor abuse and develop a comprehensive code of conduct. An independent audit is planned for next year to verify these changes.

Other companies must now follow this lead. We will continue to work for sustainable fisheries and hold companies accountable to ensure the protection of our oceans and the workers who depend on them.
