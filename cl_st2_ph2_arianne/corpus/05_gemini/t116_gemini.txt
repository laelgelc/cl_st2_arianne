As part of Greenpeace's tech vision to support mobilization, we have introduced GreenAct, an app for Android and iOS designed to enhance environmental activism. This ads-free, community-owned application provides users with instant notifications and access to Greenpeace volunteer communities.

After logging in, users can participate in activities, groups, and campaigns with Greenpeace or other organizations. Created with Open Social, GreenAct acts as a gateway to independently managed communities. Each of these communities handles user data under their own specific privacy policies.

The app is currently available in select countries, such as Austria, Belgium, and Brazil. We have plans to expand GreenAct to serve as a mobile hub for environmental activism.
