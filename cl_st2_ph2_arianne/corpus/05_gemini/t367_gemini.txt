To combat the climate crisis, Greenpeace Korea has been campaigning for Hyundai Motor Company (HMC) to shift from selling internal combustion engine (ICE) cars to 100% electric vehicles (EVs).

In response, HMC has announced plans to increase its proportion of EVs and fuel cell electric vehicles to 25.8% of its sales by 2030, and 78% by 2040. The company is aiming for 100% EV sales in major markets like Europe, China, and the United States by 2040, but this plan does not extend globally.

This is insufficient. To achieve net-zero by 2050, a full transition to EVs must happen by 2035. A more rapid shift to electric vehicles offers numerous benefits, including lower costs, improved air quality, and the creation of new jobs. Other regions are already moving faster, with places like Norway, the UK, and California implementing quicker bans on the sale of new ICE vehicles.
