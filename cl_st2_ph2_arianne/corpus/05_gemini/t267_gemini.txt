During Mobility Week, the #MobilityForAll campaign featured actions across Europe demanding equitable urban mobility. In Italy, activists transformed parking lots for Park(ing) Day, while in Romania, a Critical Mass Bike Ride pushed for 100 km of new bike lanes in Bucharest.

Protests took place in Belgium against cuts to public transport. On Car-Free Day in Hungary, reverse graffiti was used to expose the number of deaths caused by air pollution. In Spain, mobilizations were held to protest against airport expansions. These events followed pre-week actions, including protests in Germany at the IAA motor show against climate-damaging cars and a model train display in Spain.

The week served to promote sustainable transport as a way to cut CO2 emissions. The campaign's demands include the creation of car-free zones, improved and accessible public transport, shared mobility options, better cycling infrastructure, and more green spaces.
