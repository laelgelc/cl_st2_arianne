Katie Camosy, Senior Video Producer at Greenpeace USA, was part of the Greenpeace ship Esperanza's Pole to Pole expedition. She travelled to the Sargasso Sea in the North Atlantic with the goal of highlighting why it requires protection under the Global Oceans Treaty.

In her role as Visuals Lead, she enlisted underwater photographers Tavish Campbell and Shane Gross to document the ecosystem's biodiversity. From the surface, the sea can appear sparse, with only occasional seabirds or flying fish visible, necessitating deeper exploration to see more.

The team used blackwater photography, which involved the divers descending 30 meters at night over ocean depths of 4,000 meters. On these dives, they encountered larval and adult creatures that were migrating from the mesopelagic zone.
