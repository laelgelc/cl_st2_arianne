Amid global crises, invisible revolutions are challenging the current socioeconomic system. In Brazil's semi-arid region, home to the endangered Caatinga biome, one such movement is taking shape. A network known as ASA, comprising over 3,000 organizations, is working to promote dignified lives through adaptation to water scarcity.

This effort has led to the implementation of over one million rainwater cisterns. Community-led projects are also underway, including the "re-Caatinga-ing" of degraded areas to make them suitable for agriculture. The work prioritizes food security, the use of native seeds, and strong civic participation.

Women and youth are significant beneficiaries of these initiatives. The entire approach emphasizes collective action and environmental care, fundamentally redefining the concept of an economy. It is framed as the stewardship of our common home, working toward a just future for all.
