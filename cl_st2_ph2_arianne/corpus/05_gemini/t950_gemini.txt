Joni Mitchell was instrumental in launching Greenpeace by headlining a 1970 benefit concert in Vancouver, which raised $17,000 for anti-nuclear efforts. Her advocacy for the natural world continued as she later supported whale campaigns.

Born in Alberta in 1943, Mitchell overcame polio and rose to fame as a singer-songwriter with albums such as *Song to a Seagull* (1968) and *Clouds* (1969). She developed unique guitar tunings, and her music later evolved toward jazz fusions, including collaborations with artists like Charles Mingus.

On March 31, 2015, Joni Mitchell suffered a brain aneurysm. She is currently recovering at home in Los Angeles with daily therapies.
