Following nearly 100 reported cases of explosions, Samsung is recalling 4.3 million Galaxy Note 7 phones. This global collection effort involves 730,000 kilograms of technology, with 1.8 million of these devices having already been sold in 10 countries.

Samsung has stated it plans to dispose of these phones, confirming they will not be repaired, refurbished, or resold. In response, Greenpeace is urging the company to be transparent and publish its disposal plans. To prevent significant waste and environmental harm, it is critical that these millions of devices are not dumped or burned.

Instead, the phones should be dismantled to allow for the safe recovery of precious materials. Resources such as gold, cobalt, and tungsten can be recovered for reuse. This crisis presents an opportunity for Samsung to become a leader in innovative electronics design and recycling.
