In 2017, Dina Kafafi founded the Sinaweya project, a social enterprise in Egypt's Sinai region dedicated to preserving the ecological and cultural heritage of St. Catherine. As a UNESCO site, St. Catherine faces threats from tourism development and climate change.

The project collaborates with the Bedouin Jabaliya tribe, placing value on their ancestral knowledge in horticulture, herbalism, and crafts. Through this partnership, Sinaweya works to empower local communities by rehabilitating gardens, creating a herbal database, and establishing the be.do brand.

These efforts foster economic opportunities, self-sufficiency, and environmental care. They enable locals, such as women embroiderers and young gardeners, to sustain their livelihoods and revive traditional practices.
