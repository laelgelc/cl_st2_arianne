There is an African concept known as "Ubuntu," which speaks to a universal bond connecting all of humanity for our collective salvation.

This idea is central to the Greenpeace Alternative Futures Project. As part of this initiative, young artists from countries like Zambia, South Africa, Chile, Kenya, Indonesia, Panama, and Australia used AI to visualize green and fair futures in the midst of global inequality.

The artists shared their visions of diversity, community, and potential. Their personal inspirations were reflected in quotes, which also touched upon the role of AI in democratizing creativity.

Ultimately, the project encourages us all to dare to dream together for a better world that respects people and the earth.
