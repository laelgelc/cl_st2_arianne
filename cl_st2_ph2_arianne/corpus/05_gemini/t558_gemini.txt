Our Pole to Pole voyage documented the oceans' wonders and the threats they face from climate change, overfishing, plastic pollution, and the emerging danger of deep-sea mining. This journey was undertaken to advocate for a UN Global Ocean Treaty, a crucial step toward creating sanctuaries for marine life.

During our expeditions, we visited the Antarctic, where we revealed that penguin populations are in decline due to a scarcity of krill. In the waters of the Amazon Reef, we confirmed its importance as a whale breeding ground. We journeyed to the Sargasso Sea, highlighting the plight of wildlife found trapped in plastic. We also explored the Lost City hydrothermal vents, a unique ecosystem now facing risks from deep-sea mining.

Our work extended beyond observation. We produced the film "Turtle Journey" to raise awareness, confronted fishing vessels, and conducted research on turtles and sharks. Amid disappointing UN negotiations, we have continued to urge for decisive global action to protect our shared oceans.
