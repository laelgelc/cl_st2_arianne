Following Vale's dam collapse, the Paraopeba River has been contaminated by toxic mud and a range of heavy metals, including nickel, mercury, lead, zinc, and cadmium. This contamination has resulted in a 40 km stretch of the river being declared dead, a consequence of high turbidity and a lack of oxygen in the water.

The impact on local communities has been significant. Residents like the couple Jair and Conceição, who previously relied on the river, have been forced to abandon fishing there. They now fish in an artificial dam instead. Other residents have expressed a deep sadness over the environmental devastation, mourning the loss of fish species and the river's natural beauty.

The situation has also created a public emergency for the city of Pará de Minas, which depends on the Paraopeba River as its water source. The contamination and its effects have profoundly altered the routines and lives of the entire community.
