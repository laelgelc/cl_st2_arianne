Air pollution stands as a major global health risk. In 2021, the World Health Organization (WHO) responded by tightening its air quality guidelines for PM 2.5 to an annual average of 5 µg/m3.

Across the globe, Greenpeace campaigns are mobilizing for cleaner air. In Malaysia, advocacy against haze has led to a human rights complaint, a roundtable discussion, and viral art interventions. In Turkey, a country with high fossil fuel reliance and 30,000 annual deaths linked to air pollution, collaborative efforts with other NGOs have successfully shut down coal plants. The campaign continues to push for the government to align its standards with WHO guidelines.

In Indonesia, a citizen lawsuit was filed against Jakarta officials for their inaction on air quality. This resulted in a 2021 court verdict ordering the officials to improve the city's air. Following the verdict, the officials filed appeals. Meanwhile, in Thailand, public pressure through petitions and a lawsuit prompted the government to act. In 2023, the country's daily PM 2.5 standard was revised to 37.5 µg/m3.

These actions highlight the power of citizen unity in the fight for clean air.
