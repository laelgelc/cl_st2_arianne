In Poland, delegates are gathering for the COP24 UN climate conference to work on the Paris Agreement's rulebook. This process is like editing a global Google document, and it is crucial for the future of our climate, oceans, forests, and animals.

Reflecting on a first-time experience at a UN meeting, author Juliet Perry noted the complexity, the jargon, and the circular nature of the discussions. However, there is optimism in seeing nations collaborate and in the lobbying efforts of NGOs like Greenpeace.

This issue is relevant to everyone, especially to the vulnerable developing countries already experiencing the effects of climate change. As these impacts are felt, we must demand clear action. A UN report has provided a source of hope, and there is a way for the public to get involved. You can use the hashtag #TakeYourSeat in your tweets, which will be incorporated into an address delivered by David Attenborough.
