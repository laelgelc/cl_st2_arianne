From aboard the Greenpeace ship Arctic Sunrise, Carl Safina is in the high Arctic near Svalbard, documenting how shrinking sea ice and warming waters are drawing fish and fishing vessels northward.

He is witnessing the effects of trawling, a practice that often involves dragging nets across the seafloor like ocean bulldozers. This method leads to overfishing and results in a massive bycatch of unwanted species. Trawling also causes seafloor destabilization, the destruction of coral, and harm to delicate creatures like anemones and sponges. By crushing life on the seabed, it reduces fish habitats and their sources of food.

To protect the ocean, Safina advocates for the establishment of trawl-free zones. He notes a recent agreement has been made with retailers and fishing companies to halt the expansion of trawling until protections are put in place. This underscores a moral responsibility to safeguard the ocean for future generations.
