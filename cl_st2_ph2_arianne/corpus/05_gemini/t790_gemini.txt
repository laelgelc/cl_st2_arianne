Our ship, the Arctic Sunrise, is sailing south for a three-month expedition to advocate for the creation of an Antarctic Ocean Sanctuary. If successful, this would become the world's largest protected area, covering an area six times the size of Italy.

Aboard the ship, a team of campaigners, scientists, and journalists will explore seabed habitats and document the impacts of fishing on wildlife like penguins and whales. The journey will highlight the threats facing the region, including overfishing, plastic pollution, and climate change.

A crucial decision will be made in October 2018, when leaders from 24 countries and the EU meet to vote on the sanctuary proposal. We are urging our supporters to sign and share the petition to help persuade these politicians to act. Healthy oceans are vital for sustaining wildlife, supporting livelihoods, and maintaining the health of our planet.
