Inspired by Greta Thunberg, 16-year-old Minneapolis student Isra Hirsi is co-leading the US Youth Climate Strike. The movement has planned strikes for March 15, set to take place in 47 countries and nearly all 50 states.

Hirsi has been involved in activism since the first grade, but her work became more serious in high school. Motivated by the Flint crisis and the Line 3 pipeline, she joined her school's green team and the MN Can’t Wait coalition. This youth-led movement, which is dominated by young women of color, is demanding urgent climate action, including measures like the Green New Deal.

For these students, striking means risking their education to fight for real change. Despite the stress involved, young people are organizing, and their actions mean that adults must confront their own discomfort.
