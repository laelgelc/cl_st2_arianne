From Japan to Europe and California, recent extreme weather events are clear evidence of human-induced climate change. Floods, heatwaves, and typhoons have struck Japan, while Europe has endured heatwaves and California has battled wildfires. These events are driven by CO2 emissions and shifts in the jet stream.

The human cost is tragic, with children losing their lives in both Japan and Greece, and firefighters dying in California. Beyond these immediate disasters, the wider impacts of our changing climate are accelerating. Antarctic ice is melting at an increasing rate, and ancient trees are dying.

The world is not on track to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement and is instead heading toward 3°C of warming. However, an upcoming IPCC report will stress the critical importance of limiting warming to 1.5°C. Achieving this requires significant shifts away from fossil fuels, alongside protections for our oceans, forests, and farming systems. We must urge our leaders to take immediate action for climate justice.
