The plastic pollution crisis is harming wildlife, human health, and the environment. This damage is caused by microplastics and toxins. While there is a need to reduce plastic production, the industry is planning to expand.

The Break Free From Plastic movement conducted brand audits in 2018, which were based on volunteer cleanups. These audits identified top polluters including Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, and Nestlé. Companies are making promises to reduce their impact, but these promises fall short.

To hold corporations accountable, you can participate in larger brand audits during World Cleanup Day on September 21. A toolkit is available for this purpose. You are invited to register for an event to join this global movement.
