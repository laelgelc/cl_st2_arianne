Recent oil spills in Thailand, Peru, Ecuador, and Nigeria have been causing environmental devastation, leading to wildlife deaths and harming communities. A looming threat of another spill in Yemen highlights the ongoing global danger.

The impact of oil extends into wars, conflicts, and the arms trade, with Russia's military being funded by fossil fuels. Amid these crises, oil companies such as BP, Shell, and Exxon are profiting. These corporations engage in greenwashing, despite oil's toxicity throughout its entire lifecycle and its role in driving climate change.

For years, the industry ignored warnings and actively funded denial of the climate crisis. The air pollution that results from burning fossil fuels kills millions of people annually. The major firms responsible are climate criminals. It is imperative to end the age of fossil fuels and transition to renewable energy.
