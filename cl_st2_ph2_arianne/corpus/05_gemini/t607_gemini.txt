The UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues is addressing the rights of indigenous peoples to free, prior, and informed consent, a right often ignored by the oil industry.

In Numto village in Western Siberia, Khanty and Nenets reindeer herders are facing environmental threats from oil drilling conducted by the company Surgutneftegas. These threats include the destruction of land, the potential for oil spills, and the isolation of the community.

Residents have expressed feeling imprisoned. Access for journalists is restricted, and consultations with the community have been described as shams. Furthermore, officials who opposed the re-zoning of land within the protected Numto Natural Park have faced retaliatory firings.

We urge you to share this story and contact Surgutneftegas about this situation.
