On the 30th anniversary of the French government's bombing of the Rainbow Warrior in Auckland, Greenpeace commemorated the event that sank the ship and killed photographer Fernando Pereira. The vessel was sunk by limpet mines.

Recently, agent Jean-Luc Kister offered an apology in interviews, confirming the attack was an act of deliberate violence against protests of French nuclear testing. Jean-François Julliard of Greenpeace France stated that the bombing ultimately failed to stop the courage of the movement.

Captain Pete Willcox accepted the agent's apology but criticized the French government for its lack of official remorse. He labeled the bombing as state-sponsored terrorism and questioned whether claims of incompetence were a cover for indifference.
