The Brent Spar, an oil storage tank built in 1976, was made redundant by 1980. Inside, it held a dangerous mix of crude oil, PCBs, heavy metals, and radioactive waste. In 1991, Shell decided on a plan for its disposal: to dump it directly into the North Sea. This proposal, approved by the UK government, was intended as a cost-saving test case for future disposals.

In 1995, Greenpeace launched a campaign to stop this from happening. Our activists occupied the spar, took samples of its toxic contents, and led protests with the clear message that "The sea is not a dustbin."

The campaign captured public attention, leading to widespread media coverage, consumer boycotts of Shell, and significant international pressure. This collective action worked. Shell was forced to reverse its decision, and the Brent Spar was instead moored in Norway.

The impact of this victory was profound. It led directly to the 1998 OSPAR convention ban on dumping oil and gas installations in the North Sea. The spar itself was eventually repurposed, its components used to create the foundation for a ferry terminal. This campaign marked a pivotal victory for the protection of our oceans.
