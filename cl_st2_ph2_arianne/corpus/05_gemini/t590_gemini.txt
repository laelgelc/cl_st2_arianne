In the face of a climate emergency, Greenpeace activists are protesting a BP oil rig located in Scotland's Cromarty Firth. The action criticises BP's greenwashing and its rhetoric on the Paris Agreement, which stands in contrast to its ongoing pursuit of new oil extraction.

The protest began on June 9th when activists boarded the rig, hanging a banner that read "Climate Emergency." They occupied the rig for days, persisting even after police removals and the issuing of injunctions.

After the rig was towed out into the North Sea, the Greenpeace ship, the Arctic Sunrise, pursued it. This confrontation led to the oil rig making an unexpected U-turn and returning to Scotland.

As the action at sea continued, solidarity protests took place at BP stations. There are now calls for global support to stop any further drilling.
