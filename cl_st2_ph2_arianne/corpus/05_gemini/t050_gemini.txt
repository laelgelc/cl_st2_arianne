An equitable and sustainable future is impossible without recognizing the deep interconnection between climate justice and social justice. Climate change acts as a crisis multiplier, exacerbating existing inequalities. It disproportionately harms the very communities who have contributed the least to the crisis, including low-income countries, people of color, Indigenous Peoples, women, and those with disabilities.

These vulnerable communities are on the frontlines, facing devastating disasters, resource scarcity, and staggering loss and damage costs, which are projected to reach between 290 and 580 billion US dollars annually by 2030. The driver of this crisis is clear: fossil fuels are responsible for over 75% of all greenhouse gas emissions.

Addressing this requires a just phase-out of fossil fuels and a fundamental shift away from extractive economies towards people-centered models. Polluters must be held accountable for the damage they have caused. This is not a distant threat. In the Middle East and North Africa region, for instance, Greenpeace has documented how escalating warming, droughts, and floods are worsening social injustices. These climate impacts threaten the region’s vital ecosystems, people's livelihoods, and their cultural heritage.
