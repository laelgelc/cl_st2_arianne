After discovering microplastics in 170 different types of seafood, Greenpeace East Asia investigated a key source of this pollution by testing 30 major cosmetic brands. We ranked these companies on their commitments to eliminate microbeads—the tiny plastics used in products like exfoliants that pollute oceans, harm marine life, and find their way into the food chain.

Our investigation found that corporate pledges are falling short. Brands' promises often have loopholes created by varying definitions of microplastics, which allows for their continued use. In fact, none of the 30 brands we reviewed met full environmental standards. Even the top-scoring companies, such as Beiersdorf, have only removed polyethylene, while ignoring other plastics.

The most effective solution is for governments to implement comprehensive bans on all solid microplastics in personal care products, similar to the ban enacted in the US. While we push for this systemic change, consumers can use apps and guides to help them avoid purchasing products containing microplastics.
