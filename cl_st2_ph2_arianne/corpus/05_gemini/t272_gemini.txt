My experiences as a Greenpeace photographer from 1974 to 1982 are evoked by a dozen photographs. These images bring back memories of confronting Russian whaling fleets and the distinct challenges of photography from Zodiac boats. In an era of pre-internet communication, we were guided by Hunter's "mind-bomb" theory, which centered on creating social change through powerful images.

I recall key figures from that time, including Captain John Cormack and activists such as Bree Drummond and Bobbi Hunter. Fundraising was a constant effort, supported by events like a benefit concert by Jerry Garcia. The memories span from our early offices to our international expansion in Amsterdam. The interactions among the crew were a central part of the experience, which ultimately led to the creation of an iconic anti-whaling image. These reflections also include thoughts on ecological transitions and how they affect people's livelihoods.
