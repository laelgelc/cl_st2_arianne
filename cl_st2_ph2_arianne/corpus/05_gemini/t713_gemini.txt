Inspired by a documentation trip, Greenpeace staff in Helsinki have been discussing the stunning beauty and the logging devastation they witnessed in the Great Northern Forest.

This vast forest stretches across Canada, Scandinavia, and Russia. It holds nearly a quarter of the world's trees and stores more carbon than all of the world's tropical rainforests combined. The forest is home to Indigenous peoples, such as the Sami and the Cree, as well as diverse wildlife.

Currently, only 3% of the Great Northern Forest is protected. Logging is turning this critical ecosystem into disposable products, creating a risk that it could become a carbon bomb. We urge for the protection of this forest to help combat climate change. To allow people to experience its wonders and understand the threats it faces, we are offering an AR app experience through Arilyn, where you can virtually explore the forest.
