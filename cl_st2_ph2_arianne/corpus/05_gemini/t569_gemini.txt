Our Ocean Ambassadors, a group of artists, actors, scientists, explorers, and others, are united by the message that we have a shared responsibility to protect Earth’s fragile places. They are advocating for the creation of a strong Global Ocean Treaty, which would allow for a vast network of new ocean sanctuaries worldwide.

These protected areas are essential to safeguard whales, turtles, dolphins, and other marine life from the threats of climate change, pollution, and overfishing. Healthy oceans are not only vital for wildlife; they also affect people globally. By cycling carbon, they help to mitigate the impacts of climate change, and they are crucial for ensuring food security for billions of people.
