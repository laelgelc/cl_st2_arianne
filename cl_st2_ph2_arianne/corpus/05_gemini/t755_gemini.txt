Our beaches are suffering under a tide of plastic pollution. From tiny microplastics to the all-too-familiar sight of plastic bags and cups, our sand and surf are being contaminated. We all have a right to clean water, free from plastic, and 2018 must be the year we break free from this crisis.

The problem stems from single-use plastics, produced by companies like Coca-Cola and Nestlé. These items are filling our oceans, choking marine life, and even making their way into our drinking water and the food we eat.

While recycling is often presented as the solution, it is simply not enough. An overwhelming majority of plastic—over 90%—is never recycled, and all the while, production continues to rise. The responsibility lies with the corporations at the source. They must reduce their massive plastic output.

You can be part of the solution. We invite you to join a growing global movement by signing petitions and using new tools that will be available soon to demand change.
