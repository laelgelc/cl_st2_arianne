Amid record-breaking heat waves and fires, a scientific paper has issued a stark warning of a potential "Hothouse Earth." The paper explains that climate feedbacks could cause a runaway heating effect that goes beyond human control.

This warning comes as the Paris Accord is critiqued for being non-binding and ineffective. Despite international pledges, conferences, and laws, emissions are still rising. Projections now suggest the world is on a path to 3-4°C of warming.

Experts have highlighted issues such as scholarly reticence and ongoing policy failures. They also point to the impossibility of decoupling economic growth from the use of fossil fuels, and have urged for reduced consumption and population growth.

The situation has prompted responses, including the resignation of a French minister. Young activists are also taking action through protests, lawsuits, and strikes.
