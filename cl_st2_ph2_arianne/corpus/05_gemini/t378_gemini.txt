Amid intersecting crises of climate disasters, the COVID-19 pandemic, and social injustice, governments are using public money to bail out the polluting airline industry. This is a critical mistake when these funds should instead be directed towards green investments like railways, biking, walking, and public transport.

The aviation industry is a significant and growing source of pollution, with its CO2 emissions increasing by 26% between 2013 and 2018. The sector already benefits from major market distortions, operating with tax exemptions on kerosene and plane tickets. In stark contrast, sustainable alternatives like railways are subjected to high taxes.

Despite this, European governments have already handed out over €30 billion in bailouts to airlines, attaching only minimal environmental or social conditions to this financial support.

As we navigate a second wave of COVID-19, a different path is essential. We need a drastic reduction in the number of flights and a phase-out of short-haul routes where better alternatives exist. Any public support must come with robust protections for workers and a clear plan for a just transition.
