The Amazon rainforest is shrinking, succumbing to rampant deforestation and intentional fires. This destruction is not accidental; it is overwhelmingly driven by agribusiness and the global demand for meat. A shocking 75% of all deforested public lands in the Amazon are converted into cattle pastures.

The fires that ravage the forest are frequently illegal, often set by land grabbers to clear land. This activity poses an immense threat to Indigenous peoples, the region's unparalleled biodiversity, and the stability of the global climate. The situation has been exacerbated by policy; under Bolsonaro's anti-environment administration, deforestation surged by 52.9%. The crisis is accelerating, with fires increasing by 16.7% in early 2022 alone.

This relentless pressure is pushing the Amazon toward a critical tipping point. Scientists warn that a loss of 20-25% of the forest could trigger its irreversible transformation into a savanna.

However, solutions exist to halt this devastation. We must demand the enforcement of environmental laws, support the creation of new protected areas, and ensure the full recognition of Indigenous rights. Critically, the global food system must be reformed to prevent our consumption from continuing to fuel the destruction of our planet's most vital ecosystems.
