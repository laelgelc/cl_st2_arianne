The logging giant Resolute Forest Products is suing Greenpeace entities and Stand.Earth in what Greenpeace warns is an attempt to silence advocacy for forests, oceans, and the climate.

For years, Greenpeace has been campaigning to protect the Great Northern Forest from unsustainable logging. This campaigning has prompted changes from companies like Kimberly Clark. Resolute, however, has refused solutions and instead launched major lawsuits.

In response, supporters from around the world are recording their voices saying "our voices are vital" to counter this. As the number of recordings reached 10,000, several milestones were marked. These included the release of videos from Mark Deklin, Emma Thompson, Tamra Davis, and Jennette McCurdy. Additionally, a song was released by Yon Yonson, and digital backgrounds were created by artist Hannah Rosengren.
