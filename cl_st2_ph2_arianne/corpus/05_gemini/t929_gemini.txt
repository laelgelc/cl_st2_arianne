Since 2014, Chiara Milford has avoided buying new clothes, choosing instead to use items that are second-hand, inherited, or borrowed. She embraces clothes that are already worn and upcycles them. She highlights the benefits of thrift-shopping, such as affordability and finding unique items, but notes that it can be challenging to find specific things.

To reduce the need for new production, she uses social media to promote clothes swapping. Milford suggests setting personal goals, such as not buying anything on Black Friday or committing to wear an item more than 30 times. She critiques the environmental harm caused by disposable fashion. To achieve a sustainable style, she advocates for fixing, altering, and cherishing the clothes already in our wardrobes.
