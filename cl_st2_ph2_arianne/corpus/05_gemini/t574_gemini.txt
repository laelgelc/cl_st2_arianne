An Instagram #DrawThisInYourStyle challenge is inviting artists to illustrate the Lost City, a unique hydrothermal vent site discovered 20 years ago. Located 750 meters deep in the Atlantic Ocean, it resembles an abandoned metropolis.

The site holds scientific significance and potential clues to the origins of life. However, it is threatened by deep sea mining for rare earth minerals, which could irreversibly damage its ecosystems.

To showcase its beauty and strangeness, artists including Quentin Blake and Charlie Adlard initiated the challenge. They are urging participants to use the hashtags #TheLostCityInYourStyle and #ProtectTheOceans. The challenge also asks people to sign a petition for a Global Ocean Treaty and to learn about ocean protection.
