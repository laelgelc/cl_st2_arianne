Tuna's popularity is on the rise, celebrated as an affordable and nutritious food. Trends like #TinnedFishDateNight have even boosted its profile. But behind this convenient meal lies a story of severe human and environmental costs.

Greenpeace investigations and reports such as *Choppy Waters* have uncovered forced labor on distant-water fishing vessels. Workers face grueling 20-hour workdays, poor nutrition, the withholding of wages, and have their passports confiscated.

The damage extends deep into our oceans. Tuna stocks are overfished, with a third being fished at biologically unsustainable levels. Fishing methods like longlining and purse seining with Fish Aggregating Devices (FADs) result in high levels of bycatch, harming other vital marine life.

Faced with this reality, consumers have a crucial role. We must choose sustainable options and pressure our governments to implement and enforce ethical fisheries management.
