Rosatom's Akademik Lomonosov, the world's first floating nuclear power plant, is being towed to the Arctic where it will be used to power fossil fuel extraction.

This operation presents numerous risks, including the potential for seawater explosions and hydrogen blasts. An incident could result in the radioactive contamination of marine wildlife and crucial fish stocks, with these dangers being significantly worsened by the harsh Arctic conditions. There is a history of nuclear incidents involving submarines and icebreakers, and the planned introduction of entire fleets of these floating plants will only increase the risk of future accidents.

Nuclear waste from the plant will be stored onboard for years, and there is no secure plan for its eventual disposal on land. The plant itself lacks independent oversight and is vulnerable to natural disasters like tsunamis and cyclones. It is also exposed to the risks of collision, flooding, sinking, or grounding, any of which could potentially lead to a devastating leak of radiation into the marine environment.
