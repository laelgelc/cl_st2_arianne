The International Seabed Authority (ISA) is in the process of finalising regulations that would allow for commercial deep sea mining. The claim that minerals from the deep sea are necessary for renewable technologies has been refuted by reports which show that terrestrial resources are sufficient.

This new form of mining risks causing severe and permanent environmental damage. The consequences include habitat destruction and the loss of biodiversity in largely unexplored ecosystems.

The ISA itself operates with a lack of transparency and has rejected the formation of an environmental committee. Despite this, the authority has already approved 28 exploration contracts, which cover vast areas of the seabed.

Opposition to this emerging industry is growing. This includes local resistance to projects like Nautilus Minerals' Solwara I in Papua New Guinea. The European Parliament has called for a moratorium on the practice, and a movement of 800,000 supporters is urging for a ban to protect our deep sea environments.
