In May, as a record-breaking heatwave pushed temperatures up to 45°C, Israel was confronted with over 1000 wildfires. These fires, attributed to climate change, resulted in evacuations and the loss of homes.

The climate breakdown is directly responsible for exacerbating the intensity of these fires by creating higher temperatures, more frequent heat waves, and drier conditions. The Middle East is warming at an alarming rate of 1.5°C, which is 50% above the global average. A recent study warns that by the end of the century, the region will face longer summers and shorter winters, further increasing the risks of droughts and wildfires.

To address this escalating crisis, Greenpeace urges an immediate halt to all fossil fuel prospecting in the Mediterranean and a transition to renewable energy.

There are also preventative measures everyone can take. It is crucial to extinguish all cigarettes and fires properly and to never leave flames unattended. If you see a wildfire, report it to the authorities promptly. In terms of safety, you should evacuate the area in the event of a forest fire. For smaller grass fires, attempt to smother them if it is safe to do so, and always warn your neighbors of the danger.
