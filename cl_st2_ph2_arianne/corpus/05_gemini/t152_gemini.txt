Protecting our oceans is about more than just marine life; it is fundamentally about protecting people. Over 3 billion people, particularly in the Global South, rely on the oceans for their livelihoods, their food, and their cultural connections.

This vital relationship is threatened by destructive industries. Industrial fishing, for example, depletes fish stocks and devastates coastal communities. A fisherman in Nigeria has spoken of his struggles with schooling and the cost of living as a direct result of these practices. Furthermore, this industry is known to exploit migrant workers, who are subjected to violence and long shifts.

The oceans are also a critical ally in the fight against climate change, absorbing 20-30% of our emissions. However, their continued exploitation puts this essential function at risk. To safeguard the high seas and the people who depend on them, please sign the petition for a strong Global Ocean Treaty.
