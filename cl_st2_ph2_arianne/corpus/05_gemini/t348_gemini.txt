In Poland, climate activists are facing accusations of breaking environmental law for using megaphones during Fridays for Future demonstrations. The protests took place at the December European Council summit, where activists were demanding that the EU increase its 2030 greenhouse gas reduction targets.

At least five of the activists facing accusations are over the age of 18. Underage participants in the demonstrations have been assigned special guardians. Some of these younger activists have experienced police visits at their homes, received court summons, and been subjected to checks by probation officers.

The activists report feeling stress, uncertainty, and a sense of repression due to these actions. The potential consequences they face are severe and could include being sent to reform school. This is occurring in a national context of high intimidation, set against a backdrop of Poland's dependency on coal and a high number of deaths linked to air pollution.

In response to the situation, the activists plan to appeal to foreign embassies for support.
