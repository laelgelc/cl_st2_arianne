Inspired by the #MeToo movement, Greenpeace International's Executive Directors, Jennifer Morgan and Bunny McDiarmid, have emphasised the necessity of creating safe workplaces through robust systems and an inclusive culture.

A global Integrity Package has been adopted, featuring a Code of Conduct and specific complaint protocols. In line with this, Greenpeace offices are upgrading their processes and will implement annual reporting on complaints. The objective is to cultivate a culture defined by equity, empowerment, training, and diversity, ensuring everyone has access to trusted officers.

This commitment is considered central to the Greenpeace mission, drawing a direct link between the treatment of people and the protection of the planet. It is acknowledged that this is an ongoing process and that improvements are continuously needed.
