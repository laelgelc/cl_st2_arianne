From aboard the Esperanza, Greenpeace is highlighting how human activities are devastating the oceans, with a particular focus on destructive shark fishing. Campaigner Will McCallum reports from a fishing ground where as many as 25,000 endangered sharks are killed each year. In this area, sharks are caught four times more often than swordfish, and they are killed mostly for their fins.

Our team documented a longliner vessel as it hauled in eight sharks and just one swordfish, an act that exposes the failure of current ocean management. We are joined on our ship by low-impact fisherman Jerry Percy, who helps to emphasize the impacts this industry has on coastal communities.

This is why Greenpeace is calling for a Global Ocean Treaty. Such a treaty would limit shark catches and create a network of ocean sanctuaries. As scientists recommend, these protected areas would safeguard marine life from industrial fishing and drilling.
