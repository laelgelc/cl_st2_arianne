Carbon offsetting is a scam and a greenwashing tool. It allows companies and governments to continue polluting while claiming they are achieving emission reductions. This is done through projects, such as forest protection, that commodify nature and harm Indigenous communities. Crucially, this approach distracts from the need for actual emission cuts.

The concept of 'net zero' is a deceptive bookkeeping trick. It relies on these offsets and ignores the urgent need for immediate reductions in the use of fossil fuels. The alternative is to pursue 'real zero' emissions.

Offsetting is a con driven by greed. It feigns compassion, preys on fear, and exploits uncertainty. For these reasons, there are calls to reject carbon offsetting at COP26 and under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement.
