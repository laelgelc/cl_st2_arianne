Litigations between Resolute Forest Products and Greenpeace entities have concluded, with reference to a joint statement. It is important to continue speaking up to pressure companies on their impacts on forests. Companies like Kimberly-Clark, Procter & Gamble, Hewlett-Packard, and 3M have adopted policies that challenge suppliers like Resolute.

Greenpeace challenges Rite Aid, a major customer of Resolute, to implement a meaningful paper policy. Despite outreach, Rite Aid ignores the links between its products and forest destruction. We are calling for the public to send messages to Rite Aid via social media.

The Boreal Forest plays a critical role in carbon absorption, is a home for biodiversity, and contains Indigenous territories. It is threatened by Resolute's logging, which destroys caribou habitat and involves non-consensual operations. There is an ongoing lawsuit against Greenpeace Canada.
