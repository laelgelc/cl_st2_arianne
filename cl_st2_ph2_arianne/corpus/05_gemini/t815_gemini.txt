French and Belgian nuclear plants have vulnerabilities that make them a "Sword of Damocles" due to the risks they face from outside attacks. A report by independent experts has been submitted to authorities in France, Belgium, Germany, Switzerland, and Luxembourg, which criticizes the poor protection of spent fuel storage pools.

These pools contain large quantities of radioactive material. Unlike the reinforced reactor buildings, the pools are inadequately secured against modern threats, such as those posed by criminals or isolated individuals in a post-9/11 context. If one of these pools were damaged, it could lose its cooling water, resulting in the release of massive amounts of radioactivity.

We are urging the plant operators, EDF and Engie-Electrabel, to enhance security. Due to the sensitive nature of the information, the full report is being withheld, but an executive summary has been made available.
