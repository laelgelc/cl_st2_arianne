Greenpeace's origins are connected to the 1971 Amchitka nuclear protest, during which the crew of the Phyllis Cormack had interactions with Kwakwaka’wakw communities in ‘Yalis. In these interactions, the crew received blessings, were ceremonially adopted, and were given a Sisiutl crest as a gift.

This sacred symbol, which represents balance and protection, was later altered and hybridized for use in Greenpeace's anti-whaling campaign. This act constituted cultural appropriation.

In 2015, in an effort to correct narratives and retire the old version, Greenpeace collaborated with Kwakwaka’wakw artist Beau Dick to redesign the symbol. A renewal potlatch ceremony was held where apologies were made. Following this, a ship was blessed with the new flag.
