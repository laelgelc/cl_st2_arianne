To address the climate crisis, we must phase out diesel and petrol vehicles within the next decade. In Europe, the transport sector is responsible for over a quarter of all CO2 emissions, and road transport alone accounts for 45% of that.

Research conducted by the Ecologic Institute and Greenpeace Germany has identified six key policy measures to accelerate this transition. The first is to implement a ban on the sale of new internal combustion engine cars while mandating production quotas for electric vehicles (EVs). This must be supported by the expansion of a subsidized charging infrastructure to make EVs a viable option for everyone.

Furthermore, policies should be flexible, with incentives that adapt to changing market trends. A mix of policies, including both subsidies and mandates, is necessary for a successful transition. This approach should involve taxing polluters while offering incentives for the adoption of EVs. Crucially, the benefits of this shift must be clearly communicated to the public.

It is important to recognise that electric vehicles are part of a much broader solution. The ultimate goal is a systemic shift towards reducing the overall number of personal cars on our roads. This involves boosting public transport powered by renewable energy, and making it easier and safer for people to choose cycling and walking.
