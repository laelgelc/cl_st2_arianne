Amid the current energy crisis, women disproportionately suffer from economic instability. Despite playing a key role in household energy use, they are often excluded from decision-making processes.

Women are more environmentally friendly, more supportive of renewables, and their presence in leadership is linked to better environmental outcomes. However, they are significantly underrepresented in positions of power, holding only 26.8% of environment minister roles in the EU and just 12% of leadership positions in the energy sector.

This imbalance is compounded by energy poverty, which affects women globally and exacerbates gender inequality. The consequences include severe health risks, such as exposure to toxic smoke, and a greater number of excess winter deaths. For a just transition to be achieved, access to affordable clean energy is a human right, and it is crucial to implement gender-sensitive policies.
