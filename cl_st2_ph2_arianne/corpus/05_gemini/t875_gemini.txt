A significant step forward for our oceans has been taken with US President Obama's announcement of the world’s largest ocean sanctuary. This comes at a crucial time, as governments are meeting at the United Nations to develop a treaty for protecting the high seas.

The need for action is urgent. Currently, less than 1% of the high seas are protected. Scientists recommend that at least 30% of our oceans must be protected to revive marine life, rebuild fish stocks, and help combat climate change. Despite a commitment from governments to protect 10% by 2020, most are lagging behind their targets.

This is why Greenpeace is advocating for strong sanctuary rules. The benefits of establishing these protected areas are immense. They can result in the quadrupling of biomass and a major increase in biodiversity. Healthy oceans also boost economies by supporting tourism and fisheries. Furthermore, they enhance climate resilience through their capacity for carbon storage.

While progress is being made, more work is needed to secure a robust UN deal that will give our oceans the protection they need.
