On World Food Day, we are highlighting the celebrations of food lovers everywhere. We assert that organic, local, and seasonal food that is beneficial for both people and the planet is a human right. This right should be accessible to everyone, including farmers in Argentina, city dwellers in France, children in the Philippines, and foodies in the USA.

We urge governments to take action to make ecological food available at fair prices for consumers and for the farmers who grow it.

While we push for this systemic change, personal action is also powerful. We have five fun ideas for how you can get involved. You can buy and distribute ecological produce, host meals with it, or cook for those in need. You could also volunteer at local farms or community gardens. Finally, you can pursue further actions to help reform the food system. We also invite you to share your own suggestions.
