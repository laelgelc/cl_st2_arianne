Ariene Susuí, a Wapishana campaigner for Greenpeace Brazil, describes feeling a profound sadness while flying over Munduruku and Kayapó Indigenous Lands to document the impacts of illegal mining. She saw vast pits and devastation that looked like mud where life once thrived.

This experience brought back warnings from her childhood and stories from leaders about invasion and disease, reinforcing her understanding of the land as sacred. She condemns mining as an indefensible crime. It is a practice that destroys forests, pollutes rivers, and ends Indigenous lives, all for the sake of gold. This illegal mining is fueled by heavy machinery, including Hyundai excavators.

For Ariene Susuí, the gold extracted from these lands is bathed in Indigenous blood. She calls for action against this destruction and for the creation of alternative economic models that preserve life.
