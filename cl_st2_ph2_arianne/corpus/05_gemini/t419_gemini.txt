Greenpeace Japan conducted an interview with Hiroshi Harada, a survivor of the atomic bomb. At just six years old, he was at Hiroshima station during the bombing and managed to escape the flames and rubble with his father.

Later in life, as the director of the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum, Harada navigated significant challenges. He was involved in loaning museum artifacts to an exhibition in the United States that was ultimately cancelled because of resistance. He also worked to secure UNESCO World Heritage status for the Genbaku Dome, a move that was met with opposition from America and China.

Harada now stresses the urgency of preserving the fading memories of survivors. He believes it is essential to connect with these experiences to fully convey the horrors of nuclear weapons and to prevent their use in the future.
