The passing of climate scientist Wallace Smith Broecker marks a poignant moment. As far back as 1975, he predicted global warming, a warning that has now become a lived reality. His death symbolizes a generational shift, as the scientific predictions of the past are replaced by the urgent demands of the present.

A new generation is rising. Youth-led school strikes, inspired by Greta Thunberg, are demanding the urgent action that has been denied for too long. They are striking because the impacts of the climate crisis, such as extreme weather, are no longer abstract threats but visible realities.

This youth movement is responding to a crisis that can no longer be ignored. The IPCC has issued a stark warning: we have just 12 years to avert chaos. This requires halving CO2 emissions by 2030 and reaching net zero by 2050.

Yet, despite the existence of the Paris Agreement and the rules established at COP24, political inaction persists. Temperatures continue to rise and we witness record heat, clear signs that current commitments are not enough. It is time to stand in solidarity with the striking youth. We must demand bolder commitments from our leaders to match the scale of the crisis we face.
