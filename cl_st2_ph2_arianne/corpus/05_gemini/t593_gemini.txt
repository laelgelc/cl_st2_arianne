Young people worldwide, including millennials, are protesting and suing governments for their inaction on the climate crisis. They are demanding intergenerational justice and their equal right to a safe future.

These legal challenges are achieving success. In Colombia, the Supreme Court ruled that Amazon deforestation is a violation of human rights. Lawsuits are also ongoing in the United States and in Canada's Quebec province, where youth argue that government policies infringe upon their constitutional and equality rights. Furthermore, courts in the Netherlands and New Zealand have affirmed that the judiciary has the authority to rule on climate issues.

Youth are combining these legal actions with powerful mobilizations, such as the #FridaysForFuture movement, to challenge the status quo and hold leaders accountable.
