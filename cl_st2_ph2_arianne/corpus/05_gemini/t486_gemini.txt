Our oceans provide the oxygen we breathe, food for millions, and vital protection against climate change. To safeguard these critical functions, Greenpeace, in collaboration with scientists, is proposing a rescue plan. The plan calls for the establishment of a global network of ocean sanctuaries covering at least 30% of our planet's oceans by 2030.

Within these sanctuaries, destructive activities such as fishing, mining, and drilling would be banned. The specific locations for these protected zones would be selected using scientific data on habitats, species, and the impacts of a changing climate.

This initiative is designed to be more than just a line on a map. Unlike ineffective "paper parks," these sanctuaries would be governed by strict rules and robust enforcement. This would be made possible through a new UN body operating under a new Global Ocean Treaty. The creation of these sanctuaries would enhance the abundance of marine life and strengthen the oceans' resilience to threats like climate change and pollution.

To overcome opposition from industry and secure a strong treaty, widespread public support is needed.
