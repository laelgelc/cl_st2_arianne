In the state of Rondônia, Brazil, the Karipuna Indigenous people are facing severe threats. With only 58 members remaining, their community is at risk as illegal loggers and land grabbers invade their protected Amazon territory. This land, spanning 152,930 hectares, was officially ratified for their protection in 1998.

Their territory is now surrounded by deforestation and cattle farms. The Karipuna people endure death threats in what is known as the deadliest country for environmental defenders. Their vulnerability was recently exacerbated when a local office of FUNAI, the government's Indigenous affairs agency, was burned down. In early 2017 alone, over 1,000 hectares of their forest were deforested.

To combat these invasions, the Karipuna are collaborating with Greenpeace Brazil and the Indigenist Missionary Council (CIMI), utilizing satellite monitoring to track the illegal activity. To escalate their fight for survival, their leader, Adriano, will travel to New York to address the United Nations. His aim is to amplify the plight of his people, seeking to protect both their community and their forest.
