Greenpeace campaigns against the use of chemical pesticides in agriculture, as they are unnecessary. Across the globe, ecological pest management has proven to be successful.

A review of the literature reveals the grim health impacts of industrial farming's routine pesticide use. This practice exposes farmers, their families, and the public to these chemicals, which are linked to a range of serious health issues. These include cancers, neurodegenerative diseases, and disruptions to the immune and hormone systems. The consequences also extend to birth defects and developmental issues, with pregnant women and children being especially vulnerable. Furthermore, some individuals may have genetic vulnerabilities, and there is evidence of intergenerational effects.

Proving direct causation between a specific pesticide and a health condition is challenging because people are typically exposed to multiple chemicals.

The solution is to shift to ecological farming. This will provide healthy food and protect people from exposure to harmful chemicals. We urge everyone to join the food movement.
