Emma Mederic, a 23-year-old Seychellois conservationist, works to protect Aldabra Atoll, a UNESCO marine World Heritage Site. As the Assistant Aldabra Science Coordinator with the Seychelles Islands Foundation (SIF), she is based in a natural laboratory teeming with diverse species such as giant tortoises, green turtles, and dugongs.

The SIF has managed the atoll since 1979, operating a research station that was first established in 1971. This work promotes evidence-based conservation and is notable for its commitment to gender diversity, which has included all-female teams.

Despite these efforts, Aldabra faces significant threats from climate change, pollution, and unsustainable fisheries. From her position on the front lines, Emma urges a global response. She calls for people to reduce their ecological footprints and for an end to fossil fuels. She also stresses the need to support a Global Ocean Treaty, which is essential to safeguard not only Aldabra but also the biodiversity of the high seas.
