As part of the Ocean Defenders Campaign, the Greenpeace ship Esperanza is documenting the scale of plastic pollution in the North Pacific garbage patch. On Kahuku beach, the crew has found items like toothbrushes washed up on the shore.

Plastic is a material that can last for over 500 years. Every piece of plastic that has ever been produced still exists today. This has led to the formation of a patch of ocean debris that is now larger than France. This pollution harms wildlife; for example, birds have been observed using plastic to build their nests. Plastic damages the planet at every stage of its life, from the extraction of fossil fuels used to make it, to the toxins it can release, and its impact on sea life.

The history of plastic began in the 19th century, when it was created as a substitute for ivory in billiard balls. Its development was advanced by mass production and World War II, which was followed by a postwar consumer boom. To address this crisis, we must reduce our use of plastic through actions like using reusable bags and avoiding microbeads.
