Climate change undermines our fundamental human rights. It threatens our rights to health, food, water, housing, work, and life itself, with vulnerable populations being disproportionately affected.

We are calling for urgent action and for justice. Governments must be held accountable and corporations must take responsibility. The solutions to this crisis already exist, from renewable energy to a foundation of respect for human rights.

Around the world, people are mobilizing. Students, Indigenous Peoples, workers, and activists are all raising their voices.

To unite these movements, the People’s Summit on Climate, Rights and Human Survival will take place on September 18-19 in New York. This event, organized by civil society and the UN Human Rights Office, will bring together the human rights and environmental communities to push for climate justice.
