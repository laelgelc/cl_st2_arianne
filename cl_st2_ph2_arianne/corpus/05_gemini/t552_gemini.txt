Between Brazil and French Guiana lies the Amazon Reef, a vital and diverse ecosystem. It features a unique reef system located at depths of up to 200 meters. In 2018, this area was the site of a victory where 2 million people successfully campaigned against the oil giant Total.

The reef is now threatened by the oil company BP, which has been making efforts to drill in the region since 2016. Potential oil spills from such activities could cause devastation that extends beyond Brazil, impacting mangroves, the reef itself, and species including whales and turtles. Drilling would also exacerbate the climate crisis.

Governments now have an opportunity to protect this area by adopting a strong Global Ocean Treaty. To highlight the reef's importance and urge action against oil companies, Greenpeace's Pole to Pole expedition will spend five weeks documenting the area.
