We are in a biodiversity crisis. One million species are threatened with extinction due to deforestation, overfishing, and resource extraction.

The Convention on Biological Diversity has suffered from weak implementation, and there is a need for clear mechanisms to address this. At COP15, rich countries in the Global North must provide funding for ecosystem protection in the Global South. A $700 billion finance gap needs to be closed, which can be achieved by redirecting harmful subsidies.

Key demands include the recognition of Indigenous Peoples' rights, who are the stewards of 80% of the world's remaining biodiversity. The approach of fortress conservation must be rejected. A 30x30 target should be adopted to conserve 30% of land and water by 2030, with Indigenous and local communities at the center of this effort.
