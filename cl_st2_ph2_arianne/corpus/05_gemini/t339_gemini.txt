For the third year in a row, global brand audits have identified Coca-Cola, Nestlé, and PepsiCo as the top plastic polluters. These corporations continue to invest in false solutions and partner with oil companies to produce even more plastic.

The connection between plastic and the climate crisis is clear. Plastic is made from 99% fossil fuels and is toxic throughout its lifecycle. With only 2% of plastic being recycled circularly, we cannot rely on recycling to solve this problem. It is imperative that these companies end their reliance on single-use plastic packaging. They must shift away from fossil fuels and support regulations that will reduce their plastic footprint and help combat climate change.

Millions of people are demanding this change. Through petitions, lobbying, and community actions, a growing movement is pushing for a future based on refill and reuse systems.
