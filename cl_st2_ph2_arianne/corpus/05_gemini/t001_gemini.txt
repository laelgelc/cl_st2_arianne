In 1970, Roger Payne (1935-2023) pioneered recordings of humpback whale songs, releasing a bestselling environmental album that deepened humanity's connection to nature. His work fueled the global anti-whaling movement, which included efforts by Greenpeace.

The recordings inspired activists like Rémi Parmentier, who distributed the record in France to support campaigns aboard the Rainbow Warrior. These efforts were part of the movement leading to the 1982 commercial whaling moratorium. Payne’s influence extended to other campaigns as well; Kelly Rigg recalls his testimony aiding in the efforts to protect North Atlantic right whales from offshore drilling.

Payne, who founded Ocean Alliance, consistently emphasized the importance of listening to the earth's voices.
