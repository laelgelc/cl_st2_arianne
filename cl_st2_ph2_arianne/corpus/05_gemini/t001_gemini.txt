In 1970, Roger Payne (1935-2023) recorded "Songs of the Humpback Whale," an album that would go on to sell over 100,000 copies. This recording was instrumental in inspiring the global anti-whaling movement, which included Greenpeace. Payne’s work, which included founding Ocean Alliance, helped secure the 1982 commercial whaling moratorium.

The album had a direct impact on our campaigns. Greenpeace activist Rémi Parmentier used Payne's recording, arranging its French release in 1978 specifically to promote the Rainbow Warrior's anti-whaling missions.

Kelly Rigg recalls Payne's supportive testimony against offshore oil drilling in 1982, highlighting his respect for young campaigners. Payne's practice of empathetic listening, both to whales and to humans, served to deepen humanity's connection to the natural world.
