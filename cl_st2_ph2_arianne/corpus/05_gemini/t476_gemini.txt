According to Vanessa Nakate, a Fridays for Future leader in Kampala, Uganda, climate disasters inflict a disproportionate level of harm on women within African communities. When floods destroy crops, the burden falls on women to restart food production and to walk long distances for survival. During droughts, water sources dry up, forcing women to carry heavy loads that cause back pain.

The consequences of these disasters are severe. Women, who are responsible for children, face homelessness and trauma. They are also exposed to increased risks of both physical and sexual violence. The loss of subsistence farming leads to devastating outcomes, such as forced early marriages for daughters. For pregnant women, the dangers are heightened, and they often lose their lives or their dreams.

Women are on the frontlines of climate action, and this vital role deserves respect. Advocating against climate change means speaking for the millions of women who bear the heaviest burdens of its impact.
