In South Africa's Mpumalanga Highveld, community activist Fana Isaac Sibanyoni advocates against the air pollution caused by coal-fired power plants, refineries like Sasol, and mining operations. The region, which is a declared pollution hotspot, experiences high levels of NO2 and SO2. These pollutants contribute to respiratory illnesses, cancer, strokes, and premature deaths among the population.

Sibanyoni, who is from the community of Embalenhle, engages with municipalities, companies, and local communities. His work aims to pressure authorities to improve air quality, using education and accountability to uphold the constitutional right to a clean environment.

Despite a 2022 court ruling that affirmed residents' rights to clean air, industries and the government often ignore these concerns.
