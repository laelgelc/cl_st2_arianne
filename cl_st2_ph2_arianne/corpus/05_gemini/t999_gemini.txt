In 1971, a group of activists sailed the boat "Greenpeace" to Amchitka Island to protest a US nuclear test. The voyage was funded by a rock concert featuring Joni Mitchell and James Taylor. The journey was beset by internal conflicts and ego clashes, and it was ultimately intercepted by the US Navy, failing to reach the site.

Despite not reaching its destination, the voyage sparked massive media attention. This led to the cancellation of further tests, and Amchitka was designated as a bird sanctuary. Bob Hunter recounted his initial despair over the "failure," but came to recognize it as the successful start of Greenpeace. The organization is now a global one with millions of members.
