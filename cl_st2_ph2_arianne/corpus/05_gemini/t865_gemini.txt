The impact of PFC pollution from DuPont facilities is felt by people like Jan and Ineke van Genderen in the Netherlands, who live near the Dordrecht plant and have elevated PFOA blood levels. In the US, residents Gwen and Earl Botkin have been affected by contamination of the Ohio River.

A class action lawsuit has exposed DuPont's cover-up of the health risks associated with PFOA. These risks are linked to diseases such as high cholesterol, cancers, and thyroid issues.

In response, Greenpeace is partnering with others for protests, hearings, and investigations. The danger continues, as PFOA is being replaced with other hazardous shorter-chain PFCs. Support is urged to combat these toxic chemicals.
