On the International Day of Rural Women, the Coordinadora Estatal Stop Ganadería Industrial in Spain is protesting against the harm industrial farming causes to people, animals, and the planet. This action challenges the stereotype of rural women as being inactive.

Women like Montse, Pilar, and Remedios highlight the role of the Coordinadora in uniting local groups. Their work aims to inform cities, coordinate efforts against large companies, and amplify rural voices. Remedios fought against a pig farm in her town. Pilar opposes harmful agricultural models and favors organic farming. Montse speaks out against the pollution of reservoirs.

Greenpeace Spain is joining this cause to highlight the organizing efforts of these women against industrial farming.
