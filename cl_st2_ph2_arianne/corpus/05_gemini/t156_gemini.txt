For over 50 years, Greenpeace has used art and creativity to inspire environmental action. This approach has been used to highlight critical issues including plastic pollution, deforestation, and climate change.

To protect rainforests from destruction for palm oil, murals have been created in Malaysia and in cities around the globe. In Brazil, a symbolic march was held to protest against mining. The importance of sustainable farming has been promoted through rice field art in Thailand. The sounds of the Papuan rainforest were even used to create a dance track.

The crisis of waste has been confronted through ads featuring African Trash Masks. In Taiwan, an aerial dance depicted marine animals suffocating on plastic, while a giant whale choked with plastic was featured at Italy's Viareggio Carnival.

To call for ocean protection, melting penguin ice sculptures have been placed in locations worldwide. To urge climate action, a melting version of the Vitruvian Man was created on Arctic ice.
