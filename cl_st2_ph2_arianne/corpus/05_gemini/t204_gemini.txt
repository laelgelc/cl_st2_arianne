For over 20 years, the Esperanza, whose name means ‘Hope,’ served as a beacon in our fleet. Originally a Russian fire-fighting vessel, she was renamed through an online vote, beginning a new chapter of her life with us.

On her decks, crews and activists confronted environmental crimes in remote locations, from the Antarctic to West Africa. They stood against pirate fishing and whaling, conducted vital studies, and bore witness. The Esperanza was more than a campaign vessel; she was also a vessel of aid. She delivered support during humanitarian disasters, including the 2010 Haiti earthquake and in the aftermath of Typhoon Bopha in 2012.

As the fastest, ice-class ship in our fleet, she truly symbolized hope. However, to align with the zero-carbon future we must all work towards, the Esperanza has been retired in Gijón, Spain. Despite receiving green upgrades over the years, her carbon footprint was a challenge we had to address. Though her service has ended, her spirit endures.
