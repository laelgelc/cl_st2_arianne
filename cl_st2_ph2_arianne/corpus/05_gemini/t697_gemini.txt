In the 20th century, commercial whaling, utilising explosive harpoons and factory ships, drove major whale species to the verge of extinction, echoing historical overhunting patterns seen with rhinos and elephants. The International Whaling Commission (IWC) was established in 1946 by whaling nations themselves as a response to declining catches. The IWC banned the hunting of blue whales in 1966 and, largely due to Greenpeace campaigns that successfully shifted public opinion, imposed a global moratorium on commercial whaling in 1982, which became effective in 1986.

This ban stands as a pivotal conservation victory, yet it remains under threat from existing loopholes and persistent pro-whaling efforts. Whales play a vital role in maintaining ocean health through carbon storage and nutrient recycling. Today, they face a new set of challenges, including climate change, pollution, entanglement, and plastics. It is imperative that the IWC prioritises these urgent issues over debates on whaling.
