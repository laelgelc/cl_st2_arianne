Greenpeace campaigner Alessandro Saccoccio recounts a nightmare about his son desiring a video game console for Black Friday, which stands in stark contrast to his own wish to provide his son with nature-based memories. He attributes this to consumerism, which is driven by advertisements and brands that create pressure for overconsumption.

This pressure is concentrated in cities, which are responsible for nearly three-quarters of global emissions. Our collective consumption habits currently require the resources of 1.8 Earths to sustain. The wealthiest 10% of the population are responsible for 36-45% of emissions, which pose a threat to nature and our food supplies.

There are solutions available. These include implementing carbon taxes that target the super-rich and phasing out the use of fossil fuels. Promoting low-carbon lifestyles is also key, which involves encouraging reuse, sharing, and prioritizing experiences over material objects. Saccoccio advocates for the regulation of advertisements and for teaching children that happiness is derived from doing, not from buying.
