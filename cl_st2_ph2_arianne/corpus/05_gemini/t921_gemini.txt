Thor S. Larsen, a pioneer in polar bear research, has been studying these magnificent animals since 1965. In that time, he has worked with over 2,000 bears and experienced magical moments, such as conducting maternity den surveys in the Arctic. As a member of the IUCN Polar Bear Specialist Group, he played a key role in initiating the 1973 Agreement on the Conservation of Polar Bears, a landmark treaty that banned most hunting while providing exceptions for indigenous communities.

Today, however, polar bears face grave threats. Their survival is jeopardised by retreating sea ice, which critically hinders their ability to hunt and to reproduce. The consequences are already visible, with declining numbers of dens in important areas like Kong Karls Land and Wrangel Island. Adding to this crisis is the persistent threat of pollution.

As a result of these pressures, many polar bear subpopulations are now declining. The situation requires urgent international action to address climate change and pollution. Furthermore, specific protections must be put in place for their essential denning areas.
