To avoid climate disaster and meet the Paris Agreement's 1.5°C goal, society must transform its food systems. Farming contributes one-quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions, making it a critical area for action. Specifically, livestock accounts for 14.5% of all emissions and is responsible for half of the world's methane emissions.

Despite this, the UN Food Systems Summit (UNFSS) has been criticized for its corporate dominance, which sidelines the essential voices of smallholder farmers and Indigenous Peoples. Instead of pursuing meaningful change, the summit has favored industry-led fixes like genetically modified chickens. This approach fails to address the core problem and ignores the solution outlined in a Greenpeace report: reducing meat and dairy production and consumption by 50% by 2050.

To create a sustainable future, we must amplify local voices and embrace ecological systems. It is crucial to resist the expansion of the livestock lobby, which drives deforestation, health crises, and inequity.
