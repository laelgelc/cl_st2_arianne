Greenpeace activists from 25 countries have protested Arctic oil drilling in Norway's Barents Sea. By entering the exclusion zone of Statoil’s Korpfjell well, they attached a globe containing global messages to the rig Songa Enabler, successfully halting its operations.

Following the action, the Norwegian Coast Guard arrested the activists, the crew, and the ship Arctic Sunrise.

This protest highlights that despite ratifying the Paris Agreement in 2016, Norway has granted new oil licenses and has begun drilling in its northernmost site.

In November, Greenpeace Nordic and Nature and Youth will challenge this in court in a case against Arctic Oil. People are being urged to add their witness statements to the more than 350,000 that have already been gathered.
