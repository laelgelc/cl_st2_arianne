The natural mist of the Amazon is a world away from the harmful smoke generated by deforestation-related fires, which has severe impacts on public health.

A 2020 report revealed the extent of the problem, noting that in 2019, pollution from these fires resulted in 2,195 hospitalizations for respiratory diseases. These hospitalizations, which peaked during the fire season, cost BRL 5.64 million. The smoke is known to exacerbate pre-existing conditions like asthma and has been linked to an increase in the severity of COVID-19, as observed in Rondônia.

Air quality in the region frequently exceeds the limits recommended by the World Health Organization, with children and the elderly being the most significantly affected. In addition to the direct threat to human health, the fires also contribute to climate emissions and cause a loss of biodiversity. Government action is urged to protect the forest, a critical step for safeguarding public health.
