Cristiane Mazzetti recounts a 21-day expedition on the Manicoré River in the Amazon, undertaken to support local communities engaged in a 16-year fight for their territorial rights and the protection of the forest.

Working alongside scientists from INPA, the expedition conducted biodiversity research, studying birds, mammals, botany, fish, reptiles, amphibians, and fossils. This collaboration fostered important exchanges between academic and traditional knowledge. Visits to local communities highlighted their sustainable practices, including the harvesting of andiroba oil, açaí, cocoa, and cassava through agroforestry systems.

A key achievement was the acquisition of the CDRU document, which grants the communities land use rights. This document is a significant aid in their efforts to create a Sustainable Development Reserve. Despite persistent threats from deforestation and land grabbing, the expedition succeeded in renewing hope amid the environmental challenges currently facing Brazil.
