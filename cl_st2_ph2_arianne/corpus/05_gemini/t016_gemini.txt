In a major victory for community protection and litigation, the municipality of Cayar has successfully banned the discharge of wastewater from a fishmeal factory. This follows decades of protests in Germany, which shut down its last nuclear reactor on April 15, 2023, a move that enables a faster transition to renewable energy.

Legal challenges are also proving effective. The EU Court of Justice ruled that permits for a coal plant in Bulgaria violated pollution laws. The pollution from the plant has been linked to thousands of deaths and resulted in billions in health-related costs. On a global scale, a historic Global Ocean Treaty has been secured. This agreement will pave the way for creating marine sanctuaries and is a critical step towards protecting 30% of the world's oceans by 2030.

The push for climate accountability continues, with the United Nations General Assembly, driven by students from the Pacific Islands, seeking an advisory opinion from the International Court of Justice on the duties of nations concerning climate change.

Action is also being taken against sources of pollution. Schiphol Airport announced it will ban private jets and night flights beginning in 2025. Finally, in a decision that bolsters free speech, a US court dismissed a logging company's SLAPP lawsuit that had been filed against Greenpeace.
