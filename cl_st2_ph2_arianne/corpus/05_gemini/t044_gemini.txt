My first sea action was aboard the Greenpeace ship Arctic Sunrise, where we protested Shell's "red monster" FPSO as it headed to extract oil from the Penguins field in the North Sea. I felt scared yet excited. I was angry at the greed of the fossil fuel industry and the inaction of governments that cause avertable disasters in places like Cameroon. I also worried about the climate impacts on future generations. Despite suffering from seasickness, I found elation in the global resistance. Communities, women, and youth are demanding an end to fossil fuels, accountability for loss and damage, and a just transition to clean energy.
