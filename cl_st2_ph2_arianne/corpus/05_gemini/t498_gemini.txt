Greenpeace UK has collaborated with Aardman Animations and actors including Olivia Colman and Helen Mirren to release the short film "Turtle Journey." The film depicts a turtle family’s struggle in a damaged ocean, a situation caused by human activities such as overfishing, oil drilling, plastic pollution, and climate breakdown.

The oceans play a crucial role in combating the climate crisis by absorbing emissions. However, marine species are being lost at a faster rate than land animals, and sea turtles face significant threats. To address this, there is a need to protect at least a third of the world's oceans. This can be achieved through UN-negotiated sanctuaries under a Global Ocean Treaty.

Viewers are urged to sign a petition and share the video. The goal is to pressure governments to take action for ocean protection.
