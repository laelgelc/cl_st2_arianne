On July 31, 2019, key Greenpeace leader Steve Sawyer passed away from lung cancer.

Beginning in 1988, he served as the Executive Director of Greenpeace International, a period during which he oversaw triumphs such as the protection of Antarctica from oil exploration, the Montreal Protocol on ozone-depleting gases, an end to the dumping of radioactive waste at sea, and early campaigns on climate change.

His early activism included missions on the Rainbow Warrior, such as the relocation of residents from the Rongelap atoll and protests against nuclear tests. He was a survivor of the 1985 French bombing of the vessel.

Later, Sawyer became the General Secretary of the Global Wind Energy Council, where he helped boost the global growth of wind power from 74GW to 539GW.

He is remembered for his courageous leadership and love of nature, as well as his personal passions for sailing and playing the blues guitar.
