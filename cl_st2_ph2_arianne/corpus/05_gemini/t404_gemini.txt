Our societal view of mobility, shaped by cars, oil, and marketing, champions individual freedom and status while ignoring the long-term consequences. This has led to pollution, streets that are unsafe for children, and significant climate damage.

There is a stark inequality at the heart of this system. Wealthier people are disproportionately responsible for emissions, but everyone suffers from the resulting air pollution, accidents, and environmental loss.

In the post-COVID world, we have an opportunity to push for systemic change toward a more resilient form of mobility. This future includes safe walking and cycling infrastructure, accessible public transport, and the use of electric cars for necessities, not for status-symbol SUVs. It prioritizes affordable trains over flights and the creation of more green spaces.

Mobility should be treated as a sustainable common good, one that prioritizes society, autonomy, and cohesion.
