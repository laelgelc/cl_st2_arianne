We are hosting the largest clothes swap party in Austria and Germany, with an expected 10,000 participants set to exchange 50,000 items across more than 40 cities. This event is part of our Detox campaign for clean textile production and promotes alternatives to the fast fashion industry.

Clothing consumption is doubling every decade. Cheaply made items are often discarded after only minimal use, ending up in landfills or being incinerated. Furthermore, the textile industry is a major polluter of freshwater, a problem particularly evident in China.

To counter this, we are highlighting better options such as reselling, repairing, and buying organic clothes. Alternatives like renting, sharing, and swapping are also key solutions. There are growing options for secondhand and eco-fashion, which can be found using an accessible interactive map.
