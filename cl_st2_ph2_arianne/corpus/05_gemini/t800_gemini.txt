Ten years ago, Greenpeace exposed how major brands were sourcing palm oil from companies that were destroying Indonesia's rainforests. This destruction endangered people, tigers, and orangutans. In response to public pressure, traders like Wilmar adopted No Deforestation, No Peat, No Exploitation (NDPE) policies in 2013, and most other traders followed suit by 2014.

However, recent investigations show that traders cannot prove their supply chains are free from deforestation. They maintain a 'don’t ask, don’t tell' approach. This has resulted in massive forest loss, declining orangutan populations, deadly haze from forest fires, and human rights abuses.

Brands such as PepsiCo and Unilever must disclose their sources and eliminate destructive suppliers from their supply chains. The discovery of a new species of Sumatran orangutan offers hope, but it also faces risks to its habitat.
