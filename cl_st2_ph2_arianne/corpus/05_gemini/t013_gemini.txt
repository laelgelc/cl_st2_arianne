We are facing a triple planetary crisis of pollution, climate change, and biodiversity loss. The human cost is undeniable, with threats ranging from war-related environmental harms to air pollution that kills 1,200 children in Europe every year.

On May 16-17, 2023, leaders will gather for the Reykjavik Summit. This is a critical moment for Council of Europe states to address a major gap in the European human rights framework. We urge them to formally recognize the human right to a clean, healthy, and sustainable environment.

The United Nations has already affirmed this right. By establishing a dedicated protocol to the European Convention on Human Rights, European nations can enhance protection for people and nature. This action would strengthen climate action, create greater legal certainty, and provide vital safeguards for environmental defenders.

Help us make this a reality. Please tweet your representatives and urge them to act. To stay informed, sign up for our campaign updates.
