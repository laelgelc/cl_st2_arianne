Europe is confronting a volatile energy crisis, driven by war, high prices, inflation, recession, and climate challenges. This situation risks pushing many into energy poverty this winter. An urgent reduction in the use of gas, oil, and electricity is necessary.

Industries must be prioritised through rationing and mandatory measures. The Netherlands has already shown a path forward with its 25% cut in gas consumption. Transport requires significant reforms, including the introduction of affordable public transport tickets and a ban on short-haul flights and private jets. Encouraging efficient driving is also crucial. Together, these transport measures can save oil, reduce emissions, and save €63 billion.

To make our homes more resilient, we must promote the adoption of heat pumps, insulation, and solar energy. To support those most in need, governments should tax the windfall profits of fossil fuel companies and use the revenue to aid vulnerable households.

Finally, we must end all fossil fuel subsidies and halt any new expansion of the industry. This is the only way to secure a just transition to a society powered entirely by 100% renewables.
