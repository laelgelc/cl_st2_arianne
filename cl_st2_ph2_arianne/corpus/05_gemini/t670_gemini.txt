Inspiring women are fighting to hold oil, gas, coal, and cement companies like ExxonMobil, BP, Chevron, and Shell accountable for climate change impacts. Their efforts are channeled through an inquiry by the Philippines' Commission on Human Rights, which was initiated by a petition in 2015.

Desiree Llanos Dee is a campaigner who connects carbon producers to the stories of affected communities, a mission inspired by the 2015 Rome-to-Paris Climate Walk. Supporting global efforts is Kristin Casper, a climate lawyer.

The testimonies of survivors are central to the inquiry. Marielle Bacason, who was traumatized by Super Typhoon Haiyan in 2013, has shared her story. Veronica “Derek” Cabe, who was impacted by Typhoon Ketsana in 2009, has also provided testimony. Through their experiences, they are emphasizing the need for climate and gender justice, seeking accountability for the sake of future generations.
