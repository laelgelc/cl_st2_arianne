Primark has become the 20th global clothing company to make a commitment to Detox, joining the movement to eliminate hazardous chemicals from our clothes and waterways. While this is a significant step, accountability is crucial. We must monitor the progress of all committed companies and remain vigilant in exposing any instances of greenwashing.

Recently, both Primark and Burberry have made commitments. Leaders in the industry like Mango and H&M are already advancing on their goals. In contrast, major brands such as Nike and Disney are lagging behind. It is time for other companies, including Disney and American Apparel, to take action and commit to Detox.

The path forward requires five clear steps for brands. They must first admit there is a problem with hazardous chemicals in manufacturing. Second, they must identify and replace harmful substances like NPEs. Third, companies must publicly disclose their chemical discharges. The final steps involve screening chemicals to create a blacklist of hazardous substances, which should be completed by 2019.
