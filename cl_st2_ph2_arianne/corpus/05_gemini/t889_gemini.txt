A report from iPES-Food outlines a roadmap for shifting from industrial agriculture to sustainable, ecological farming. The current industrial model, characterized by monocultures, relies on toxic pesticides, fertilizers, and antibiotics. This approach causes significant environmental damage, such as soil loss, pollution, and the decline of pollinators, which in turn threatens long-term food security.

In contrast, agroecological farming is a proven method used worldwide that works with nature. This approach enhances resilience, supports biodiversity, and increases farmer incomes.

The transition to this more sustainable system faces several barriers. These obstacles include corporate lobbying by pesticide and feed companies, privatized research that favors industry interests, and widespread misconceptions that industrial methods are necessary to feed the world. The report urges governments, businesses, producers, and consumers to collaborate to overcome these challenges and implement change.
