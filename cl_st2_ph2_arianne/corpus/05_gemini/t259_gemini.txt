Thirty years ago, governments banned oil drilling and mining in Antarctica. This victory, achieved through the 1991 Madrid Protocol, was influenced by Greenpeace's campaigns and the establishment of a base that allowed us to join negotiations. The key lessons from this were the importance of respecting planetary boundaries and collaborating for protection.

Today, Antarctica faces new threats from climate change, pollution, and destructive fishing, which are causing penguin populations to decline. It is crucial that the Antarctic Ocean Commission prioritizes the creation of ocean sanctuaries to protect marine life.

A strong Global Ocean Treaty at the UN could create a network of protected areas, help combat biodiversity loss, and ensure benefits are shared with coastal communities. Nearly four million people are now urging action to safeguard 30% of the world's oceans by 2030.
