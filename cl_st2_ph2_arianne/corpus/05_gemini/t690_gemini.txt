Around the world, environmental defenders are met with criminalization, threats, surveillance, and violence from both governments and corporations. Movements are labeled as terrorism and targeted with lawsuits.

The number of killings is rising. According to Global Witness, the death toll rose from 154 in 2015, to 201 in 2016, and 207 in 2017. In 2018, 66 more defenders were killed.

Berta Cáceres was murdered in 2016 for her work opposing the Agua Zarca dam in Honduras, a project that threatened ecosystems and the rights of the Lenca Indigenous people. An investigation implicated officials from the DESA company in the planning of her assassination.

This week, the trial of the eight people accused in her murder begins. This is a chance to end impunity. It is a moment to demand justice for all defenders and for the planet.
