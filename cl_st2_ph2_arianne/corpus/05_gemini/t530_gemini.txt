Greenpeace photographer Jurnasyanto Sukarno is documenting Indonesia's forest fire crisis, which is caused by the clearing of peatlands for palm oil plantations and results in toxic smoke. At the "Oxygen House" in Palangkaraya's Doris Sylvanus Hospital, he witnessed a family seeking help for their 50-day-old baby, Rafa, who was struggling with smoke inhalation. Amid emotional distress, the infant received oxygen and steam therapy.

Sukarno reflects on the plight of children who do not have protective masks and sees families making repeated visits to hospitals. He notes that the crisis is the worst it has been since 2015. During this time, the government has not revoked any palm oil licenses, and no sanctions have been placed on the companies responsible.
