In the search for hope amid ecological crises, we find that logic and our big institutions offer little. Governments and corporations, bound by global capitalism and pre-ecological politics, are failing to address the reality of overshoot.

Instead, hope is found by looking away from these structures and toward other sources. It lies in the long timescales of nature, in wildness, and in the humility this inspires. It is found in the work of simple, local communities dedicated to restoring their own habitats. It lives in the artists who can inspire change and in the quiet perseverance of modest people.

Drawing on the spirit of figures like Rachel Carson, Wendell Berry, and Leonard Cohen, this path requires patience and persistence, like that of spawning salmon fighting their way upstream. It is a call to turn away from hubristic management and return to a more grounded, indigenous, and place-based way of living.
