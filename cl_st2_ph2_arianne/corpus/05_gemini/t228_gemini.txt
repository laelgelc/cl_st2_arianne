From 1974 to 1982, I documented our campaigns as a Greenpeace photographer. I recall chartering ships to confront whaling fleets at sea. Between 1975 and 1976, we directly disrupted Russian whalers, and the footage from our whale confrontations went on to have a global media impact. My work also took me to abandoned whaling stations, capturing memories of the past.

We also took action to halt the harp seal hunts off the coast of Labrador. During this campaign, we worked to find a compromise with local and Indigenous hunters.

Our efforts included anti-nuclear actions, where we worked with allies like Allen Ginsberg to blockade sites such as Rocky Flats and Seabrook. In 1981, we also carried out a "test blockade" of an oil tanker. These are some of the photographs and memories from those years on the front lines.
