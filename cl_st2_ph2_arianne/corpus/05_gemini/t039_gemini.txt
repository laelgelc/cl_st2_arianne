The IPCC's Sixth Assessment Report confirms that human-caused climate change is intensifying weather extremes around the world. These events have widespread impacts on ecosystems and vulnerable communities. It is these communities, who have contributed the least to the crisis, that suffer the most.

The report shows that risks are escalating at lower warming levels than previously thought. On our current trajectory, we are heading toward 3°C of warming by 2100, which threatens irreversible losses like the melting of ice sheets and the extinction of species.

However, limiting warming to 1.5°C is still possible. This requires urgent action. We must halve emissions by 2030, rapidly phase out fossil fuels, and shift to renewable energy. It also requires ecosystem restoration and equitable finance. A sustainable future is only achievable through transformative, inclusive changes across all sectors.
