The deep sea contains vast genetic resources. These include viruses and the anti-viral mechanisms found in creatures like sea cucumbers, which inspired the development of CRISPR technology. This technology, used for treating diseases, earned its creators a Nobel Prize in 2020.

Preserving these deep-sea ecosystems is more profitable than mining them. The marine biotechnology sector is projected to reach a value of USD 5.4 billion by 2027, far exceeding the USD 7 billion forecast for deep-sea mining.

However, deep-sea mining will destroy these habitats. We are calling on governments and the UN to protect this "Common Heritage of Humankind." It is essential that we safeguard these environments for future medical advances rather than sacrificing them for short-term profits.
