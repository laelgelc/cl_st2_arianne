In the face of the coronavirus crisis, we must urge the redirection of public funds. Money should be moved away from planet-destroying industries and toward public health, planetary well-being, and a just transition to a harmonious future by 2030.

We must be on guard against the "shock doctrine" that exploits workers. It is a time to call for accountability from leaders, emphasizing community, cooperation, and compassion over blame or division.

The choices we make should protect the vulnerable. They should help us learn deep lessons and foster an open, egalitarian, and peaceful world. Even amid personal challenges, we are seeing acts of courage. We must remain vigilant. Crises like this make the impossible possible.
