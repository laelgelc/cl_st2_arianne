In the Vital Ocean Voices series, Mauritian scientist and fisherman's daughter Aurelie Hector shares her story, highlighting the impacts of destructive fishing, pollution, and climate breakdown on Indian Ocean communities.

Raised like a boy, she went fishing with her father, where she witnessed declining catches resulting from larger fleets and marine depletion. Her connection to the ocean inspired her to become a conservation biologist. After graduating with a BSc in Biology, she worked at the Mauritian Wildlife Foundation. As the Senior Warden on Round Island, she protected seabirds from invasive species and monitored ecosystems. Her work also involved removing fishing debris and cleaning plastic pollution from coastal areas.
