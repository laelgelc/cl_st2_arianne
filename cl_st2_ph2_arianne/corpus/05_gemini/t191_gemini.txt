Our oceans play a critical role in climate mitigation, absorbing 90% of the planet's excess heat and nearly one-third of all methane and CO2 emissions. They are responsible for producing between 50% and 80% of the oxygen in our atmosphere, with marine phytoplankton like Prochlorococcus generating more oxygen than all the world's tropical forests combined.

However, human activities are impairing these essential functions. Overfishing, plastic pollution, and offshore oil and gas extraction are damaging the oceans' ability to regulate our climate. This disruption is leading to altered ocean currents, increased flood damages, and is projected to double the frequency of El Niño events by the end of the century.

Greenpeace demands urgent action. We are calling for a Global Ocean Treaty to protect at least 30% of our oceans by 2030. This must be accompanied by bans on commercial whaling and the extraction of fossil fuels from the seabed. We also demand an end to illegal fishing and the contamination of our marine ecosystems.

To investigate the threats facing our oceans, our ship, the Arctic Sunrise, is currently in the Argentine Sea. The movement for ocean protection is growing, with nearly five million people having already signed a petition demanding action.
