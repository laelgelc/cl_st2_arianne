Illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing is a billion-dollar industry with a dark side linked to murder, slavery, corruption, and deception. The sheer scale of this shadow economy is staggering, with an estimated 8 to 14 million metric tons of illegal fish, worth between $9 and $17 billion, caught annually. In 2019 alone, U.S. imports of these products were valued at $2.4 billion.

The fight against this illicit trade is relentless, exemplified by Sea Shepherd's 110-day chase of a notorious poaching vessel. However, the human cost of this industry is immense. The documentary "Murder at Sea" explores the perilous role of fishery observers, who risk their lives to monitor and report on these illegal activities.

Beyond the dangers faced by observers, the industry is rife with severe human rights abuses, including modern slavery. These harrowing conditions are depicted in films such as "Buoyancy" and "Ghost Fleet." The latter documentary features the work of activist Patima Tungpuchayakula, highlighting her efforts to rescue individuals trapped within this brutal trade.
