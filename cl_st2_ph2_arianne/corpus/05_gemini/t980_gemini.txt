Greenpeace celebrates G-Star's commitment to eliminate hazardous chemicals from its supply chain and products by 2020. This makes G-Star the 15th global corporation to join the Detox movement, alongside other brands like Uniqlo, Benetton, and Victoria’s Secret.

This new commitment is a significant improvement on G-Star's previous half-hearted pledge. It includes concrete elimination dates, a commitment to transparency, and forthcoming case studies on how to substitute toxic substances. The fashion industry has long polluted waterways with hazardous chemicals, and some brands have only offered loophole-filled greenwashing commitments in response.

Public pressure has successfully turned former greenwashers like G-Star and Levi’s into Detox leaders. To continue this momentum, Greenpeace urges people to share the "Detox Fashion" video to demand more action from brands that have not yet committed, such as GAP and Calvin Klein.
