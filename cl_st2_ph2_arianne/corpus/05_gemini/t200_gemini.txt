Industrial fishing fleets targeting squid are decimating marine wildlife, including sharks, rays, and dolphins. This activity harms coastal communities and sustainable fishers in areas such as the Indian Ocean.

A report from Greenpeace reveals that the squid industry's rapid growth is a threat to global ecosystems. In the North-West Indian Ocean, the number of vessels has increased by over 800% in five years. In the South-West Atlantic, armadas of over 500 vessels have been observed.

This unchecked industrialization is happening in international waters, which lack regulation. A strong Global Ocean Treaty is urgently needed to regulate these fisheries, create ocean sanctuaries, and protect the oceans. This protection is essential for our climate, ecosystems, food security, and the livelihoods that depend on a healthy ocean.

Nearly five million people have signed a petition urging action on this issue.
