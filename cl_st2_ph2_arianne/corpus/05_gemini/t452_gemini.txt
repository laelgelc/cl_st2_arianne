On World Tuna Day, we celebrate the remarkable beauty and size of tuna. However, this celebration is set against the backdrop of harmful industrial fishing practices. These include illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing and overfishing, which threaten tuna populations. This industry is also responsible for the bycatch of other species, like turtles and sharks.

Beyond the environmental toll, there is a human cost. Migrant workers on distant water fishing vessels face exploitation, enduring poor conditions and having their wages withheld.

There is a better path forward. We must support small-scale, ethical fisheries. Governments can foster this change through investments that boost local economies, promote ocean health, protect worker rights, and strengthen food security, which has been challenged by COVID-19 disruptions. A just transition to sustainable fishing methods will allow fish populations to recover and ensure our supply chains are resilient for the future.
