This January, the World Economic Forum's Davos meeting is virtual because of COVID, with the in-person gathering shifted to Singapore in May, a move that highlights geopolitical changes. During the crisis, billionaires like Jeff Bezos have profited immensely, which has fueled calls for a green and just recovery to address both inequality and climate change.

Greenpeace supports radical policies worldwide to achieve this, including a Wealth Tax in Canada and a New Normal in the Philippines. In France, we back dividend bans for companies that are inactive on climate, and we support green recovery proposals in India, the US, Spain, and New Zealand.

Global polls demonstrate strong public support for such transformational change. In line with this, Greenpeace is backing campaigns like Make Amazon Pay and advocating for a #PeoplesVaccine. We urge people to join #BetterThanDavos actions to demand the systemic reforms that are needed, instead of the minor fixes proposed by the World Economic Forum.
