To combat the climate emergency, Greenpeace campaigns worldwide against the oil industry.

In Australia, efforts are underway to defend the Great Australian Bight from Equinor's drilling. In Brazil and French Guiana, the Amazon Reef is being protected from BP. Across Europe, Germany is seeing protests against internal combustion engines, while Norway is legally challenging Arctic drilling and the UK is blocking BP rigs.

In Russia, we support Indigenous opposition to the oil company Surgutneftegas. In Canada, we are fighting tar sands pipelines, and in New Zealand, we oppose OMV's drilling permits. In the Philippines, activists are blockading Shell and there are investigations into the accountability of fossil fuel companies. In the US, there is a push for a Green New Deal and a halt to fossil fuel expansions.

From continent to continent, millions of people are uniting for a transition to clean energy.
