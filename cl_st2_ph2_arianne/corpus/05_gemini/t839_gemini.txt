Fast fashion, driven by companies like H&M and Zara, has doubled global clothing production to a staggering 100 billion garments annually. This has resulted in clothes having shorter wear times, contributing to massive landfill waste. The cycle of overconsumption is fueled by low prices and the fulfillment of emotional needs.

There is a significant environmental benefit to changing our habits. By doubling the lifespan of our clothes from one to two years, we can cut carbon emissions by 24%. This change also saves precious resources, including water and fossil fuels.

We must rethink our relationship with clothes to break this addiction and rediscover true fashion. You can join the Fashion Revolution by participating in events centered on sewing, upcycling, and repairs. Consider taking part in clothing swaps and embracing secondhand shopping. Resources are available, including Haulternatives, challenges, and maps to guide you. It's also an opportunity to share clothing love stories and celebrate the items we already own.
