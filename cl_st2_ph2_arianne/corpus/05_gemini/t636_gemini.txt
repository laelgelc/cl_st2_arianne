In Russia, forests covering an area twice the size of Spain are under threat. These forests, which account for 10% of the country's total, grow on land legally designated for agriculture. Under Russian law, these forests are considered "illegal," and landowners are required to clear them or face penalties. This policy often leads to unrestrained logging or burning, releasing CO2.

The areas in question include old forests that have existed since Soviet times, as well as new forests that have grown on abandoned lands. In response to this situation, a campaign by Greenpeace Russia has prompted changes to the federal Forest Code. The amendments have begun the process of legally recognizing these forests, although this recognition is only partial so far.

Regulating these 100 million hectares of forest offers a significant opportunity. It could enhance biodiversity, enable further tree planting, and establish a major carbon sink. Russian forests are vital for the global climate and biodiversity. To urge further reforms, over 50,000 people have signed a petition addressed to President Putin. The implementation details for the recent legal changes are still pending.
