Our recent expedition to the Antarctic set out to observe incredible wildlife, including penguins and whales. However, what we uncovered was evidence of widespread pollution reaching even this remote region.

Our team discovered microplastics in water samples and hazardous chemicals in the snow. The presence of these chemicals in freshly fallen snow indicates just how pervasive this contamination is. In addition to microscopic pollutants, we also found and removed visible fishing waste, such as discarded buoys and nets.

These findings highlight the critical need to address plastic pollution at its source. The solution requires reducing plastic production and ending the use of single-use plastics.

Governments have a chance to take decisive action. A proposal is on the table to create an Antarctic Ocean Sanctuary, a protected area five times the size of Germany. This sanctuary, which has the backing of 1.6 million people, would help protect marine life from these pressures.
