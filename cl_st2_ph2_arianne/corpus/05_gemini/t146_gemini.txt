In Chile, the Greenpeace Roots project collaborated with local communities, MODATIMA Women, and Finland's Sibelius Music Academy to create "Canto del Agua," a collective song protesting water privatization. The workshop was held in La Ligua, a region experiencing a severe water crisis attributed to looting, not just drought.

During the workshop, musicians and activists shared their experiences of family devastation, migration, and territorial destruction. The creative process involved activities such as sound collection, rhythmic improvisation, and co-creation. This collaborative effort culminated in a concert held on the World Day to Combat Desertification and Drought. Following the performance, "Canto del Agua" was recorded for digital promotion, with the aim of it becoming an anthem for the de-privatization of water.
