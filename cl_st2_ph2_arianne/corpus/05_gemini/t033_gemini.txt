The climate crisis is inseparable from gender inequality and human rights. To ensure women can participate in climate decision-making, it is essential to prioritize girls' education.

The fossil fuel industry, a patriarchal system, creates significant economic disadvantages for women, including pay gaps. Women are also disproportionately affected by rising energy costs and pollution. These factors worsen their vulnerability to both gender-based violence and the impacts of extreme weather events.

Activists have pointed out that women are more supportive of renewable energy than men. To address these interconnected issues, intersectional approaches are crucial. Such strategies are essential to mitigate the effects of the climate crisis on women and to empower them in leadership roles.
