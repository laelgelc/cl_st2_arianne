We have released a video to urge LEGO to end its partnership with Shell. The film shows a LEGO-built Arctic suffering an imagined oil spill. This is a reflection of a real-world threat, as Shell's actual Arctic drilling plans risk devastating the ecosystem.

The film was created with the agency Don’t Panic and includes cameos from the LEGO Movie, Game of Thrones, and Santa Claus. Our goal is to pressure LEGO through widespread sharing of the video.

LEGO’s choice of partners is being questioned. The company's environmental goals for children clash with Shell's activities, which include pollution and threats to the Arctic. We are calling for LEGO to ditch Shell in order to protect the Arctic and kids.
