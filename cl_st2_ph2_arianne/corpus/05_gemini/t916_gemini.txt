To celebrate the International Day of Forests on March 21, we can all contribute by reducing our meat consumption. Around the globe, people-powered movements are fighting threats to our forests.

In Tasmania, ancient forests are being destroyed by climate-driven fires. A proposed mega-dam threatens the Amazon's Tapajós River and the Munduruku Indigenous People who live there. In China, illegal logging is a threat to giant pandas, prompting the creation of protective strategies. A victory was won in Argentina, where proposed oil drilling in Calilegua National Park was canceled. There are also active calls to maintain a logging moratorium in the Congo Basin. Meanwhile, Indonesia continues to face deforestation for palm oil. In Canada, a major success has seen the protection of 85% of the Great Bear Rainforest. Finally, there are demands to stop cattle ranching in the Amazon, which is linked to deforestation.

With 80% of the world's forests already degraded, these fights are critical. We invite you to share your own celebrations of forests.
