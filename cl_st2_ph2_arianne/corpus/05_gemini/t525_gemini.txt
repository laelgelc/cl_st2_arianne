Urgent action is needed to protect our oceans. Scientists have stressed that we must protect at least a third of the world’s oceans by 2030 to help marine life recover and to combat climate breakdown.

The UK has made a commitment to designate 30% of its waters as marine protected areas by 2030 and has formed the Global Ocean Alliance. However, to enable the creation of effective ocean sanctuaries worldwide, we need a strong Global Ocean Treaty. The UN negotiations to achieve this have been slow.

This week, on 23-24 October, Norway is hosting the 'Our Ocean' conference in Oslo. This event is being criticised as mere PR, failing to offer real solutions. We must push leaders to move beyond empty promises. People are being urged to tweet to demand meaningful action.
