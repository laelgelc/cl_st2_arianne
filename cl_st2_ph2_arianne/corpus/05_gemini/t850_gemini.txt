Since 2007, 7.1 billion smartphones have been produced, using a complex mix of over 60 different elements. The mining and processing of these materials have significant environmental and social impacts. The energy consumed in the manufacturing of these devices has reached 968 TWh, an amount equivalent to the annual energy supply of India.

This production has led to a massive e-waste problem. In 2014, smartphones contributed to 3 million metric tons of e-waste, yet only 16% of this was recycled. The design of the devices contributes to this issue, as most models lack easily replaceable batteries. This design choice results in short device lifespans, which are about two years in the US.

Recycling is often inefficient, and the recall of the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 highlights the scale of the waste. A shift to a circular model is necessary. We must call on companies like Samsung to improve the repairability of their devices and commit to better recycling. Petitions are being organized to urge them to take these steps.
