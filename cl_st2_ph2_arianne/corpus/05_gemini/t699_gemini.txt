Upcoming UN negotiations on a Global Ocean Treaty represent a historic moment, a last chance for the oceans. The goal is to ensure that protection is prioritized over business interests on the high seas, the vast stretches of water that cover two-thirds of our planet’s oceans and are currently unprotected.

Oceans are vital for all life on Earth. They provide a habitat for marine life, a source of food for people, and the oxygen we breathe. However, they face immense threats from industrial fishing, plastic pollution, the prospect of seafloor mining, and climate change. Currently, only 1% of the high seas is protected.

This treaty is critical because it would enable Member States to create a network of ocean sanctuaries. The target is to protect at least 30% of the world's oceans by 2030. Greenpeace will be in New York to advocate for a strong treaty, pushing for the creation of off-limits sanctuaries that will allow marine life, including whales and corals, the space they need to recover.
