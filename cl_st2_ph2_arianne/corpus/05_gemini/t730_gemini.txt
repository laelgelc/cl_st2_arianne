A journey into the Sungai Putri forest in Ketapang, Indonesia, reveals the risks of peatland drainage caused by canal building. The logging company PT MPK is constructing these canals, a violation of government sanctions from 2017. This activity drains the peatlands, causing them to dry out and elevating the risk of forest fires, reminiscent of the 2015 tragedy.

This drainage also has a direct impact on local communities, affecting their rice paddies and water management. Furthermore, the forest is a crucial habitat for diverse wildlife. It supports a population of 900-1,200 orangutans who are threatened by this habitat loss. A visit to a rehabilitation center for these animals underscores the very real dangers of extinction.

The situation emphasizes how vital forests are for both human and animal life, and it calls for action from communities and the government to ensure their protection.
