Shell has a plan to abandon parts of four old oil rigs in the North Sea's Brent Oil Field. Three of these structures contain over 11,000 tonnes of oil, which will eventually pollute the sea. This action sets a toxic precedent.

On October 14th and 15th, Greenpeace activists conducted peaceful protests on two of the platforms. They hung banners with a clear demand: Shell must clean up its mess and stop polluting our oceans.

In response to this, Shell is seeking an order from an Edinburgh court to indefinitely ban protests near its platforms. Shell is taking this step because it fears public pressure and the possibility that the government might reconsider the company's plans.

On November 28th, Greenpeace will be in a Scottish court to defend the right to peaceful protest. We are calling for public support to amplify our voice.
