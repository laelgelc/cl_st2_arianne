The Indonesian government's narrative blames Borneo's devastating floods on heavy rainfall, but the real cause is the widespread deforestation from palm oil plantations and mining concessions, enabled by lax environmental policies.

The new Omnibus Law only worsens the situation by removing critical environmental protections, including the requirement to maintain at least 30% forest cover. This policy facilitates corporate exploitation and significantly increases our vulnerability to natural disasters.

As a campaigner, I have been part of this fight for a long time. We have challenged these destructive practices before, even winning a lawsuit in 2015. Now, facing the dual challenges of the climate crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic, we must unite once more. We need to come together to protect Borneo's precious biodiversity, accelerate the shift to renewable energy, and prioritize the health of our planet above all else.
