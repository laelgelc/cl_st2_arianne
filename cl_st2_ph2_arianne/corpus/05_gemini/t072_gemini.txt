The first session of UN negotiations for a Global Plastics Treaty, known as INC-1, concluded in Uruguay on December 2, 2022. These initial talks focused on procedural matters, set against a backdrop of calls for binding rules to address the impacts of plastic pollution on human rights, biodiversity, and the climate.

Greenpeace attended the negotiations to advocate for a strong treaty. We are pushing for an agreement that covers the full lifecycle of plastic, from production to disposal. This must include global control measures to cut plastic production and eliminate false solutions like chemical recycling.

There were some positive developments. A sense of regional urgency was noted, and coalitions were formed to push for a just transition. The inclusion of human rights objectives was also a positive step. However, progress was hindered by industry lobbying and procedural delays.

The next negotiating session is likely to be held in Paris in May 2023.
