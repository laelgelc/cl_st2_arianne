A recent UN FAO report claims that meat, eggs, and milk provide essential nutrients that are difficult to obtain from plant-based foods, making them vital for health, particularly for vulnerable groups. This messaging aligns with that of the meat industry.

The report was reviewed by livestock organizations such as the Global Dairy Platform and the International Meat Secretariat. Furthermore, some of the report's authors are linked to the pro-meat Dublin Declaration, which raises concerns about the report's objectivity.

This position contrasts with evidence from the EAT-Lancet commission and other nutrition bodies, which show that well-planned plant-based diets can meet nutritional needs. The tactics employed by the meat industry are comparable to those used by the fossil fuel industry to downplay climate impacts.
