A recent report from the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) makes the claim that meat, eggs, and milk provide essential nutrients that are difficult to obtain from foods that are plant-based. The report argues these animal products are vital for health, particularly for vulnerable groups.

However, this conclusion aligns with the messaging promoted by the meat industry. The report’s objectivity is a concern, as it was influenced by livestock organizations, including the Global Dairy Platform and signatories of the pro-meat Dublin Declaration.

This stance contrasts with existing evidence from bodies like EAT-Lancet and other nutrition organizations, which support the healthfulness of well-planned plant-based diets.

The tactics of the meat industry can be compared to those of the fossil fuel sector, especially in their efforts to downplay the negative climate and health impacts associated with their products.
