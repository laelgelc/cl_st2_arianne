The battle against illegal logging continues. While there has been progress, persistent issues like corruption in producing countries undermine these efforts. In the Congo Basin, for instance, forests are being cleared for agriculture, creating a supply of suspect "conversion timber" for importers, including the European Union.

Our own report, "Trading in Chaos," exposes the chaotic state of the sector in the Democratic Republic of Congo. It details how companies like Cotrefor not only export illegal wood but also neglect their contractual obligations to local communities. This is reinforced by Global Witness's "Blood Timber" report, which revealed firms funding rebels through the trade of conflict timber destined for markets in the EU and China.

Despite reforms, research from Chatham House indicates that the illegal trade has remained stagnant. China is identified as the top importer and processor of this timber, with markets also growing in India, South Korea, and Vietnam. The enforcement of laws such as the EUTR and FLEGT is therefore crucial. Protecting communities, preserving biodiversity, and saving our forests depends on it.
