The Paris Agreement’s goal to limit global warming to 1.5°C demands radical changes across all industries. While progress is being made in the electricity sector, where renewables now supply over 20% of power in the EU, the transport sector is falling behind. Emissions from transport are actually rising, a trend fuelled by increasing car sales, especially of SUVs.

A study commissioned by Greenpeace and conducted by German researchers shows that the adoption of electric vehicles alone will not be sufficient to meet climate targets. The research predicts that to stay within the transport sector's carbon budget, a ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars must be implemented in Europe by 2028.

Norway serves as an example of how rapid change is possible, having used incentives to achieve fast growth in electric vehicle adoption with the aim for all new cars sold to be zero-emission by 2025. However, a sustainable transport system requires broader solutions, such as investing in bike lanes, ensuring affordable public transport, and encouraging car sharing.
