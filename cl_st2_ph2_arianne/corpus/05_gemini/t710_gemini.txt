In 2013, the 'Arctic 30', a group composed of 28 Greenpeace activists and two journalists, were jailed for two months in Russia. Their imprisonment followed a protest against Gazprom's Arctic oil rig, which they conducted from the Dutch-flagged ship, the Arctic Sunrise. The vessel was seized in international waters.

After being released on bail and receiving amnesty, the Arctic 30 filed a case with the European Court of Human Rights in March 2014. Their claim alleges that they were subjected to unlawful detention and that their freedom of expression was violated.

Although the Netherlands won a related case in 2017, the issue of the individual rights of the Arctic 30 remains unresolved. On 12 July 2018, the group submitted further arguments to the court, a move supported by the NGOs ARTICLE 19 and the Media Legal Defence Initiative. As part of this submission, they have requested a hearing. A date for a decision has not yet been set.
