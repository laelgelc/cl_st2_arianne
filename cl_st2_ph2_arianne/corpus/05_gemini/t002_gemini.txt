After witnessing floods in Kogi state caused by waste and climate change, three young Nigerian women developed a new tool for environmental action. Angel Chukwudi-Denis, Fortune Mmesomachukwu, and Favour Chinecherem, known collectively as Eco Elixirs, created the EarthExp app.

The app uses games, VR, and social features to promote behavioral change. It educates users on critical environmental impacts such as plastic pollution and deforestation. Inside the app, users build cities and are challenged to make eco-friendly decisions. They can earn rewards for taking positive actions, including planting trees.

This project amplifies youth activism within Nigeria, supporting efforts focused on issues like waste reuse and anti-gas flaring. Ultimately, the EarthExp app works to inspire mindset shifts needed to build a sustainable future.
