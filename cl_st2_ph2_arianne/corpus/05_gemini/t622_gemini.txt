An EU inquiry is now facing ExxonMobil in Brussels over its role in climate change denial, an action prompted by a petition from Food & Water Europe.

The company has known about the links between fossil fuels and the climate since 1957. Despite this knowledge, it spent millions of dollars deceiving the public and delaying action on the issue, a course of action that has cost governments decades.

Even though Exxon now acknowledges the risks, its current business plans risk exceeding the limits of the Paris Agreement.

When called to a European Parliament hearing on climate denial, the company refused to attend, which now risks it being banned from lobbying. This is not the first time Exxon has avoided scrutiny; it has previously avoided inquiries in the Philippines and has also faced lawsuits in the US.

It is time to hold Exxon accountable. We urge you to tweet your questions to the company.
