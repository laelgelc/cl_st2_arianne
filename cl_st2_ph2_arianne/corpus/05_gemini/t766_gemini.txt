In Coast Salish territory near Vancouver, Canada, ten activists peacefully blocked a Kinder Morgan construction site. The group, which included Greenpeace founder Rex Weyler and the children of founders Dorothy and Irving Stowe, acted to delay a tar sands oil pipeline.

They took this action in solidarity with Indigenous communities to preserve ecological integrity. The pipeline violates Indigenous rights, threatens air and water, and contributes to climate change.

The group was arrested, joining a series of resistance actions against the project. These actions include a recent march that drew over 10,000 people. You can sign on to oppose Kinder Morgan and tar sands pipelines.
