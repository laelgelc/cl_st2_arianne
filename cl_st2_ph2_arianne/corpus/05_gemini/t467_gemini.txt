We are living through a time of interconnected crises. The COVID-19 health and economic emergencies are deepening the chronic climate crisis that already endangers our collective future. In this moment, we must prevent investments from flowing into destructive industries.

We must remain vigilant against the exploitation of this situation through the 'shock doctrine.' Instead of bailing out polluters, public funds must be directed toward public health, the well-being of our planet, and a just transition to a harmonious and equitable future. We must hold our leaders accountable and advocate for cooperative investments that are aligned with nature.

Our response must be rooted in compassion, courage, and community. We can combat the virus without resorting to blame or division. This is a time to learn lessons that will allow us to protect the vulnerable, to build new alliances, and to prioritize the care of our families and ourselves. Crises have a way of making the impossible possible—it is up to us to ensure that change is for the better, not for the worse.
