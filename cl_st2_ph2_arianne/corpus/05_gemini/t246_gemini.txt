With 55% of the global population living in cities, a figure set to rise to 68% by 2050, our urban centres are responsible for 70% of emissions. This makes cities crucial in addressing the climate crisis.

Urban areas face significant vulnerabilities, including pollution, inequality, and heatwaves, all of which are exacerbated by climate change. Projections indicate rising temperatures and longer heatwaves for European cities. It is vital that mayors and citizens prioritize both planetary and human health by taking resilient actions. These actions include improving public transport, creating more bike lanes, ensuring access to local food, and developing green spaces.

Implementing green policies could save up to $17 trillion by 2050. On World Cities Day, we demand immediate government action to build sustainable and resilient urban futures for everyone.
