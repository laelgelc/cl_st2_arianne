As part of European Mobility Week, the #MobilityForAll campaign is sharing interviews with underrepresented communities about their mobility experiences in European cities.

One mother from Romania described the challenges she faced navigating her city with a baby and a stroller. She spoke of buildings with no ramps, high sidewalks with potholes, and cars parked on the sidewalks, blocking her way. She also found buses to be inaccessible and pedestrian paths unsafe.

She envisioned a city with child-friendly infrastructure, complete with ramps, smooth sidewalks, and safe walkways for everyone. Frustrated that her demands for such changes were met with inaction, she eventually moved to the countryside.

Her experience highlights the need for change. The campaign demands car-free city centers, improved public transport, and access to shared mobility. We are also calling for better cycling and walking infrastructure and the creation of more green spaces. We urge people to join the conversation and share their own stories using the hashtag #MobilityForAll.
