This Pride month, Greenpeace celebrates by waving its rainbow emblem of hope and diversity to honor its LGBTQ+ crews and supporters. The post also highlights the queer diversity found among ocean creatures. It is noted that human concepts like sexuality apply loosely to animals, a world where prejudice is absent.

Examples of this diversity in marine life include young male orcas that engage in male-on-male sex and bisexual seahorses, where the males are the ones to give birth. Female albatrosses form pairs to raise their young together. Some species are hermaphroditic, like starfish and sea urchins. Other animals can change their sex; wrasses can change from female to male, while clownfish can shift from male to female.

This diversity emphasizes a shared complexity with marine wildlife, and it shows there is much more to discover.
