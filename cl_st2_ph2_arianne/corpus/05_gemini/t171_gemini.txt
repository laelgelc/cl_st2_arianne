A global movement for clean air is expanding. Air pollution is causing serious health issues like asthma, heart disease, and stroke, and there is no safe level of exposure.

During World Health Day week, from April 7-10, citizens around the world protested under the banner of #CleanAirNOW. They demanded localized solutions, including dedicated bus lanes, upgraded PM2.5 standards, and stronger regulations on transboundary haze.

The World Health Organization (WHO) recently strengthened its air quality guidelines. However, according to IQAir’s 2021 report, 97% of cities failed to meet them, and this is happening amidst data shortages.

To address both the air pollution and climate crises, governments must adopt clean energy and equitable mobility solutions like public transport, walking, and cycling.
