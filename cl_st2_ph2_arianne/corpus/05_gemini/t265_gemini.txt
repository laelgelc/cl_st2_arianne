During a visit to Brindisi's beaches on the Adriatic coast, extensive plastic waste was observed. A bleach bottle from the 1960s, made by Montecatini, was found, highlighting how plastic persists in nature for decades.

The local petrochemical plant, now under the ownership of ENI's Versalis, manufactures plastic pellets using oil and gas. This facility is a source of pollution, contributing to gas flaring and benzene emissions. The demand for plastic is driven by large brands such as Coca-Cola and Nestlé, which connects the plastic crisis to the climate emergency and enables the fossil fuel industry.

Local people have reported health concerns and feel disillusioned by the plant's unfulfilled economic promises. Greenpeace provides support to affected communities in their efforts to transition to a green economy.
