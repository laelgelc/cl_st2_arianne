Ahead of its Annual General Meeting, Greenpeace Switzerland activists projected messages onto Nestlé’s headquarters in Vevey. The projections accused the company of fueling the plastic and climate crises through its reliance on single-use packaging.

Activists demanded that Nestlé reduce its throwaway plastics and make significant investments in reusable systems. They criticized the company’s focus on recycling and alternative materials as a form of greenwashing that is harmful to biodiversity.

In 2020, Nestlé sold 1.3 million tonnes of single-use plastic, while less than 1% of its packaging was reusable. The company has also been named one of the world's top global polluters.

The projected messages highlighted that plastic is derived from petroleum and urged for a fundamental shift from single-use packaging to reuse systems in order to combat both plastic pollution and global warming.
