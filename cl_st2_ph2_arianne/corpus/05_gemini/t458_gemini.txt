A new documentary, "The Story of Plastic," features global activists who are fighting plastic pollution. The film follows the story from Houston to Jakarta and Delhi.

The documentary critiques industry narratives that place blame on consumers and countries in Asia. Instead, it highlights plastic's origins in fossil fuels and the production emissions that occur in places like Houston. The film exposes the waste crises unfolding in Southeast Asia and makes a clear connection between the plastic lifecycle and climate change. It also shows the health impacts on marginalized communities and urges the need for systemic change.

You can watch "The Story of Plastic" when it is broadcast on the Discovery Channel on Earth Day, April 22. A digital pre-premiere will be available on DiscoveryGo starting April 15. The film will also be accessible through video-on-demand rentals. To host virtual community screenings, you can visit storyofplastic.org.
