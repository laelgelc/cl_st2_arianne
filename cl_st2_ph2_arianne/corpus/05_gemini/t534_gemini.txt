Hurricane Lorenzo rapidly intensified to a Category 5 storm in the northeastern Atlantic, an unprecedented event for the region. It stands as the strongest hurricane ever observed so far east and one of the most northern on record. Now classified as a post-tropical cyclone, it is heading toward the British Isles.

This powerful storm is part of a larger pattern, following a trend of increasing Category 5 hurricanes observed between 2016 and 2019. Hurricanes are rotating wind systems that form over warm tropical waters. While global warming may not necessarily increase the total number of these storms, it can cause them to intensify more quickly, carry more rainfall, and move more slowly.

To combat the growing threat of such extreme weather, it is essential that we accelerate our efforts to reach zero emissions by 2040.
