Japan is set to discharge over 1.2 million tons of contaminated wastewater from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant into the Pacific Ocean, starting in 2023. This action is being pursued despite global agreements, such as the London Convention and Protocol, which prohibit the dumping of nuclear waste at sea.

This current plan stands in stark contrast to Japan's position in 1993. At that time, influenced by Greenpeace campaigns, Japan actively opposed Russia's dumping of nuclear waste. It supported a global ban on the practice and went as far as to fund the construction of Russian liquid radioactive waste treatment facilities.

At a recent International Maritime Organization meeting, Greenpeace proposed alternatives to the discharge, including long-term storage and the use of advanced processing technology. However, Japan, with support from the United States, France, and the United Kingdom, successfully blocked these discussions. Other nations, including South Korea and Pacific island nations, favored a review of the plan.

Japan's current stance, which has the support of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), is being criticized for disregarding its legal obligations and the significant concerns of its regional neighbors.
