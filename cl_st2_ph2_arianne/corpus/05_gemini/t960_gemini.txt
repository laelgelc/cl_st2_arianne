Amid rapid environmental changes, there is an urgent need for increased funding for Antarctic scientific research and conservation. However, it is important to scrutinize the sources of such funding.

Aker Biomarine, a major krill fishing company, has announced a new research fund, a move that can be seen as potential greenwashing. Krill is a keystone species, essential to the Southern Ocean ecosystem as a food source for whales, penguins, seals, and other wildlife.

There are concerns over the harvesting of krill for use in supplements and animal feed. This practice is unsustainable, especially in the face of climate change and ocean acidification. A Greenpeace paper has previously opposed the certification of Aker's fishery.
