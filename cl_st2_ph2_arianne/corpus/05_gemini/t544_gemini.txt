Hollywood and the industry promote an unsustainable, car-centric vision of future transport. Instead, we should advocate for efficient public systems like trains, buses, and trams, which reduce energy use and serve as a social safety net. Successful networks can be seen in cities such as Moscow, Beijing, and Auckland.

Reducing the number of cars is essential to improve air quality and reclaim space. Los Angeles, with its vast parking areas, exemplifies the amount of urban land dedicated to vehicles. For essential needs that remain, shared electric vehicles are a proposed solution. This should be implemented alongside the promotion of walking and cycling, with London and Copenhagen serving as examples.

A protest in Frankfurt has already taken place against the car industry's climate impact. A call for action is now being made via an open letter.
