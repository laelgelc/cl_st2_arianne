On the UN International Day for the Total Elimination of Nuclear Weapons, we confront the reality of these instruments of indiscriminate harm. The devastation of Hiroshima is a lasting reminder of their impact. While biological and chemical weapons are prohibited, nuclear weapons remain a glaring exception.

The 1970 Non-Proliferation Treaty remains unfulfilled, and the risks of proliferation persist. Despite reduced arsenals, expenditures on nuclear weapons are rising, even though they are obsolete against modern threats. These funds should be redirected to address actual human security needs.

A clear path toward elimination now exists. In 2017, the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons was adopted by 122 states. It is set to enter into force in 2020, upon reaching 50 ratifications. The treaty currently has 60 signatures and 15 ratifications. Although nuclear-armed states are boycotting this effort, they face growing global pressure. The implementation of this treaty is essential to ban nuclear weapons and end their proliferation for good.
