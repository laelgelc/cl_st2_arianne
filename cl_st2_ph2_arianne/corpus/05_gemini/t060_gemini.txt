In Brazil's largest Indigenous territory, the Yanomami Land bordering Venezuela, 20,000 Indigenous people are facing an invasion by 20,000 illegal miners. This invasion is causing widespread environmental destruction, river pollution, and a severe humanitarian crisis.

The use of mercury by miners is poisoning food sources and water, leading to severe health issues and deaths among the Yanomami. In addition to chemical contamination, the miners spread diseases such as malaria, with 11,530 cases recorded in 2022. Malnutrition is also rampant, especially among children.

Under the previous Bolsonaro government, illegal mining in the territory surged by 1,963% between 2019 and 2021. In 2022, a 150-kilometer illegal road was observed, facilitating further damage.

The new government under President Lula has created a Ministry of Indigenous Peoples, led by Sônia Guajajara. This move signals a commitment to establishing systemic protections for the rights of Indigenous peoples and all inhabitants of the Amazon.
