The Dvinsky Forest, one of Russia's last Intact Forest Landscapes in Europe, provides a home for eagle-owls, wolverines, brown bears, and other rare species. This forest, however, is facing destruction from logging.

Certification schemes such as the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) and the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC) are failing to protect it. These schemes provide companies with market access while they continue to source materials from intact forest areas. The FSC's Motion 65, intended to protect these landscapes, is at risk, and the PEFC lacks support for such protection.

A Greenpeace campaign in 2001 led to agreements that halted logging in the forest's core. Now, companies including Arkhangelsk Pulp & Paper Mill, ICE Titan, Solombalales, and Region-Les are pressuring authorities to resume logging activities. Without formal protection, the Dvinsky Forest could be erased in a decade.

As a vital part of the Great Northern Forest, its preservation is important for biodiversity and the climate. Greenpeace urges loggers, authorities, and the FSC to take action to safeguard this forest.
