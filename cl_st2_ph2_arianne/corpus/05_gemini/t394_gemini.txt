As world leaders and senior politicians convene virtually at the UN Summit on Biodiversity to address our nature and climate emergencies, they are being met with a clear message. Young climate and nature activists have issued a Wake Up Call, reminding them that words alone are insufficient.

These young activists are demanding real action to protect people and the planet. A video of their demands is available.

To help governments move from words to action, guidance is available on the ambitious steps they can take to protect our oceans. We invite Environmental ministers or members of UN delegations to join discussions on these emergencies by emailing veronica.frank@greenpeace.org.
