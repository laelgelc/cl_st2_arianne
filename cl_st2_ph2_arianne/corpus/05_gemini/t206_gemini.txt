The dumping of plastic waste from Western countries onto African and other global majority nations constitutes "waste colonialism." This practice perpetuates exploitation similar to historical colonialism, impoverishing communities and creating health issues. A UN report has highlighted the disproportionate impacts on marginalized people of color. This modern form of exploitation exists alongside other ongoing colonial-like practices, such as France's "colonial tax" and illegal fishing.

After China banned waste imports, the flow of plastic waste was redirected to countries including Senegal and Kenya. This dumping distracts from the pursuit of genuinely sustainable solutions. To end this injustice, a strong global plastic treaty is needed. Such a treaty must establish binding rules, mandate a reduction in single-use plastics, and enforce accountable waste management.
