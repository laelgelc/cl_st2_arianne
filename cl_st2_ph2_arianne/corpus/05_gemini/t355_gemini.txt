Earth's biodiversity is collapsing, a crisis on a scale comparable to the mass extinctions of the past. This devastation is driven by human pressures. The very fabric of life that provides our food, clean air, and water is unravelling. Nature regulates our climate and the flow of essential nutrients, protects us from the spread of diseases, nourishes our spirits, and provides the foundation for medical advances.

This destruction is fueled by a system of extractive capitalism. Destructive industries, like fossil fuels and industrial farming, continue their damaging practices while governments prioritize corporate profits over real, lasting solutions.

To turn the tide, we must fundamentally rethink our systems of production and consumption. We must demand the protection of at least 30% of our planet's lands and oceans by 2030, a goal that must be achieved through genuine partnerships with Indigenous communities. This requires ambitious global agreements, such as those discussed at CBD COP15, to restore the balance and resilience our world desperately needs.
