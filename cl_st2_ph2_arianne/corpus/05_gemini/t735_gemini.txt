While insurance companies warn us about the risks of climate change, they are simultaneously insuring and funding the fossil fuel projects that drive it. Insurers have invested over $600 billion in fossil fuel companies.

Insurance is a critical enabler for the coal industry; without it, many projects could not go ahead. This support makes possible the 1,500 new coal plants that are currently planned, which would expand global coal capacity by 42.7%.

However, progress is being made. Sixteen insurers have now divested $22 billion from coal. Leading firms such as AXA, Zurich, Allianz, and Swiss Re have stopped providing coverage for new coal ventures.

Through the Unfriend Coal network, Greenpeace is demanding that insurers divest from coal companies, stop underwriting new coal projects, and shift their investments to renewable energy. By exposing the laggards in the insurance industry, we can drive the change needed to protect our climate.
