In 2000, while on a seafloor mapping expedition aboard the ship Atlantis, Professor Gretchen Früh-Green made a discovery entirely by chance. At a depth of 800 meters, she found the Lost City hydrothermal vent field. She recounts an awe-inspiring scene of white, cathedral-like structures, geysers, and colorful life.

This unique site in the Atlantic sustains itself for thousands of years and may hold insights into the formation of Earth and the very origins of life. Feeling protective of this special place, Professor Früh-Green warns of the threat posed by unregulated deep-sea mining. She is concerned about the potential impacts of dust, noise, and unknown chemicals from this activity.

She urges for a Global Ocean Treaty to safeguard vulnerable ocean wonders like the Lost City from such destructive industries.
