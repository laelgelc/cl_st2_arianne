In the Vital Ocean Voices series, we learn the story of Kylian, a 7-year-old from Mauritius. He was influenced by his family's background in fishing and conservation. After visiting the Ile Aux Aigrettes nature reserve, he learned about the interconnectedness of wildlife, the ocean, and local livelihoods.

When the Wakashio ship ran aground, it spilled 1,000 tonnes of oil, harming marine life. In response, Kylian took action by cutting his cherished long hair and donating it to be used in oil-absorbing barriers. He also created a motivational YouTube video, joined a protest, and wrote a story. His aim is to inspire others, especially children, to protect the oceans.
