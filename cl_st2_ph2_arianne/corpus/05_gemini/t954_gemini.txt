The broken industrial food system is chemical-intensive, with significant impacts on people, farmers, the planet, and animals.

The scale of the problem is immense. In 2007, 269 tonnes of pesticides were used globally every hour. At the same time, one-third of all food produced is wasted, which is an amount that could feed 149 million people in Europe every year. The system is also resource-heavy; it takes 403,000 liters of water to support just one person's annual consumption of meat and dairy.

An alternative exists in ecological farming, which prioritizes people, health, and biodiversity, integrating science with local knowledge. Individuals can help drive this change. Actions like buying ecological, local, and seasonal food, shopping at farmers' markets, and eating less meat contribute to a people-powered movement. This movement can influence markets and governments to shift their support towards ecological farming.
