Hope is a vital natural resource that fuels environmental activism. For over 50 years, Greenpeace has seen victories, from halting nuclear tests and commercial whaling to more recent legal wins against Shell.

Amid climate crises like fires and floods that can cause despair, there has been recent progress. In 2023, the Global Ocean Treaty was established to create marine sanctuaries. Negotiations for a Global Plastics Treaty are ongoing, and lawsuits against Greenpeace have been dismissed. Indigenous resistance continues to delay fossil fuel projects.

The International Energy Agency (IEA) has outlined pathways to stay within the 1.5°C target by using renewables. Solar and wind energy are now cheaper, and there are financial shifts away from fossil fuels. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has confirmed that there is still time to reduce emissions. It is through collective action that we can preserve hope and drive the systemic change needed.
