While images of turtles and whales affected by plastic pollution are common, the severe impact on humans is often overlooked. Plastic is a product of the fossil fuel industry, which lobbies to sustain single-use plastics while falsely promoting recycling as a solution.

Research from Greenpeace East Asia and GAIA shows that after China banned imported waste in 2018, plastic flooded into Southeast Asia. This has resulted in high waste piles, poisoned crops, and toxic emissions from open burning that affect vulnerable communities. Even in the nations that export waste, it accumulates in low-income areas, creating health risks.

Corporations like Nestlé and Unilever profit from maintaining this status quo. The only way to truly address the plastic pollution crisis is to halt production.
