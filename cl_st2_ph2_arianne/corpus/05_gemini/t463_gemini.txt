During the COVID-19 pandemic, we can take actions to remain safe, healthy, and eco-friendly.

For proper mask usage, it is important to select the right size and wash your hands before putting it on. The mask should fit snugly over your nose, mouth, and chin. While wearing it, you should avoid touching it. To prevent pollution, it is essential to dispose of masks responsibly.

Adopting a plant-based diet can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions, according to IPCC data. Recipe suggestions are available to help make this change.

To stay healthy at home, it is beneficial to remain active through activities like cooking, exercise, gardening, or stretching. It is also important to practice physical distancing. We should also take the time to show gratitude to frontline workers and practice self-care.

Additional tips for staying safe include implementing home zoning to prevent virus spread and maintaining good hygiene in pet care. The benefits of mask-wearing are a key part of protecting ourselves and our communities.
