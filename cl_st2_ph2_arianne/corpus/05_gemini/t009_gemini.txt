The "Citizen Climate" series highlights global citizens acting for a healthier planet. In it, Kenyan photojournalist and activist James Wakibia discusses the financial challenges activists encounter, noting his reliance on personal funds and failed grants, which has led to scaled-down activities.

Wakibia calls for support for climate-impacted communities in Kenya, such as those affected by floods at Lake Nakuru, as well as those dealing with job losses and droughts. He advocates for adaptation through methods like climate-smart agriculture and increased public awareness.

He also campaigns against plastic pollution in rivers by educating his 24,000 Twitter followers, participating in clean-up efforts which he sees as temporary, and pushing for a ban on single-use plastics. Wakibia urges for a strong Global Plastics Treaty to be established in Paris to curb fossil fuel-based production and the resulting pollution that harms environments, animals, air, and food.

He notes that youth bring connectivity, energy, creativity, and technology to the movement, using these skills to mobilize for awareness and policy change.
