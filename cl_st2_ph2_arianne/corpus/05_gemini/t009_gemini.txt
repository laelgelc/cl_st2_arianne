Our "Citizen Climate" series highlights global citizens acting for a healthier planet. In this feature, Kenyan photojournalist and activist James Wakibia discusses the challenges of activism. He points to funding shortages, a reliance on personal finances, and failed grant applications, which have led to his efforts being scaled down.

Wakibia calls for supporting climate-impacted communities in Kenya. He mentions those affected by floods at Lake Nakuru, as well as communities facing job losses and droughts. He advocates for adaptation measures such as climate-smart agriculture and increased public awareness.

Wakibia also campaigns against plastic pollution in rivers. He educates his 24,000 followers on Twitter, pushes for bans on single-use plastics, and supports a strong Global Plastics Treaty in Paris. He believes such a treaty should reduce fossil fuel-based production to help achieve a plastic-free future.

He emphasizes that raising awareness is crucial for achieving policy change and highlights the role of youth in mobilizing with their energy, creativity, and technology.
