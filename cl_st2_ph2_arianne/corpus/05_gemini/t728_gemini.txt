Delhi's air pollution is worsening, with personal anecdotes noting how smog ruins winters and impacts health. This contrasts with actions taken in China and London, which were driven by public anger. In India, public outrage remains seasonal, which hinders progress.

Air pollution is a silent killer. An LSU study has proposed 13 measures that could cut pollution by 40% and prevent 900,000 premature deaths annually. These measures could also reduce winter PM2.5 levels by 50-60% in North India, with a particular focus on curbing emissions from coal plants. The study's proposals align with recommendations that have been made to the Ministry.

While India is in the process of finalizing a National Clean Air Programme, its implementation will require shifts in mindset and people-led movements. The issue of air pollution was overshadowed by Prime Minister Modi's 2022 ban on single-use plastics. Unlike in China, the seasonal nature of public outrage in India is a barrier to progress.
