Following the 2011 TEPCO nuclear disaster, Mr. Toru Anzai, a 73-year-old from Iitate, Fukushima, was evacuated from his home. The trauma he experienced from witnessing the destruction and loss made him initially unable to photograph the events.

In 2012, his perspective changed after meeting the photojournalist Kikujiro Fukushima. This encounter inspired him to resume photography. He has since captured approximately 40,000 photos and videos documenting the post-disaster townscapes, the evacuated areas, and the recovery efforts. His work has been displayed in exhibitions in Tokyo, Fukushima, and Yamaguchi.

The disaster's long-term impact became personal in 2018 when Mr. Anzai had to demolish his own dilapidated home. Today, he lives in the town of Date, situated near the restricted zones. He continues to document Fukushima's "now," driven by a desire to preserve these records for future generations, despite facing ongoing challenges.
