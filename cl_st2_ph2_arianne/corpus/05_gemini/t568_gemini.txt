Greenpeace is embarking on an expedition aboard the ship Esperanza to the Sargasso Sea. This unique ecosystem, located in the Bermuda Triangle, is known for its clear waters and endemic life. It is now threatened by plastic pollution which gets trapped there by ocean gyres.

Plastics in the ocean harm wildlife, including turtles, whales, and fish, and are entering the food chain. To aid in the ocean's recovery, we are proposing the creation of ocean sanctuaries under a new Global Ocean Treaty. These protected areas would shield ecosystems from stresses such as overfishing, vessel traffic, and deep-sea mining. Providing this protection is akin to allowing someone to rest when they are ill so they can recover. We urge you to sign the petition and to pressure corporations to end single-use plastics.
