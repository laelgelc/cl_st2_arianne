During Women’s Month, Luchelle Feukeng dreams of a green Africa, envisioning a future where climate action empowers women.

In her vision for South Africa, renewable energy brings an end to load shedding, which enables female students to study safely. She imagines a Cameroon where women have access to clean forests and rivers, and its capital, Yaoundé, is free of plastic bottles, leading to better health. For the Democratic Republic of Congo, she sees the cancellation of oil block sales protecting the forests, an event celebrated by Indigenous People.

This dream extends across the continent. In Senegal, women regain their fish supplies from the oceans, ensuring nutrition for their families. In Kenya, an amended seed law allows farmers to share uncertified seeds, sparking celebrations nationwide.

Luchelle Feukeng hopes to advocate for this reality.
