In Gothenburg, delegates from 15 European countries are attending an OSPAR meeting to discuss the establishment of a Marine Protected Area in the Arctic. The proposed area, located in the international waters north of Greenland, would be pie-shaped and comparable in size to the UK.

This area is vital for ice-dependent species like polar bears, walruses, and harp seals, especially amid rapid Arctic warming and sea ice melt. Projections suggest the region could see ice-free summers by 2030. Currently, less than 1.5% of the Arctic Ocean is protected, with no protected areas in its international waters.

Norway, Iceland, and Denmark have previously resisted the proposal, citing technical issues. However, the proposal has since been improved. To urge the delegates to act, Greenpeace is hosting an exhibition in Gothenburg. Backed by over seven million supporters, we are calling on the delegates to finalize protection for this area for future generations. We invite people to sign a declaration in support.
