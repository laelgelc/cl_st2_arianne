Our oceans are facing a crisis. Each year, eight million tonnes of plastic enter the marine environment, turning our oceans into a "plastic soup."

Disposable plastics do not go away. Instead, they persist, breaking down into smaller and smaller microplastics. These tiny particles enter our food chains and have been found in fish and even sea salt. At the same time, larger pieces of plastic are killing marine life. Seabirds, fish, turtles, and whales die from ingesting plastic or becoming entangled in it.

We can all be part of the solution by remembering to "Reduce, Reuse, Recycle." There are five key actions you can take. First, refuse single-use plastics such as bags and straws. Second, avoid buying cosmetics that contain microbeads. Third, make sure to buy and recycle plastics, and if recycling facilities are not available in your area, advocate for them. Fourth, you can participate in beach cleans. Finally, encourage others to join you in taking these steps.
