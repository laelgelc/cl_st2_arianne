In May, Greenpeace International hosted a live conversation on extractivism in Latin America and the power of community resistance. The event, part of the Collective Climate Action project, featured speakers Rosario Coll and Sophie Schroder.

The session was part of a Roundtable Discussion series moderated by journalist Stefanía Dommarco. The panel included Gustavo Huici, Riccardo Tiddi, Juan Sarmiento Lobo, Lorena Donaire, and Alejandra Jiménez Ramírez, who shared their direct experiences combating deep sea oil exploration, deforestation, mining, fracking, and issues of water access.

The discussion highlighted Latin America's position as a key environmental battleground. It showed how these fights are intertwined with struggles for sovereignty, equity, and human rights, underlining the importance of global movement alliances amid the ongoing climate crisis.
