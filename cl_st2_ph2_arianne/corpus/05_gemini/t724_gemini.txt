At the University of Minnesota, Dr. Nate Hagens' course "Reality 101" uses systems ecology, neuroscience, and economics to explore the major predicaments facing humanity, including economic decline, inequality, pollution, biodiversity loss, and war.

In addressing the question of "What can I do?", the course advocates for non-linear approaches. It emphasizes a set of guiding principles, such as building community cohesion, preserving ecosystems, and promoting local energy and food systems. It also calls for accepting complexity, loving nature, and focusing on self-improvement, a concept referred to as "sharpen the sword."

The key priorities identified are reducing consumption, stabilizing the population, cutting energy demand, and ending militarism. To achieve these, a range of actions are suggested, including engaging in campaigns, starting local initiatives, pursuing education, and sharing resources. For those seeking to learn more, book recommendations are provided for deeper understanding.
