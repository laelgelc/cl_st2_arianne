The climate crises of 2021, from heat waves to floods, have signaled a "code red for humanity." While these events disproportionately affect developing nations, they are now impacting all of us. To address this, ending corporate greed is vital. We must redirect the resources of the super-rich from destructive activities toward climate solutions, which can be achieved through measures like taxing excessive wealth.

Key strategies include banning advertisements for fossil fuels, supporting Indigenous resistance, and accelerating the transition to renewables. A group of 183,000 ultra-wealthy individuals wields an outsized influence, and taxing them can enable the systemic change we need.

It has been 50 years since the publication of "The Limits to Growth," yet our society remains unsustainable amidst rising inequality. The inequalities exposed by the COVID-19 pandemic serve as a preview of the climate disparities to come. For this reason, Greenpeace is allying with the Fight Inequality Alliance to prioritize the well-being of our planet over private profit.
