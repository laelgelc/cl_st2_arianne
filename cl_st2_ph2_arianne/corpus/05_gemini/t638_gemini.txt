Off the coast of Brazil lies the unique Amazon Reef, a diverse ecosystem supporting species like the pink dolphin. Thousands of miles away, Australia's Great Southern Reef is home to leafy sea dragons, whales, and sea lions. Despite their distance, these two incredible marine environments share a common threat: oil companies.

Near the Amazon Reef, the oil company Total had its drilling license denied. Similarly, in the Great Australian Bight, Equinor's plans have been delayed due to strong community opposition and the significant environmental risks posed by potential oil spills.

Greenpeace campaigns are working to protect these vital ecosystems. These efforts bring together global defenders, dedicated scientists, and local communities who are standing up to protect their homes from the fossil fuel industry. We are advocating for a transition to clean energy. We urge you to join the movement to defend these precious reefs.
