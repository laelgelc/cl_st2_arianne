Quack Pirihi, an Aotearoa activist with Ngāpuhi, Ngāti Wai, Ngati Porou, and Ngāti Whatua o Kaipara heritage, is attending the ISA conference in Jamaica. She travelled with Pacific activists aboard Greenpeace’s Arctic Sunrise to address the stakes Indigenous peoples have in deep sea mining.

Pirihi emphasizes the cultural connections to both land and ocean. She warns that deep sea mining exacerbates the impacts of colonization, such as incarceration, mental illness, and systemic failures. These impacts, she states, hinder the processes of healing and liberation for her people.

Guided by her ancestors, Pirihi advocates for solidarity, maintaining a presence in international spaces, and employing playful protest. She notes that when outsiders fail to observe proper protocols like karakia and karanga, they undermine mana and intrude. While Papatūānuku has the ability to cleanse, mining poses a threat to livelihoods and to Māori identity, which is intrinsically tied to the moana.
