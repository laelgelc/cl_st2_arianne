Amid rising extreme weather, the urgency of climate change demands action over inaction. A key player in this is Samsung Electronics, which continues to rely on dirty energy like coal. Despite its massive scale—producing 400 million smartphones in 2016, supplying major companies like Apple and Tesla, and earning $10 billion in profit—only 1% of the energy used in its production comes from renewables.

While rivals like Apple have already switched to 100% renewables, Samsung lags far behind. It is time for Samsung to live up to its slogans and make the choice for renewable energy.

My name is Insung Lee, and at Greenpeace, we are rallying people to pressure Samsung. Together, we can demand that the company stops fueling climate change.
