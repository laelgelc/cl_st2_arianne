In our Vital Ocean Voices series, we profile 25-year-old Athina Antoine, a member of the Reef Rescuers team with Nature Seychelles. Her work takes place on the Cousin Island Special Reserve, where she is actively restoring coral reefs.

The team's daily efforts follow the reef gardening method. This process begins with collecting fragments of *Pocillopora* coral, which are then broken into smaller pieces known as nubbins. These nubbins are attached to ropes and placed in midwater nurseries. Here, the team monitors their growth and regularly cleans away biofouling. After nine to twelve months in the nursery, the corals are transplanted back onto the reef.

This restoration is a direct response to the impacts of coral bleaching caused by ocean warming and pollution. For Seychelles, healthy reefs are critical, supporting the nation's fisheries and tourism industries while also providing essential ecosystem services. Through her work, Athina hopes to inspire more youth to become involved in ocean conservation.
