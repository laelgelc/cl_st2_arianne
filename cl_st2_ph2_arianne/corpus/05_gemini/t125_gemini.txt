The Amazon rainforest is under severe threat from intentional fires and deforestation. These actions are primarily driven by land grabbers, illegal loggers, miners, and cattle ranchers. Since 2019, these groups have been emboldened by Bolsonaro's anti-environment policies.

As a result, deforestation has spiked. In the last 40 years, 17% of the forest has been lost, pushing it near a critical tipping point. If this point is reached, the Amazon could be transformed into a savanna, which would be devastating for biodiversity, Indigenous communities, and the global climate. Key drivers behind this destruction include agribusiness and meat production.

There are solutions. We must enforce existing laws, designate more protected areas, and formally recognize Indigenous lands. It is also crucial to end deforestation within supply chains. To achieve this, it is important to support the guardians of the forest, such as Indigenous Peoples, and organizations like Greenpeace.
