The year 2016 brought environmental and social setbacks. We witnessed power grabs by politicians and corporations, and the murder of activists. There were forest fires, reef bleaching, and ice melt.

For 2017, we can make resolutions to build a sustainable world. We can improve our skills in campaigning and mobilizing others, and also take time to recharge personally. To reduce our personal impact, we can eat less meat, avoid plastics, choose to walk or cycle, and repair items instead of replacing them.

It is urged that we stand with Indigenous Peoples, workers, and stand against injustice. We can use our voices to contact officials and companies. We must demand forest protection and climate accountability. We can also volunteer locally and involve our friends and family in these actions.
