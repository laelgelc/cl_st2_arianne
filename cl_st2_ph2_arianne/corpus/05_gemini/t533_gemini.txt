Young activists Andreas Magnusson and Ell Ottosson Jarl from Fridays for Future recently discussed their climate activism with Greenpeace founder Rex Weyler. They shared that their entry into the movement was sparked by experiences with nature, research on extinctions, and anti-war sentiments.

When talking about what sustains them amid feelings of overwhelm, they pointed to their global friendships, anger at injustice, community support, and the importance of staying active. The young activists also highlighted positive signs they have observed, such as increased media attention and the prevalence of greenwashing.

Weyler offered his own advice on building international connections within movements. He suggested managing egos, meditating, and studying leaders like Gandhi as methods to foster resilience and unity.
