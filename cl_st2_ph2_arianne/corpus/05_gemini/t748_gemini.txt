For centuries, the Munduruku Indigenous People have inhabited the Tapajós River area in the Brazilian Amazon. Over 12,000 people rely on this river for their food, transportation, and cultural practices.

For three decades, they have fought to protect their land from threats. Last year, with the help of Greenpeace and global support, the São Luiz do Tapajós dam project was halted. However, 40 more dams are still planned for the area. The dams would flood vast areas, harming biodiversity and communities.

To secure official recognition of their land, the Munduruku spent two years creating a "Map of Life," which depicts their interdependence with nature. This week, they traveled to Brasília and joined 3,000 other Indigenous People to demand territorial protection. They delivered their map to the Ministry of Justice.

In a show of solidarity, over 1.2 million people have signed petitions supporting their cause.
