In response to Nestlé's statement on reducing single-use plastics, which followed a petition signed by over 3 million people, Greenpeace is issuing its critique.

Nestlé has pledged to cut its use of single-use plastics and introduce reusable packaging options, such as containers for Häagen-Dazs ice cream and dispensers for NESCAFÉ, MILO, and water. The company also stated an aim for 100% of its packaging to be recyclable or reusable by 2025.

However, Greenpeace criticizes the plan for its lack of transparency regarding the company's total plastic production volumes. The scale of the proposed reusable initiatives is considered insufficient. Furthermore, the statement reveals an overreliance on recycling, a process that is only 9% effective. Critically, Nestlé's announcement does not include plans to reduce its overall volume of single-use packaging.

Greenpeace is urging the company to commit to genuine reductions in order to achieve a waste-free future.
