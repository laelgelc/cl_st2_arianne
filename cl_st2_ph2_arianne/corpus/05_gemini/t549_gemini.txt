The car industry is engaging in greenwashing, pretending to care about the environment, health, and safety. In reality, the sector contributed 9% of global greenhouse gas emissions in 2018, which is more than the total emissions of the European Union.

We are calling for the phasing out of diesel, petrol, and hybrid cars, with an end to all new sales by 2028. The industry must shift to producing smaller, lighter, and more efficient electric vehicles. In line with the Paris Agreement, a rapid transition to public transport, renewables, cycling, walking, and micro-mobility is necessary.

An open letter is targeting companies such as Volkswagen and Hyundai-Kia for exploiting loopholes, cheating regulations, and prioritizing high-emission SUVs. To challenge these practices, protests are planned at the Frankfurt Motor Show on September 14.
