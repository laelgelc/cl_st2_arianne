After nearly two decades of negotiations, a historic Global Ocean Treaty has been agreed upon at the United Nations. This is a major conservation victory where nature has been prioritized over geopolitics.

The treaty provides a framework for protecting 30% of the world's oceans by 2030 through the creation of global sanctuaries. These protected areas are essential for combating climate change, ensuring food security for billions of people, and supporting livelihoods around the world.

This achievement was made possible by a wide range of contributors. Key players included civil society, governments such as the Small Island States, the G77, the EU, the US, the UK, and China. Furthermore, the voices of over 5.5 million people who signed petitions were a vital part of this success.

While the treaty now moves on to technical editing, translation, and eventual adoption, and more work is needed to implement it, this moment highlights the incredible power of collective action.
