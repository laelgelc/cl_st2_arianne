Forest fires are raging across more than five million hectares in Siberia, and less than 90% of them are being managed. A Greenpeace Russia team has been on the ground in the Krasnoyarsk region to document the catastrophe.

Our team has interviewed local people who are enduring thick smoke. The smoke is causing headaches and respiratory issues and carries health risks from toxins and carcinogens. Residents, including children, are suffering both indoors and outdoors. With a haze blanketing vast areas, there is no escape.

These fires are burning in what are known as "zones of control," where authorities are not obligated to extinguish them. In response, a Greenpeace petition has gathered over 400,000 signatures. This public pressure has prompted proposed changes to the law that would shrink these zones of control, increase budgets for fire protection, and help avert future wildfires. These changes would save forests and reduce CO2 emissions.
