Between August 2020 and July 2021, deforestation in the Amazon increased by 21.97%, the highest rate recorded since 2006. A total of 13,235 km² of forest was destroyed under President Bolsonaro's administration, which has slashed environmental protections and weakened monitoring agencies, endangering Indigenous Peoples.

This data was released after the COP26 climate summit, exposing the greenwashing of the Bolsonaro government, as the summit's agreement permits further destruction. Deforestation is a significant contributor to Brazil's high carbon emissions and leads to health risks from fire smoke and climate imbalance. It also fuels violence against Indigenous communities, with 263 Indigenous people killed in 2020.

World leaders must reject deals with Bolsonaro's government. They should demand deforestation-free supply chains and support the sustainable practices of Indigenous Peoples.
