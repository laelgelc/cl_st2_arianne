The IPCC's latest report on climate change impacts, adaptation, and vulnerability highlights widespread losses affecting both nature and people. These risks are escalating at lower levels of warming than were previously assessed.

Current adaptation efforts are insufficient. In vulnerable countries, mortality rates are higher. To reduce these damages, it is necessary to limit global warming to 1.5°C.

The report stresses the importance of ecosystem conservation, noting the need to protect 30-50% of Earth's areas. It critiques unsustainable development and emphasizes the need for urgent global transitions. We must support a Global Ocean Treaty, protect biodiversity, and uphold Indigenous rights. This requires actions such as phasing out fossil fuels.
