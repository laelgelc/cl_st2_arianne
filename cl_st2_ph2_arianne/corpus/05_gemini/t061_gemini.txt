Last weekend, 35,000 people gathered in Lützerath, Germany. They were there to defend the village from demolition for the expansion of RWE's Garzweiler coal mine. The mine sits on top of 280 million tons of lignite and its expansion threatens Germany's Paris Agreement carbon budget, despite there being no energy need.

Activists had occupied the village for over two years and faced violent eviction by police. This protest is a symbol of global resistance against fossil fuel crimes. Similar fights are happening in East Africa, Argentina, India, and North America. Greenpeace supports these communities. We are calling for accountability, as just 100 companies are responsible for 70% of emissions. These companies prioritize profits, which happens amid government complicity.
