Veronica, a mother of two living in Jakarta, took a stand as a plaintiff in a 2021 lawsuit targeting Indonesian officials for their failure to ensure clean air. In a significant ruling, the court found the government had been negligent. It mandated the establishment of air quality standards and the creation of strategies developed with public involvement. The court, however, did not declare the failure to provide clean air a human rights violation.

Following the verdict, Veronica feels a sense of relief, but this is coupled with anxiety about the actual implementation of the court's orders. Her concerns are amplified by persistent environmental problems such as deforestation, forest fires, and the loss of trees in urban centers.

Veronica urges for increased public awareness about the air pollution crisis. She calls for government transparency and the enforcement of strict sanctions against polluters. She also believes in the power of small, individual actions, like using public transport, to contribute to the solution. For Veronica, these combined efforts are crucial to protect vulnerable groups from the severe health and economic consequences of pollution.
