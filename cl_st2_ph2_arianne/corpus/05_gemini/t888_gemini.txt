Since its launch in 2013, the Greenpeace Arctic campaign has mobilized a global movement of over eight million people. This movement is dedicated to establishing a protected sanctuary around the North Pole and halting destructive industries such as oil drilling.

The campaign has achieved significant victories, forcing Shell into retreat and reducing the prospects for Arctic drilling. Issues have been brought to global attention through powerful actions, including a protest in Russia by 30 activists. Dramatic events have spanned the globe, from turning back an icebreaker in Portland to bicycle rallies in Bangkok.

Beyond these visible actions, the campaign has had a deep impact behind the scenes. It has successfully increased the financial and reputational risks for companies involved in the region, weakened corporate-political ties, and helped shift some Arctic nations toward a stance of protection.

At its core, the movement is committed to respecting Indigenous Peoples and inspiring global change.
