An open letter to Chancellor Merkel is urging an immediate moratorium on all tree felling in Hambach Forest. This halt in destruction should continue until the Coal Commission can propose a just coal phase-out that is fully aligned with the Paris Agreement, with a commitment from RWE and the state of North Rhine-Westphalia to respect the outcome.

The letter calls for a 2030 coal phase-out to be legally enshrined in 2019, a move essential for Germany to meet its 2020 climate targets. The ongoing destruction of the forest, coupled with Germany's reliance on coal, has led to escalating conflicts, peaceful protests, and significant damage to the nation's reputation as a climate leader.

The urgency of the situation is compounded by recent extreme weather events and Germany's failure to meet its emissions goals. However, there is growing support for decisive action, including from investors who back a 2030 coal exit for OECD countries. This presents an opportunity for Germany to lead a socially just transition away from coal.
