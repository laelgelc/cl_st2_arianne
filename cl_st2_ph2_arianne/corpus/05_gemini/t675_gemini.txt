The week began with the IPCC report, which urged an urgent response from governments to avert a climate catastrophe. Following this, a series of key developments unfolded.

In the courts, a Dutch ruling mandated the closure of coal plants by 2020. In Germany, court action led to diesel car bans in Berlin, while a Belgian court ordered the creation of a new air pollution plan.

The financial sector also saw movement, as NN Group announced it would cease funding tar sands projects because of their emissions.

At the European Parliament, members backed a target of net-zero emissions by 2050. This goal includes phasing out fossil fuels, boosting energy efficiency, and restoring ecosystems.

Political shifts also became apparent. A group of 15 EU countries began pushing for higher climate targets. These developments occurred amid ongoing debates in Germany about coal and protests in the Hambach forest.
