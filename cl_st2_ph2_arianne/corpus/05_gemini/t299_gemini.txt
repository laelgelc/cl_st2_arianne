The X-Press-Pearl ship disaster in Sri Lanka led to charred debris, hazardous cargo, and billions of plastic nurdles washing up on beaches. In response, a fishing ban was implemented in an 80km radius, which devastated the livelihoods of local fishermen. Their situation was already strained due to pandemic lockdowns and was further compounded by heavy rains and flooding.

Photographer and activist Tashiya documented the crisis, highlighting the chemical contamination, dead marine life, and the long-term damage to the ecosystem. She urges for an end to plastic production and a shift to a sustainable economy. Tashiya also calls for holding corporations accountable and addressing broader capitalist and climate risks to prevent future incidents.
