Biodiversity loss is driven by human greed and exploitation. All life is interconnected, and threats like commercial fisheries, which kill millions of sharks annually, demonstrate the scale of the crisis. The damage is extensive, with only 9% of the world's forests remaining intact and the Amazon undergoing degradation. In the oceans, a mere 3% of the waters are free from human pressure.

A critical opportunity for global protections is approaching with the CBD COP15 in Kunming, China. A proposed global biodiversity fund could be established, starting at $100 billion annually and rising to $700 billion. In addition, China has created a Kunming Fund with an initial $230 million.

As these global targets are negotiated, it is vital to avoid false solutions, such as offsets. It is also essential that Indigenous rights are placed at the heart of proposals like the 30x30 target, recognizing the proven successes of Indigenous communities in protecting nature in places like Brazil and West Papua. As part of the solution for our oceans, Greenpeace has developed a blueprint that maps out a network of sanctuaries.
