Bees are essential for our ecosystems and food production. Three-quarters of global food crops and 84% of Europe's cultivated plants depend on pollinators like bees for their survival. Their contribution to crop pollination is valued at €265 billion, but these vital creatures are vanishing.

The decline is driven by pesticides, such as neonics, and the practices of industrial agriculture, which result in toxic exposures and the deprivation of food sources for bees. This disappearance risks not only our food supplies but also the delicate balance of our ecosystems.

The European Commission has proposed a ban on three specific bee-harming pesticides, and governments are scheduled to vote on this in May. We urge a full ban on all such pesticides and demand the proper testing of other chemicals. We call on politicians to take decisive action to save our pollinators.
