The global air pollution crisis extends far beyond cities like Beijing and Delhi. Many urban areas are grappling with air quality that exceeds safe levels, a problem largely driven by fossil fuel vehicles.

To mark the EU’s Green Week, Greenpeace volunteers took to the streets across Europe to demand change. In Berlin, volunteers demonstrated how cars dominate 60% of street space, leaving a mere 3% for cyclists. Activists in Paris braved the rain to cheer on cyclists. In Rome, campaigners unfurled a banner urging politician Nicola Zingaretti to take action on toxic air. Moscow saw cyclists from the Let’s Bike It initiative raising awareness about health issues. Meanwhile, protests in Belgium included banners, bike-powered events, and flashmobs.

Greenpeace will continue to apply pressure on governments and car companies. We invite you to sign up and join the movement.
