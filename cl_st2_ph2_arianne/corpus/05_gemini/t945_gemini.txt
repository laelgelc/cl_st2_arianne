Aboard our ship, the Esperanza, Greenpeace activists patrolled the Gulf of California for seven days. During this time, we discovered ten illegal gillnets near the Bay of San Felipe and observed boats fishing inside the vaquita's protected habitat.

The vaquita porpoise is facing imminent extinction, with population estimates having dropped from 97 to as few as 57 individuals. The primary cause of this decline is the use of gillnets for catching totoaba, a fish highly valued in China.

After discovering the illegal nets, our team documented and reported them, which led to their removal. We also engaged with local fishermen on the importance of sustainable practices.

Despite an existing two-year fishing ban in the area, monitoring is critically inadequate. There are only two officials to patrol an 11,000 km² area. Without stronger government action, the vaquita's survival is threatened, and the species could be extinct by 2018.
