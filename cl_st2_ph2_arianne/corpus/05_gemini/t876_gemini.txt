On the International Day against Nuclear Tests, we remember the more than 2000 nuclear tests that have occurred since 1945. These tests have led to irreversible radiation contamination and generational harm, a reality faced by communities like the exiled Rongelapese.

Survivors are taking action. The Marshall Islands is pursuing legal action against nuclear states, and Japan's Hibakusha are campaigning against these weapons. Author Bunny McDiarmid recalls her own experience in 1985 aboard the Rainbow Warrior, where she helped relocate Rongelap residents. The ship was later bombed by French agents, a violent act that killed Fernando Pereira.

While protests led to a halt in testing in 1996, the fight is not over. Recent revelations have exposed severe fallout in French Polynesia, and victims continue to struggle for compensation. For these reasons, there is an urgent call for a UN treaty to ban nuclear weapons.
