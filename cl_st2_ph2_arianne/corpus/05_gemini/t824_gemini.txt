Greenpeace delivered books to major publishers in New York, including Macmillan, Penguin Random House, Simon & Schuster, and HarperCollins. These books contained over 500,000 signatures and community photos, representing calls for the publishers to support free speech and the Canadian boreal forest.

The action urged publishers to address their paper sourcing from Resolute Forest Products. Resolute logs intact forests, has lost Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certification on over 6 million hectares, and sues environmental advocates.

Receptions from the publishers varied. Some ignored the delivery or refused meetings. However, Hachette issued an open letter that criticized Resolute's actions and demanded improvements. Greenpeace has vowed to persist in this effort.
