The Dâw Indigenous People, a community of about 140 individuals living in the Waruá community near São Gabriel da Cachoeira, Brazil, experienced a near-total COVID-19 infection. This occurred after they had isolated themselves in the forest for a month, though some visits to town resulted in the spread of the virus.

While most people in the community showed symptoms, limited testing meant not all cases were officially confirmed. No deaths were reported. For their recovery, the Dâw used herbal teas, received medical support from DSEI, and were provided with hygiene supplies.

Echoing the impact of past epidemics, community leaders have expressed a fear of extinction. They are calling for comprehensive testing and improved healthcare. These events are taking place as the Dâw are engaged in ongoing efforts to revitalize their culture and language.
