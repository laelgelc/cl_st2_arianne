Deep sea mining threatens the ocean's unexplored ecosystems and the unique species that inhabit them. It also poses a danger to the ocean's capacity for blue carbon storage, potentially worsening climate change by releasing stored carbon and disrupting marine processes.

The risks associated with this industry include irreversible damage to deep-sea habitats. Sediment plumes, pollution, and disturbances from noise and light can harm wildlife, leading to potential extinctions. While companies downplay these dangers and promote deep sea mining as a "green solution," alternatives like recycling should be urged instead.

Greenpeace is calling for a Global Ocean Treaty to protect international waters. It is essential to build a movement to work towards healthy oceans.
