The Greenpeace ship, Esperanza, is on a tour of the Gulf of California to investigate the presence of toxic chemicals from industrial agriculture. Activists have targeted companies like Bimbo, La Costeña, and Herdez for using harmful fertilizers that pollute waterways and affect people's health.

Sinaloa is a key area of concern, as it produces 38% of Mexico's vegetables and is a leading grain producer, which involves heavy pesticide use. Currently, 29 pesticides that are allowed in Mexico have been banned in other countries.

On a national scale, in 2012, Mexico used 120,000 tons of pesticides and 2 million tons of fertilizers on 22 million hectares. This practice leads to soil pollution, residues in food, and damage to coastal ecosystems, such as the formation of algal blooms.

Greenpeace, along with the UCCS, is documenting these impacts. We are urging authorities and companies to adopt sustainable and organic farming practices.
