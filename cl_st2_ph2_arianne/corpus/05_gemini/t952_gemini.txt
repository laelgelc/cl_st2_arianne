Our global agricultural system is in crisis. We are faced with an industrial, chemical-intensive food system that is causing harm to people, farmers, and the planet. The alternative is a shift towards ecological farming, a model that puts people first. This approach enhances biodiversity, avoids the use of chemicals, and works by integrating science with local knowledge, as outlined in Greenpeace’s Food and Farming Vision.

A personal example of supporting this change can be as simple as a traditional Spanish breakfast made with local, organic ingredients. This one meal represents a move towards a better system.

There are actions we can all take as individuals. We can choose to buy local products, eat less meat, reduce our food waste, and even grow our own food. However, for systemic change to happen, we need more than just individual efforts. It is crucial that governments and companies invest in and support the transition to ecological farming.
