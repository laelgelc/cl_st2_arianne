Governments and corporations must urgently end their addiction to fossil fuels. As a sponsor of the Winter Olympics in South Korea, Samsung has the potential to transform the global tech industry by committing to 100% renewable energy.

Samsung’s energy footprint is larger than that of a small country, yet less than 1% of its energy comes from renewables. Despite its public relations claims, the company instead relies on coal.

Greenpeace, with the support of thousands of people, is calling on Samsung's CEOs to #DoBiggerThings. Global activism is taking place in cities like London and New York to deliver this message. We are also encouraging a virtual banner drop through tweets, pushing the company to make the switch.
