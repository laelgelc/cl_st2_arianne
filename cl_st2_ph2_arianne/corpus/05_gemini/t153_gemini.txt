We are raising the alarm over the disappearance of Indigenista Bruno Araújo Pereira and journalist Dom Phillips in the Amazon's Javari Valley, where they were documenting the region. Amid growing fears for their safety, we call on authorities to urgently investigate.

The dangers in the region have increased under the Bolsonaro government, which fosters a climate of illegal deforestation, fires, and mining. This administration has been marked by leniency on crimes, sabotaged enforcement, and weakened environmental laws.

Furthermore, agribusiness is advancing laws that reward land-grabbing and directly threaten Indigenous lands. During these critical climate and biodiversity crises, we must protect the Amazon from destruction for agriculture.

Greenpeace urges solidarity with Indigenous Peoples. We are committed to defending Indigenous rights.
