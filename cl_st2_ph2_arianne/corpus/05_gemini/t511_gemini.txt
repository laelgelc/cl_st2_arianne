On World Fisheries Day, West African women fish processors gathered in Dakar to protest the loss of their jobs due to the expansion of fishmeal factories. These industrial plants process fresh fish into meal that is used to feed animals in Europe and Asia.

This practice threatens the livelihoods of local communities, undermines food security, and damages marine ecosystems. It also stands in contradiction to the UN's sustainable development goals. In Senegal, the fisheries sector is a critical part of the economy and food system, providing over 600,000 jobs and meeting 70% of the country's animal protein needs.

The women are urging their government to halt the development of any new factories and to stop the use of edible fish for the production of fishmeal. They are asking for support for their own businesses, such as the provision of refrigerating units, highlighting that artisanal processing creates far more jobs than the industrial factories do.
