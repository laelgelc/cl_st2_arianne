Thousands of people worldwide have joined Greenpeace's call demanding that Samsung reuse or recycle 4.3 million Galaxy Note7 phones.

To amplify this message, cyberactivists launched a 24-hour tweetstorm using the hashtag #SaveTheGalaxy. Their efforts resulted in #GalaxyNote7 becoming a trending topic in Mexico. Supporters from numerous countries, including Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Mexico, the US, UK, Germany, the Netherlands, Australia, and Colombia, have also been calling Samsung directly. The responses from the company regarding its disposal plans have been mixed; some callers were told the phones would be destroyed, some were told they would be recycled, while others received no information.

In addition to online and phone actions, Greenpeace Korea held a protest at Samsung's headquarters. Activists urged CEO Kwon Oh-hyun to rethink the company's product design and commit to reusing materials from the recalled devices.

A petition supporting the cause has gathered over 30,000 signatures. People are being encouraged to take action by signing the petition, calling Samsung, and sharing the campaign.
