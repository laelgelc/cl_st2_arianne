We are celebrating a momentous victory. After a three-month campaign backed by over one million people worldwide, LEGO has announced it will end its contract with Shell. This success is a testament to the power of collective action, with a global community emailing LEGO to demand it sever ties with the oil giant.

The victory exposes Shell's strategy of using partnerships with beloved brands to polish its public image, even as it faces widespread opposition to its plans for Arctic drilling.

Our campaign was defined by several key moments. A viral video reached nearly six million views, spreading the message far and wide. Children took a stand by building LEGO Arctic animals in protest at Shell's London headquarters. Miniature LEGO figures joined global "LEGOlution" protests, and a daring LEGO climber action took place at a Shell station in Legoland. It was this massive public outcry that made the difference.

With Arctic sea ice at record lows, the threat to this fragile environment is more urgent than ever. Now that LEGO has made its decision, we urge Shell to abandon its Arctic plans for good.
