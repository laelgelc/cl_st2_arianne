In 2019, global military spending reached $1.9 trillion, marking a 3.6% increase. This spending continued to rise in 2020, with the United States increasing its budget by 5.3% and Germany by 10%.

These costs stand in stark contrast to healthcare needs. The price of a single Leopard 2 tank is equivalent to that of 440 ventilators. Global budgets for nuclear weapons are ten times the combined budgets of the United Nations and the World Health Organization.

The COVID-19 pandemic exposes these misplaced priorities. There is an urgent need to shift focus from militarism to funding healthcare, poverty reduction, and environmental protection. We must call for budgets to be reallocated and support a global ceasefire. Use the #movethemoney and #Doves4Peace campaigns to join this call.
