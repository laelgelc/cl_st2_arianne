This year, Russia’s Amur region is experiencing its worst wildfires. Fueled by low winter snow and strong winds, these fires are transforming former forests into burning wastelands. Only areas of permafrost have been spared.

The fires are releasing massive amounts of CO2, which hinders the achievement of Paris Agreement goals. They also spread soot that accelerates the melting of Arctic ice. Greenpeace advocates for the recognition of wildfire emissions in national carbon plans and urges action in affected countries, including Russia.

Human activity, such as careless burning, is the cause of most fires. Prevention is key and involves education, proper fire extinguishing techniques, and reporting fires when they are spotted. In response, Greenpeace Russia has launched the Fire initiative to raise awareness and help reduce the severity of these wildfires.

This crisis is part of a global problem, with major fires also occurring in Indonesia, the US, Canada, and Brazil. So far, over two million hectares have burned in the Amur region, emitting 110 megatonnes of CO2.
