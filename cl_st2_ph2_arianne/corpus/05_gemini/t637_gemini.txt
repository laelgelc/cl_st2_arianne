Seabirds, especially albatrosses, are facing severe threats from human activities. Industrial overfishing depletes the prey fish they depend on, leading to population declines of up to 70% since 1950.

Additional dangers for these birds include becoming bycatch in fishing gear and suffering from plastic pollution, which is responsible for killing over a million birds annually. They are also threatened by invasive species, historical feather harvesting, collisions, oil spills, and toxic chemicals.

CO2 emissions contribute to ocean acidification, which has increased the ocean's acidity by 30% since the Industrial Revolution. This process harms marine life, including corals and shellfish. Studies highlight these ecosystem disruptions, prompting calls for expanded marine reserves, bans on trawling, and restoration efforts to aid in the recovery of seabird populations.
