A supplier for Sprite, La Moraleja S.A., has illegally deforested 3,000 hectares of protected native forests in Argentina. This destruction, carried out for lemon juice production, violated the country's 2007 National Forest Law and has harmed local wildlife and the forests that act as vital climate defenses.

Since 2013, Greenpeace has been exposing this environmental damage and pressuring Sprite and its parent company, Coca-Cola, which claims to focus on sustainability. Public pressure has been immense, with over 300,000 people demanding that these companies take action.

This pressure has led to consequences for the supplier. La Moraleja has lost its Rainforest Alliance certification. In response, the company has committed to restoring a portion of the forest, but its pledge covers only 1,400 hectares.

This is not enough. We are demanding the full restoration of all 3,000 hectares of protected forest that were destroyed. We also call for the implementation of a zero deforestation policy. Please join us in holding Sprite accountable by signing the petition.
