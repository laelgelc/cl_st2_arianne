Europe is confronting catastrophic wildfires from the Mediterranean to the Arctic. This includes the Great Northern Forest, which extends from Sweden to the Russian Far East.

Climate change triggers these fires by causing extreme weather such as heatwaves. The fires then worsen climate change by destroying vital forests. These fires can emit up to 25% of annual CO2 emissions, along with black carbon that affects the Arctic.

In Russia, 12.6 million hectares have burned, with 2.9 million hectares still actively on fire. Meanwhile, Sweden is facing record fires in as many as 60 locations.

Most of these fires are human-caused, and caution is urged. There is also a call for the emissions from these fires to be included in the Paris Agreement.
