Greenpeace is marking 50 years since its founding in Vancouver in 1971. The organisation originated with activists who protested a US nuclear test on Amchitka Island by sailing a renamed boat, the "Greenpeace." This action pressured the United States to cancel future tests and also inspired campaigns against French tests.

From these beginnings, the group expanded its focus to include anti-whaling efforts, using Zodiac boats in its campaigns. These actions led to global recognition and the eventual formation of Greenpeace International.

Despite 50 years of activism, environmental conditions have worsened. The planet is experiencing biodiversity loss and rising emissions, which signal an ecological "overshoot" crisis. Achieving sustainability requires reduced human population and consumption.
