A Greenpeace survey of smartphone habits in the USA, Germany, Russia, Mexico, South Korea, and China has highlighted significant environmental and health concerns. The manufacturing process for smartphones uses hazardous chemicals like benzene and n-hexane, which pose health risks.

Our findings show that consumers are aware of these issues. Four out of five respondents said they would prioritize a phone made without hazardous chemicals. There is also a strong desire for devices that are easy to repair, with up to 95% of respondents in China supporting this. Furthermore, people want their devices to be easily recycled.

Despite this, repair habits vary greatly. In China and South Korea, repair rates are 66% and 64% respectively. This is significantly higher than in the US, where the rate is 28%, and Germany, at 23%.

Over half of all respondents believe that manufacturers release too many new models and that these same companies should be responsible for recycling the devices they produce. The environmental impact is substantial, with smartphones generating nearly three million tonnes of e-waste annually.

Greenpeace is calling for the creation of sustainable gadgets and invites you to join us in this effort.
