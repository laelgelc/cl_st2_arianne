The film The Graduate serves as a reference point for the rise of plastics, which have been accumulating since the 1950s. This has led to the pollution of our oceans, such as the North Pacific gyre, where plastic now outweighs plankton. This pollution harms marine life.

Plastic is ingested by a range of animals including seabirds, turtles, fish, and mammals. This ingestion can cause physical obstruction and toxicity. The consequences are severe, leading to up to a million seabird deaths and 100,000 mammal deaths every year.

There are solutions to this crisis. These include implementing global bans on single-use plastics and ensuring corporate accountability through Extended Producer Responsibility. Investing in public water infrastructure is another proposed solution. Greenpeace is urging G20 nations to prioritize prevention by phasing out throwaway items and fostering innovation to address the problem.
