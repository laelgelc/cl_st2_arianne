In a critical move to protect our oceans and climate, Greenpeace Argentina, in collaboration with local organizations, has filed a class action lawsuit and an injunction against the Argentine State. The legal action seeks to declare the unconstitutionality of government resolutions that approve offshore oil exploration permits for major corporations, including ExxonMobil and Shell.

These destructive projects, which involve activities like seismic blasting off the coast of Buenos Aires, are a direct violation of the constitutional right to a healthy environment. They pose a significant threat to biodiversity and will only exacerbate the ongoing climate crisis, all for the benefit of corporate interests.

Our lawsuit demands that a stable climate be recognized as a fundamental human right and that the state prioritizes a transition to renewable energy. This legal challenge is supported by a history of successful climate litigations in countries like the Netherlands, Germany, France, and Brazil, which have set powerful international precedents.

The fight is not confined to the courts. Thousands of people have mobilized in protest against these projects, demonstrating widespread public opposition. Through this collective action, we aim to set a lasting precedent that will safeguard our environment for future generations.
