After running into overtime negotiations, the 27th UN Climate Change Conference has concluded. A key victory was the establishment of a Loss and Damage fund, which will aid communities impacted by the climate crisis. This achievement, however, came amid significant disappointments.

Despite calls from many countries, no agreement was reached on a fossil fuel phase-out. This failure now increases the pressure for action at COP28. Billed as an 'implementation' and 'Africa COP,' the conference ultimately delivered little on strengthened national plans to limit warming to 1.5°C. This could potentially mark a retreat from the targets set in Paris.

Urgent action remains a necessity. Polluters must fund adaptation, mitigation, and a just transition. The work continues as people power pushes forward in the UAE next year.
