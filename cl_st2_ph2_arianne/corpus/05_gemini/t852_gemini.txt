Our Detox Outdoor campaign, which launched in late 2015, has achieved a significant victory with the help of the outdoor community and supporters. Gore Fabrics, the supplier of GORE-TEX® to well-known brands such as The North Face and Mammut, has now committed to eliminating hazardous PFCs from its products.

This success was driven by hundreds of thousands of actions, including online petitions, votes for product testing, and over 150 activities organized globally to pressure outdoor brands.

Early industry leaders like Paramo, Rotauf, and Vaude signed PFC-free commitments and urged Gore to take action. As a result of this collective pressure, Gore Fabrics has committed to removing hazardous PFCs from its general laminates by 2020 and from its specialized laminates by 2023.
