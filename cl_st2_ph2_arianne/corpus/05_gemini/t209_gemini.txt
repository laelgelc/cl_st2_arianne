Fossil fuel companies like Shell, Total, and Eni are using glossy ads and sponsorships with images of rainbows, happy cows, and wildlife to greenwash their image. To expose these manipulative strategies, volunteers from Greenpeace and other groups have documented over 100 examples in 40 European cities.

These examples are collected on the interactive #BanFossilAds map, which allows users to upload photos and details of misleading advertisements. Documented cases include sponsorships of cultural events by companies such as Acea, Lexus, Plenoil, and Endesa. This tactic is used to gain social acceptance and block climate action.

Director Adam McKay has advocated for banning such ads, drawing a parallel to the ban on cigarette advertising. You can help by using the map's toolkit to document these claims and by signing the European Citizens’ Initiative for a ban. The initiative requires 1 million signatures to move forward.
