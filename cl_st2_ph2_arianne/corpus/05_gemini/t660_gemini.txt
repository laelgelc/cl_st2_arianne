A Greenpeace team has visited the scorched Pribaikalsky wildlife reserve, a UNESCO site located on the shore of Lake Baikal. A wildfire in 2015 destroyed 60% of the reserve's vegetation. Three years on, the area shows little sign of recovery and is now being subjected to logging.

During the visit, we met Solbon Sandgiev, a volunteer firefighter from the Buryat Indigenous group. He stressed the cultural importance of preserving nature and voiced his fear of losing their homeland as man-made wildfires increase. In Russia, over 90% of wildfires are caused by humans.

With authorities failing to manage the situation, volunteers are on the front lines combating these fires. They are urging the public to show respect for the forests and are calling for donations to help support their equipment needs.
