In 1996, Greenpeace founders Dorothy Stowe, Jim Bohlen, Bob Hunter, and Dorothy Metcalfe gathered in Vancouver to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the organization’s 1971 launch.

During the gathering, they recounted the group’s origins, which began as the "Don't Make a Wave Committee" to protest U.S. nuclear tests on Amchitka. They recalled the first voyage on the Phyllis Cormack, which was renamed Greenpeace. The organization's early activities were funded through donations and concerts. The founders discussed their use of media strategies and non-violent direct actions. These efforts led to successes, such as halting the nuclear tests and the creation of a nature reserve. They also acknowledged the internal conflicts the group faced as it evolved into an international environmental force.
