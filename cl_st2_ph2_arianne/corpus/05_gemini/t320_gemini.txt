Inspired by Vandana Shiva's International Women’s Day address, we honor women who have been pivotal to ecological awareness. Shiva’s address draws a link between the colonization of the Earth and the emancipation of women, which can be achieved through food security and the protection of Indigenous seeds.

This tradition of ecological stewardship includes figures such as Stephanie Mills, who focused on population impacts, and Donella Meadows, known for her work on systems theory and *Limits to Growth*. Rachel Carson’s book, *Silent Spring*, exposed the dangers of chemicals, and Alice Hamilton pioneered industrial toxicology reforms.

The history of environmental action also highlights Greenpeace founders like Dorothy Stowe and Marie Bohlen. They follow in a long line of activism that includes the ancient Bishnoi tree-huggers and the Chipko movement. Today, this legacy is carried on by modern activists like Greta Thunberg. These women have all played important roles in the fight for environmental justice and in fostering paradigm shifts.
