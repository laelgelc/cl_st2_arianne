Oil companies are exploiting the COVID-19 pandemic to advance their agenda, promoting single-use plastics by spreading misinformation. They are using this crisis to lobby for industry bailouts and the weakening of environmental regulations.

Contrary to these claims, reusables such as cups and bags can be used safely. This has been confirmed by nearly 130 health experts from around the world, who state that proper washing is the key to safety. The idea that plastic is inherently more sanitary is false; in fact, the virus can survive longer on plastic surfaces than it does on cardboard. For this reason, it is important to wash produce regardless of what kind of packaging it comes in.

We must also remember the broader environmental consequences of plastic. It causes pollution, contributes to climate impacts, and places a heavy waste burden on low-income communities. Our decisions should be guided by science, not by the self-serving interests of industry lobbyists.
