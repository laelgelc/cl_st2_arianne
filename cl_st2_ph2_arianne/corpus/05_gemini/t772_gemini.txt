Around the world, inspiring women are at the forefront of environmental efforts. Kanahus Manuel, an Indigenous leader from Canada's Secwepemc First Nation, is engaged in the fight against the Trans Mountain pipeline, which is part of an intergenerational struggle for rights.

Elsewhere, Sandra Guzmán researches climate impacts in Antarctica and works to empower women in the field of science. In Chad, Hindou Oumarou Ibrahim integrates Indigenous knowledge with science to address climate adaptation. Her organization, AFPAT, uses 3D mapping to achieve this.

In Indonesia, DJ Ninda Felina uses her musical skills for environmental education. Through the Save Our Sounds project, she records forest sounds and incorporates them into her music to inspire rainforest protection.

These heroes use their skills to empower their communities and foster hope for a better world.
