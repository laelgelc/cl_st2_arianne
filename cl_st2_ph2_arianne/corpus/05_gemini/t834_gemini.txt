Our global forest campaign pressures companies to protect forests, leading to successes in places like Canada, Brazil, and Indonesia. Now, our Great Northern Forest campaign is focused on the destruction of the boreal forest in Russia's Arkhangelsk region.

A Greenpeace report has exposed that even companies certified by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) are logging Intact Forest Landscapes in the area. In response, FSC Russia has acknowledged that industry transformation and customer pressure are needed to establish the Dvinsky Forest Reserve.

We are urging companies such as Pomor Timber, Titan, and Arkhangelsk Pulp & Paper to support the creation of this reserve. They have until June 2017 to take action. If they fail to do so, they will face potential contract suspensions and boycotts.
