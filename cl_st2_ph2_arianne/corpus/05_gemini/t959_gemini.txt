Following campaigns by ForestEthics and Greenpeace, 3M has announced a global sustainable paper buying policy with the goal of avoiding forest destruction.

Key elements of the policy prohibit paper from sources that threaten High Conservation Value Forests, Intact Forest Landscapes, or High Carbon Stock areas. The policy also mandates Free, Prior and Informed Consent from indigenous communities and ensures the protection of worker rights, including the prohibition of forced or child labor and the freedom to unionize. Furthermore, 3M has committed to increasing its use of recycled and tree-free paper while reducing its overall consumption. The company will provide public performance reports with The Forest Trust to ensure transparency.

In line with this new policy, 3M has already cut ties with a subsidiary of RGE, which has been linked to rainforest destruction by APRIL in Indonesia. The company has also warned Resolute Forest Products that it must comply with the new standards or risk losing 3M's business, a move that addresses issues of habitat degradation and conflicts with indigenous communities.
