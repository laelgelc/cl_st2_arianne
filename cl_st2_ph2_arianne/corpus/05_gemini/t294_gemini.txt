In Bolsonaro's Brazil, Indigenous Peoples' rights and their lands face immense threats. One of the most severe is the Marco Temporal loophole, a legal maneuver that could legalize land theft. This loophole would require Indigenous communities to prove they were occupying their lands at the time of the 1988 constitution, a move that dangerously ignores their centuries of presence.

Alongside this, bill PL 490 aims to open up Indigenous territories for industrial agriculture and mining. This legislation directly endangers isolated communities.

Greenpeace supports the critical work of defending these rights, emphasizing the vital role of Indigenous Peoples as guardians of the forest. The Articulation of Indigenous Peoples of Brazil (APIB) is urging the Supreme Court to declare the Marco Temporal unconstitutional, with legal proceedings scheduled to resume on August 25. The struggle for justice has been met with hostility; in June 2021, protesters in Brasília faced violence while demanding their rights be protected.
