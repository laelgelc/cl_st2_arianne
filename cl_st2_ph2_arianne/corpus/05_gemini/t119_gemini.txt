A 2021 study highlighted the scale of climate anxiety, finding that 84% of young people are worried about the climate crisis. Over 45% of them reported that these feelings affect their daily lives. For those looking for ways to cope, several podcasts can help.

"Climate and You," by Domyo Burk, explores the emotions connected to the climate crisis and discusses how to stay engaged without despair. Another option is "Climate Change and Happiness" with Panu Pihkala and Thomas Doherty, which encourages listeners to articulate their fears and find ways to work through them.

For those seeking energizing stories about action, "How to Save A Planet" offers a humorous approach. The podcast covers ideas like Ayana Elizabeth Johnson's Venn diagram and includes episodes with Britt Wray. Finally, "Outrage + Optimism" aims to balance justified outrage with optimism. The show has featured guests like David Attenborough, as well as Luisa Neubauer, who has discussed studies on youth anxiety.
