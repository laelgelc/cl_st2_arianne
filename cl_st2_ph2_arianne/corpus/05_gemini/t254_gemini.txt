Our global food system is broken. It harms health, damages the environment, and worsens inequality. At the same time, food is wasted while people experience widespread hunger.

In the face of this, people are creating change. During the Covid-19 pandemic, Supawut Boonmahathanakorn and his team in Chiang Mai, Thailand, witnessed the food insecurity affecting the urban poor and took action. They transformed a 4,800-square-meter vacant dumping ground into an urban farm.

With the backing of the community and local municipality, the farm now grows organic produce, including morning glories and corn. The harvests are shared, and any excess is sold to ensure the project can sustain itself. The initiative also supports soup kitchens and provides educational spaces. This project is a clear example of a people-powered solution, forging a path toward food sovereignty.
