With 2018 marked by fires, soaring temperatures, and hurricanes, it has been declared the climate year. The IPCC has confirmed that we are living in a changing world that is set to worsen.

In the face of this, leadership is emerging from the most vulnerable developing countries. The Climate Vulnerable Forum’s (CVF) Virtual Summit, hosted by the Marshall Islands, is showcasing this leadership. The Marshall Islands, for example, has put forward a plan for 100% renewables and net-zero emissions by 2050.

The CVF is comprised of frontline nations who have a history of climate leadership; they were influential in shaping the Paris Agreement and its 1.5-degree goal. This online summit, held just before COP24, serves as a platform to urge major polluters and governments to take urgent action on climate change.
