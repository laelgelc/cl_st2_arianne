Mike Fincken, who served as a judge in the #SaveTheArctic poster competition and is the captain of Greenpeace's Arctic Sunrise, has selected the winners. He chose Anastasia, 21, from Russia; Sara, 18, from Spain; and Emile, 20, from Canada. The winners will join him on a voyage to the Arctic.

Captain Fincken reviewed more than 2000 entries that were submitted from 75 different countries. While judging, he tweeted some of his favorites, including posters titled "Bear Walks into a Bar," one showing giraffes above rising seas, another depicting a fist throttling a polar bear, and a version of Life of Pi with Arctic animals.

The posters were described as embodying "artivism," which is the act of fighting injustice through art. Fincken urges people to use their social media platforms to amplify efforts to #SaveTheArctic.
