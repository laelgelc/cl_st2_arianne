In the isolated Canadian Arctic town of Kangiqtugaapik, where Clara Natanine lives, a community of about 1,000 people relies on hunting marine animals. Amid high prices in stores, narwhals, bowheads, and seals provide essential food.

This way of life now faces a threat from energy companies planning seismic blasting in the local waters. This activity endangers the wildlife and, with it, the Inuit cultural traditions that have been tied to the land and sea for thousands of years.

Despite a history of oppression, the people of Kangiqtugaapik are resilient. They are rallying to protect their rights and their sustainable ways of life, urging for support to help them stop the blasting.
