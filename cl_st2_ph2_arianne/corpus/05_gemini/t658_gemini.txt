For two years, Greenpeace's campaign aboard the Esperanza ship worked to highlight the wonders of the Amazon Reef and protect it from oil drilling by companies such as Total. Alongside over two million Amazon Reef Defenders from around the globe, including scientists and local communities, a historic victory was achieved: Brazil's environmental agency, Ibama, denied Total's license to drill.

The campaign's actions ranged from capturing the first-ever images of the reef to disrupting a meeting held by Total. This defeat of a powerful company is a signal of the growing movement to end the oil age. The fight, however, continues for the full protection of the reef. The supporters who made this possible are hailed as heroes.
