During Plastic Free July, many people take personal action to reduce single-use plastic by using reusable cups, bags, and bottles. While these steps are important, they make only a small impact on the overall problem.

The focus must be on holding major polluters accountable. Companies like PepsiCo, Nestlé, Unilever, and Coca-Cola have made negligible efforts in reuse and refill systems. Coca-Cola has made a commitment to make 25% of its packaging reusable by 2030, but it needs to improve its efforts. PepsiCo has stated it plans to set a refill goal by the end of the year.

We urge you to demand that these corporations shift to reuse systems. You can help by signing the Greenpeace petition and downloading our toolkit to pressure them to change.
