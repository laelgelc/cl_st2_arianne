For a century, the automobile has dominated, leading to high vehicle ownership in countries like the UK and the USA. However, a shift is occurring, particularly among young people, who are increasingly turning to bicycles, public transport, and trains due to the costs associated with cars.

This trend is visible in cities around the world. In Berlin, public transport is the preferred option. Copenhagen has achieved a 62% rate of commutes by bicycle. Lyon has seen a 20% decrease in cars entering the city, accompanied by growth in bike hires. In London, car journeys have fallen by 25% since 1990. The popularity of car-free days is also growing, with events like Bogota's week-long initiative.

While electric cars are a positive development, true sustainability requires more. It demands a reduced reliance on cars, supported by the creation of cycle lanes, a variety of transport options, and affordable, clean mass transit.

Greenpeace's report, *Freedom to Breathe: Rethinking Urban Transport*, envisions this future. The report highlights the wastefulness of cars, which are resource-intensive to produce, sit idle 95% of the time, and require vast areas for parking. For instance, parking takes up 14% of the land in LA County. The evidence shows that when cities provide viable alternatives, they can successfully change people's travel habits.
