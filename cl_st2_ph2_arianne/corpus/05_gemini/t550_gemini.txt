According to Annisa Rahmawati, a forests campaigner for Greenpeace Indonesia, the country's vast, biodiversity-rich forests are a major source of carbon emissions due to deforestation and fires, a crisis that parallels what is happening in places like the Amazon. She has stated that governments are complicit and urges companies to drop suppliers linked to deforestation. Rahmawati also calls on consumers to demand that commodities such as palm oil, soya, and meat are deforestation-free.

In 2018, a Greenpeace campaign mobilized 1.5 million people against Wilmar and Mondelez. This action led to Wilmar strengthening its No Deforestation, No Peat, No Exploitation (NDPE) commitments and resulted in a joint statement to establish a monitoring platform. However, collaborations in 2019 did not succeed in creating a credible platform, which prompted Greenpeace to withdraw from the process.
