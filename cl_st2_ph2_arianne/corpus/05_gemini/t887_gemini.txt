As a volunteer deckhand aboard the Greenpeace ship Arctic Sunrise, I sailed from Svalbard into uncharted northern waters. There, I witnessed stunning ice formations, glaciers calving, and snow-capped mountains. The region was alive with wildlife, including seals and birds. I was overwhelmed by the Arctic's beauty.

This experience contrasts sharply with the failure of OSPAR nations in Tenerife to establish an Arctic sanctuary. Norway, Denmark, and Iceland refused negotiations, leaving this pristine region vulnerable to destructive fishing and oil drilling.

Having previously campaigned against oil companies, seeing this incredible place firsthand has strengthened my resolve. I urge others to raise their voices to protect the Arctic.
