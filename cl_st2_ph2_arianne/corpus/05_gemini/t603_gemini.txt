In April 2019, while Arctic temperatures were 8 degrees above normal, Greenpeace organized a concert to highlight the region's fragility and the risk of melting. The event featured musicians playing instruments, including chimes, horns, percussion, and a cello, that were carved from glacier ice.

Led by oceans campaigner Halvard Haga Raavand, the concert was held in -12°C conditions. The event's purpose was to urge world leaders to protect 30% of the world's oceans by the year 2030. Oceans serve as a climate buffer by absorbing carbon through marine life, and the melting of Arctic ice contributes to the acceleration of global warming.

This concert marked the start of a research voyage to the Antarctic to advocate for a Global Oceans Treaty.
