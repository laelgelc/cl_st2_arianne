According to Annisa Rahmawaiti, a forest campaigner for Greenpeace Indonesia, companies are playing a role in the destruction of rainforests for palm oil. To highlight this, Greenpeace activists delivered a giant cookie to Mondelez, the maker of Oreos. The action was a call for the company to stop sourcing palm oil from rainforest destroyers, including Wilmar International.

In 2010, Mondelez promised to end deforestation in its supply chain by 2020. However, between 2015 and 2017, its suppliers were responsible for clearing over 70,000 hectares of rainforest. This destruction included 25,000 hectares of orangutan habitat.

Annisa Rahmawaiti calls for Mondelez to cut its ties with Wilmar. She emphasizes the need for sustainable palm oil production and urges supporters to join the campaign. The goal is to protect Indonesia's forests and combat climate change.
