From July 2021 to August 2022, Brazil's INPE reported the deforestation of 11,568 square kilometers of the Amazon, an area equivalent to 1.6 million soccer fields.

During the presidency of Jair Bolsonaro, from 2019 to 2022, a total of 45,586 square kilometers of the Amazon was lost. This represents a 53% increase compared to the period from 2015 to 2018. This rise in deforestation was a result of his anti-environment and anti-Indigenous policies. These policies enabled illegal logging, mining, and land-grabbing. Furthermore, no new Indigenous Lands have been recognized since 1988.

The Amazon is now approaching a tipping point, with some parts of the forest emitting more carbon than they store. Deforestation, which leads to fires, is responsible for 40% of Brazil's emissions. These fires also harm public health, a concern that was heightened amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

Bolsonaro was defeated in the election by Lula, who has pledged to protect the Amazon and attended COP27. To succeed, Lula must implement robust plans to curb the destruction, protect the rights of Indigenous peoples, and enforce accountability.
