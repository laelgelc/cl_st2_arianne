Interconnected global crises, including climate change, right-wing populism, health issues, discrimination, inequality, and economic pressures, are fostering a sense of hopelessness. In response, Greenpeace Europe is emphasizing the need for intersectional campaigning that integrates environmentalism with people, politics, and the economy to address the root causes of these problems.

To explore this further, four climate justice activists were interviewed. Guppi Bola discussed the importance of decolonising economics to achieve racial and climate justice. Chihiro Geuzebroek spoke about halting production, the concept of a universal basic income, and the need for an ethical transformation of work. Tatiana Garavito focused on creating new systems for nourishment that are free from exploitation. Samie Blasingame addressed the need to reform global food systems and advocated for treating agricultural land as a global common.

The call is to center these voices as we work to reimagine and build a better world.
