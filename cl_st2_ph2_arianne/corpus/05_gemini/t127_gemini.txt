The government of the Democratic Republic of Congo has put 27 oil and three gas blocks up for auction, many of which overlap with highly sensitive ecosystems like peatlands and the iconic Virunga National Park. This move has been presented as an act of nationalism, aimed at boosting the economy and prioritizing people over wildlife.

However, critics contend that this path primarily enriches elites and entrenches neo-colonialism, benefiting foreign powers that are seeking alternatives to Russian fuel. Meanwhile, local communities are harmed through displacement, pollution, and disrupted livelihoods, all without being consulted.

True nationalism requires a different vision. It involves reimagining development by investing in local manufacturing, solar energy, nature conservation, and eco-tourism. This alternative approach would foster jobs, encourage good governance, and lead to an equitable distribution of wealth, calling into question whether the current socio-economic model is truly effective for Africa.
