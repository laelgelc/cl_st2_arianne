The fast fashion industry's environmental impact is significant, fueled by an obsession with consumption. Annually, 80 billion garments are produced, with most ending up in landfills. The resources required are immense; a single pair of jeans uses 7,000 liters of water, and chemical dyeing contributes to pollution. This growth is driven by rising consumption, with the average American's clothing purchases increasing from 34 items in 1991 to 67 in 2007.

Consumers are urged to avoid impulse buys and to consider the garment workers behind their clothes, a point highlighted by the anniversary of the Rana Plaza collapse. While some companies promote donation and recycling efforts, such as H&M's program, these are not a solution. Only 1% of clothing collected through these schemes is turned into recycled fibers.

Instead of relying on these programs, we can upcycle 95% of our discarded clothing. Another option is to simply keep old clothes, as trends often cycle back. As Vivienne Westwood advises: "Buy less, choose well, make it last."
