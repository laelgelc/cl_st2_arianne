The Amazon is facing a crisis of record deforestation. According to data from INPE, 9,762 km² of the forest were destroyed between August 2018 and July 2019. This marks a 30% increase in destruction and is the highest level recorded since 2008.

President Bolsonaro's anti-environmental policies have led to weakened protections. Inspections by the environmental agency IBAMA have been cut by 22%, and budgets for fighting fires have been reduced by 38%. During the period of raging fires, the director of INPE was dismissed.

This crisis also involves the violation of Indigenous rights, exemplified by the murder of forest guardian Paulo Paulino Guajajara. The rate of destruction is accelerating, with deforestation warnings increasing by 100% between August and October 2019.

Urgent action is required. We must support the forest guardians who protect the Amazon and reject products like beef and soya that are linked to deforestation.
