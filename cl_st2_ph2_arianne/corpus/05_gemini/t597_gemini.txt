To protect our planet and our health, we must abolish polluting internal combustion engine (ICE) cars. Since 1990, transport emissions have surged, rising 25% in Europe and 74% globally. Road transport is the overwhelming cause, accounting for 70% of these emissions.

Banning petrol and diesel vehicles is crucial for cutting these emissions, but it also directly protects human health. The pollution from these cars contributes to lung cancer, asthma, and heart disease, with health risks that are worse than those from smoking.

To accelerate this necessary transition, Greenpeace has created a map tracking the phase-out dates for petrol and diesel cars worldwide. We encourage cities to use this as a tool to compete for who can become the cleanest, and for citizens to push their representatives for firm restrictions and to hold them accountable.

By promoting walking, cycling, renewable-powered public transport, and shared electric vehicles, we can redesign our cities to be centered around people, not cars.
