Greenpeace Denmark activist Ida Marie has recounted her experience peacefully occupying the Dan Bravo oil rig in the North Sea. As part of a campaign against oil and gas exploration, she and three others swam 500 meters from the Rainbow Warrior ship to the rig, where they remained for 36 hours.

To prepare for the action, Ida Marie trained for a month, undertaking physical challenges that included swimming with heavy bags and climbing ladders. During the occupation, the activists camped on the rig’s helipad, enduring windy conditions. While there, they unfurled a banner and recorded a message thanking supporters.

Following the activists' occupation, Total shut down production on the rig. The activists swam back to the ship because of approaching bad weather. Ida Marie urges support for a fossil-free #NorthSeaRevolution.
