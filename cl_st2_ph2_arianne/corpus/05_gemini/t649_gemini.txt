It has been a year of campaigning against forest destruction for palm oil, a year in which we have exposed Wilmar's links to rainforest destroyers and their sales to global brands.

Our actions have taken many forms. Murals were painted in 20 cities, we occupied a Wilmar refinery, and on two occasions, we intercepted tankers. We also confronted Mondelez over its connection to dirty palm oil, holding protests and blockades at its sites in Italy, Germany, the UK, and the USA.

Over 1.3 million supporters joined in, pressuring brands to change. This collective action led Wilmar to publish a new plan to map its suppliers and to halt purchases from those responsible for destruction.

With under 400 days left to meet 2020 commitments, Greenpeace will now monitor the implementation of this plan to ensure it helps to end deforestation.
