For World Photography Day, we highlight the power of photography in environmental activism through Greenpeace images from 2019 that captured global events.

These images feature activists climbing an oil rig in Norway to protest Arctic drilling and document Brazil's Acampamento Terra Livre indigenous assembly for rights and territory demarcation. Photography captured the flooding in Louisiana after Hurricane Barry, fires in South Korea, and a crab trapped in plastic in the Philippines. Images also showed the aftermath of a Vale dam collapse in Brazil and coal plant expansion in Indonesia. Around the world, photographs documented the #FridaysForFuture student strikes demanding climate action. Finally, they followed Greenpeace's pole-to-pole ocean expedition, which researched threats to our oceans, including climate change and pollution.
