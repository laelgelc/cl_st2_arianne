The loss of biodiversity is linked to an increase in infectious disease risks. COVID-19 is an example of how the destruction of ecosystems, deforestation, and the wildlife trade expose humans to zoonotic threats. Because this is a global issue, it requires cross-border solutions.

The Convention on Biological Diversity has put forward a "protect 30" proposal to safeguard at least 30% of the world's land and oceans by 2030 through sanctuaries. The success of this plan depends on respecting indigenous rights, empowering women, and engaging with communities. It also requires international support for frontline communities so they can implement these protections.
