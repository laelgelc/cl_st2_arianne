Air pollution poses a significant health risk, with 99% of the global population exposed to levels considered unsafe by World Health Organization guidelines. This crisis is also an equity issue, and Greenpeace is taking action across the globe to address it.

In India, the "Power The Pedal" campaign was launched to empower low-wage women in Delhi and Bengaluru by providing them with bicycles, promoting cleaner transport. Additionally, a petition, delivered with an art installation, called for the revision of national air quality standards. In Indonesia, Greenpeace supported a successful lawsuit which upheld the right of Jakarta's citizens to clean air.

Meanwhile, in Malaysia, a human rights complaint was filed, and public awareness was raised through murals and art installations. A banner was also used to demand a Clean Air Act. In Bogotá, Colombia, a clean air capsule was deployed to highlight the city's pollution problem. These global efforts underscore the fight for clean air as a fundamental right.
