In October 2017, eight Greenpeace France activists conducted a non-violent direct action by infiltrating the Cattenom nuclear plant. They successfully reached the building housing the spent fuel pool and set off fireworks to expose the grave security vulnerabilities in France's aging reactors. Their action was designed to show that if these facilities were attacked, a massive release of radioactivity could occur.

The exposure of this security flaw alarmed the neighbouring country of Luxembourg and triggered a French parliamentary investigation into the matter.

Despite highlighting a critical public safety issue, the activists, known as the "Cattenom nine," received harsh sentences. These included jail time, suspended terms, and an order to pay €50,000 in damages to the energy company EDF. These penalties are notably more severe when compared to those handed down in similar cases in countries like Russia, the UK, and Australia.

An appeal is scheduled for 30 October, where the activists' legal team will argue that their actions were justified by a "state of necessity"—acting to prevent a greater danger. You can show your support for them by following the link or sending a tweet.
