Danicley de Aguiar, a Greenpeace Brazil campaigner, journeyed from Pará, Brazil, to South Korea to bring attention to how illegal gold mining is threatening the Amazon rainforest and Indigenous Peoples, including the Kayapó, Munduruku, and Yanomami.

Over a period of 36 years, mining has led to the destruction of more than 200,000 hectares of land. The use of hydraulic excavators has accelerated this damage within Indigenous Territories. A Greenpeace investigation covering the years 2021 to 2023 found 176 excavators operating illegally in these areas. The investigation revealed that 75 of these machines were from Hyundai's Brazilian subsidiary, having been sold through dealers located near the affected regions.

This illegal activity spreads diseases, causes mercury contamination, and fuels deforestation, which in turn worsens biodiversity loss and the climate crisis. Hyundai should utilize monitoring technology to prevent its equipment from being used for such purposes and to help protect the Amazon.
