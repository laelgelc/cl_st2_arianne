For World Oceans Day, Greenpeace supporters across the globe took part in fun, creative actions, painting themselves blue and performing human waves to advocate for the protection of our oceans.

This wave of support for our planet's blue heart was truly global, with participants in 25 countries across all seven continents. People came together in places from Russia and Senegal to New Zealand and Chile, from Bulgaria and Thailand to the shores of Antarctica. Through these actions, they sent a clear and powerful signal to world leaders about the importance of our oceans.
