The Antarctic is far from a sterile wilderness; it teems with a diversity of marine life. This unique ecosystem is home to whales, orcas, seals, fish, and seabirds, as well as species found nowhere else on the seafloor. As the world's last wild frontier, it is in urgent need of protection.

This vital region faces serious threats. The Antarctic Peninsula is warming rapidly, which affects both sea ice and the krill population that forms the foundation of the entire food web. Alongside this, industrial fishing is depleting fish stocks.

The Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) has the authority to establish protective marine reserves. However, despite a 2009 agreement to create such a network, progress has been slow.

There is now a clear plan for action. A new publication from the Antarctic Ocean Alliance proposes a network of 19 reserves, which would cover over 40% of the Southern Ocean. At the upcoming CCAMLR meeting in October 2012, its members have the opportunity to create this network. This decision could inspire the protection of the high seas globally.
