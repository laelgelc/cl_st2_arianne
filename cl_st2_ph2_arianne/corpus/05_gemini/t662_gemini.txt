A Honduran court has convicted seven men for the 2016 murder of Indigenous activist Berta Cáceres. The group found guilty includes a military official, hired assassins, and employees of the company DESA. Berta was killed for her opposition to the Agua Zarca megadam.

Despite this verdict, the trial faced significant barriers, including a lack of transparency and the exclusion of Berta's family from the proceedings. Her daughter, Laura, has decried this injustice and vowed to continue fighting for true accountability.

Berta’s killing is part of a devastating global pattern. In 2017, 207 environmental defenders were murdered for protecting their land and resources, and many of them were Indigenous women.

We must continue to demand justice and hold the masterminds behind Berta's murder accountable. Environmental defenders everywhere need protection. Please share this to demand #JusticeForBerta.
