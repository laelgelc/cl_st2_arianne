After three years of campaigning, our Southeast Asia tuna ranking reveals a significant shift: five companies now hold Green ratings for their sustainable practices, a major improvement from nearly zero.

However, our report also highlights the vast regional consumption of canned tuna, alongside a troubling lack of consumer awareness about its sourcing. This allows severe threats to our oceans to persist, including unsustainable fishing and the catch of juvenile tuna using Fish Aggregating Devices (FADs) in countries like Indonesia and the Philippines.

We have exposed a deep-seated double standard within the industry, where stricter sustainability measures are applied to products for export markets while those for local consumers are often overlooked.

It is crucial that consumers demand abuse-free tuna. This action is vital to protect our oceans and to ensure full traceability from the sea to your plate.
