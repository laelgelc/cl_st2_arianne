Greenpeace is joining an Indigenous-led movement on Canada's Pacific coast to stop Kinder Morgan's oil pipeline.

Indigenous leaders, including Elder Ta’ah and Will George, are gathering with allies to build a traditional Coast Salish "watch house" over a two-day period. This action is being taken to resist the pipeline's construction.

The pipeline threatens Indigenous lands, water, and communities. It also poses a threat to endangered orcas. By transporting dirty tar sands oil, the pipeline exacerbates climate change. The project is moving forward without full Indigenous consent.

This mobilization is aimed at protecting the ocean, wildlife, and local livelihoods from the expansion of fossil fuels. Greenpeace is calling on people worldwide to join the movement.
