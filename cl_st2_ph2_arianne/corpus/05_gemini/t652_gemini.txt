Amid rising CO2 levels and record emissions, we are facing ongoing climate inaction. The truth is that the peak of conventional oil production is being masked by the rise of unconventional fossil fuels. These sources, including tar sands bitumen, heavy oils, synthetic liquids, deepwater oil, biofuels, and fracked tight oil, are creating a dangerous illusion of abundance.

These unconventional fuels are low-quality, energy-intensive, and environmentally destructive. Their extraction and use cause spills, pollution, and severe health risks. Furthermore, they generate high carbon emissions, directly contributing to the climate crisis.

This entire enterprise is propped up by a fragile financial system, relying on debt and Ponzi-like schemes to continue operating. By pursuing these dirty energy sources, the necessary and urgent transition to renewables is being delayed, a delay that only serves to exacerbate climate change.
