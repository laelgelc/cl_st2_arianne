At COP27, agribusiness companies launched "The Roadmap to 1.5," but these are hollow pledges and an act of greenwashing. The initiative ignores the human rights abuses and labor violations that are part of commodity production.

Past deforestation commitments made by firms such as JBS, Marfrig, Cargill, and Wilmar have already failed. Meanwhile, destruction continues in critical regions like the Amazon, Cerrado, and Great Chaco.

Transformative changes are required. This includes the protection of ecosystems and their restoration, which must be funded by the companies responsible. There must be a reduction in the demand for meat and biofuels, alongside full supply chain transparency. Business with companies engaged in destruction must be suspended, and the rights of Indigenous peoples must be respected. These actions cannot rely on carbon credits.
