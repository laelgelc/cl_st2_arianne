Greenpeace USA has evaluated 17 of the world's major smartphone, tablet, and PC producers. The companies were assessed on three key areas: their transition to renewable energy, their efforts to reduce resource consumption, and the elimination of hazardous chemicals from their products.

The evaluation highlights Apple's leadership in moving towards 100% renewable supply chains. In contrast, Samsung and Huawei are lagging in reporting their emissions. In the area of resource consumption, Fairphone, Dell, and HP are leading with more durable and repairable designs to combat e-waste. However, many companies continue to use hazardous chemicals like PVC and BFRs in their products.

Overall, the average grade for the companies evaluated was a D+. Fairphone was the highest-scoring company with a B.

Based on these findings, we are urging the public to take action by sending tweets to companies such as Samsung, Huawei, and Amazon. We are also sharing facts on the environmental impact of electronics and re-launching the Guide to Greener Electronics.
