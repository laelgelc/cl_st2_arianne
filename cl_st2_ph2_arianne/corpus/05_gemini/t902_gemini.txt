Annet van Aarsen describes the diving beauty of the North Sea, a place of clear waters and vibrant wrecks teeming with life, including anemones, fish, crabs, lobsters, nudibranchs, and tube worms.

Since she began diving in 2001 and had her first North Sea dive in 2002, she has witnessed declines. She has seen cod vanish and an increase in ghost nets, which trap marine life. In 2009, Annet began taking part in volunteer cleanups and documenting the issue for awareness. She joined the Ghost Fishing Foundation in 2012.

Now, she is aboard Greenpeace's Arctic Sunrise ship, where a team of nine divers is actively removing nets from wrecks in the Sylter Aussenriff. This mission showcases the area's fragile ecosystem while highlighting its need for real protection.
