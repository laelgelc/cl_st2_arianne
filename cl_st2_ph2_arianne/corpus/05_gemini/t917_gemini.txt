In March 2016, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) began hearing preliminary oral arguments in the case brought by the Republic of the Marshall Islands against the United Kingdom, India, and Pakistan. These hearings are part of wider lawsuits filed in April 2014 against nine nuclear-armed nations.

The legal action is rooted in the legacy of U.S. nuclear tests conducted in the islands between 1946 and 1958. These tests contaminated the region and resulted in severe radiation impacts on the local population. Tony de Brum shared a harrowing account from 1954, recalling how children mistook the radioactive fallout for snow and ate it.

The Marshall Islands’ case alleges that the nuclear-armed states have breached their obligations under international law to pursue good-faith negotiations for nuclear disarmament. In 1985, Greenpeace’s Rainbow Warrior assisted in the relocation of residents from Rongelap, who were suffering from the effects of the contamination.

A decision from the ICJ is expected in six months. Greenpeace supports the Marshall Islands in this effort.
