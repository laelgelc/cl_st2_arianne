Andreas Randøy, a young Norwegian activist affiliated with Nature and Youth and Greenpeace, is working to curb Norway's oil industry due to climate change impacts like farming disasters. He was inspired by Greta Thunberg and organized school strikes, which were attended by almost 1,000 participants.

These activists initiated a lawsuit against the government concerning oil drilling in the Arctic, arguing it was a violation of constitutional environmental rights. They did not win the first round of the lawsuit but have since appealed the decision.

Norway presents an eco-friendly image, but it is also a major exporter of oil. When faced with arguments about job losses from the oil industry, Andreas points out that alternative options exist. He highlights that young people have a vision for a future centered on renewables and urges for action to be taken for the sake of global justice.
