In South Africa, an ongoing energy crisis marked by load shedding since 2007 is the result of mismanagement, sabotage, and corruption at Eskom. To combat this, Common Power's Community Energy Accelerator (CEA) is training young professionals in solar project design.

Participants in the program, such as Abongile Gogo, Chitola Mufali, Avuziwe Mfeka, Lucy Mofokeng, and Luvuyo Mdepha, highlight the significant benefits of this approach. These include democratized access to energy, the empowerment of communities, and the creation of new jobs. They also point to the development of affordable green solutions and the crucial independence from power outages that have plagued the country.

The program provides skills in business, digital tools, finance, and community engagement. In a pilot collaboration, Greenpeace Africa is working with the initiative to mentor these developers as they create community solar and battery projects.
