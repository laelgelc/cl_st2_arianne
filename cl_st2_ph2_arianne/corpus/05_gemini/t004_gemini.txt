In South Africa, the energy crisis, marked by load shedding since 2007 due to mismanagement, sabotage, and corruption at Eskom, is being challenged by new initiatives. Common Power's Community Energy Accelerator (CEA) is a program that trains young professionals in solar project design.

Participants like Abongile Gogo, Chitola Mufali, Avuziwe Mfeka, Lucy Mofokeng, and Luvuyo Mdepha have pointed to the benefits of this work. They highlight how it democratizes energy access, empowers communities, and creates jobs. Furthermore, it offers independence from power outages and provides affordable green solutions.

The program is set against a backdrop of rising costs and unemployment, which are exacerbated by corruption. It specifically enhances the skills of participants in business, digital tools, finance, and engagement. A pilot project is also underway with Greenpeace Africa, which focuses on training mentors for community solar and battery projects.
