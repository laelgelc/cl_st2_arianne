The auditor Rainforest Alliance has suspended three Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certificates held by Canada's Resolute Forest Products. This action was taken due to the company's failures in obtaining the free and informed consent of First Nations, protecting High Conservation Values, and gaining stakeholder support.

The suspension, which affects 8 million hectares, follows complaints from the Grand Council of the Crees, Greenpeace, and others. These complaints addressed violations occurring in the boreal forests of Quebec and Ontario, which include threats to endangered areas such as the Montagnes Blanches and important caribou habitats.

The FSC was established in 1993 to certify products from responsibly managed forests and build trust with consumers and companies. According to Greenpeace's Grant Rosoman, this suspension boosts the FSC's credibility. The action strengthens the system's enforcement and demonstrates a commitment to rooting out poor certificates.
