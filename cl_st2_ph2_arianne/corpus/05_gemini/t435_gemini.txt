During the COVID-19 pandemic, small-scale fishers in southern Thailand were impacted by closed markets, a drop in seafood prices, and a loss of income. Wichotsak Ronarongpairee, chairman of the Thai Sea Watch Association (TSWA), observed these challenges and launched a fund to provide support.

The initiative allowed for donations of 150 THB, which were used to purchase local seafood from the fishers. This seafood was then distributed to communities, including the blind and medical staff. The fund raised nearly 60,000 THB, which facilitated the delivery of a ton of fish to more than 500 care workers. The recipients expressed their gratitude for the support.

Based on this experience, Ronarongpairee anticipates potential growth in direct online sales from fishers to consumers seeking fresh, traditionally caught seafood. The TSWA is also planning another program aimed at aiding the poor, homeless, and disabled.
