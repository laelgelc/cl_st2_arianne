The Karipuna Indigenous Peoples are fighting to protect their officially recognized Brazilian territory from land-grabbers who are invading for logging and cattle farming. To defend their home, they have spoken at the United Nations, collaborated with organizations to monitor deforestation, and highlighted government inaction.

Now, they are taking legal action by suing the Brazilian state. The lawsuit centers on the government permitting illegal land registrations via the misused CAR registry, a system that enables deforestation and grazing to take place in protected areas. This issue, combined with the lack of a protection plan for their land, resulted in their territory being ranked among the top 10 most destroyed Indigenous territories in Brazil last year.

Deforestation has surged since 2019 under the anti-environmental policies of President Bolsonaro, which threatens Indigenous lives and vital ecosystems. Supporting the rights of the Karipuna is a crucial part of global climate protection.
