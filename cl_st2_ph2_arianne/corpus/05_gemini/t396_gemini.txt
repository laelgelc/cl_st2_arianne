Governments have received their exam results for nature, and it's a fail. Not a single one of the 2010 biodiversity targets was fully achieved, leaving our natural world at a breaking point.

The pressures on nature are being intensified by destructive industries like fossil fuels and industrial agriculture. The result is that only 15% of the world's forests remain intact, and a mere 3% of our oceans are free from human pressures. This is compounded by political pollution from corporations.

Urgent shifts are needed. We must end subsidies for harmful sectors and transform how we produce food. We must create ocean sanctuaries and ensure recovery packages are green and just. This requires accountable national plans with proper funding, alongside public mobilization to protect nature and combat these crises.
