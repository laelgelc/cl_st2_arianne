A Greenpeace report, 'Food Injustice 2020-22', reveals how 20 major agribusiness corporations in the grain, fertiliser, meat, and dairy sectors exploited the COVID-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine. In 2020 and 2021, these companies amassed $53.5 billion in payouts to their shareholders. This amount exceeds the UN's $51.5 billion estimate to provide aid for 230 million of the most vulnerable people.

The report notes that market concentration enables these firms to control supply chains and withhold information, leading to inflated prices and profits. To address this, the post calls for food sovereignty and returning power to small-scale farmers. It also calls for measures like universal basic income, windfall taxes, and dividend taxation to end hunger and promote social justice amid climate crises.
