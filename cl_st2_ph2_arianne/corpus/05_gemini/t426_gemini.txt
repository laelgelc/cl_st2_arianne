One year after the shocking fires in the Amazon, the destruction continues unabated. There is a real risk that 2020 could be even more devastating for the rainforest and for the Indigenous Peoples who call it home.

Recent aerial images captured by Greenpeace Brazil over the state of Mato Grosso reveal that fires are ongoing. This is happening despite a government ban on fires, highlighting how ineffective this measure has been. After more than a million hectares burned last year, this past June saw a record number of fire hotspots.

The policies of President Bolsonaro are dismantling environmental protections, which in turn enables unchecked deforestation to clear land for pastures. This destruction exacerbates the climate crisis and contributes to a devastating loss of biodiversity.

Furthermore, it poses a direct threat to the lives of Indigenous Peoples. This threat is made even worse by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has led to high mortality rates within their communities and is compounded by the respiratory risks associated with smoke from the fires.

In response, pressure is growing from investors and the public. There are demands for stronger laws, proper funding for environmental agencies, and the protection of Indigenous rights. A key demand is for an end to all business with those responsible for destroying the forest.
