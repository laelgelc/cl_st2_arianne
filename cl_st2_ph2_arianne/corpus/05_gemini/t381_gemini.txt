My environmental journey began in 1990 with a Zimbabwean farmer who was facing a drought. Today, my focus is on human-made climate change. Supported by a group of over 2000 Climate Seniors, I have traveled the Rhine to Strasbourg to make an appeal at the European Court of Human Rights. We are inspired by other successful climate lawsuits and hope to set a precedent.

Growing up in Switzerland, I have lamented the melting of glaciers like Pizol. After leaving a career in academia, I began to fund green startups. At the age of 72, I joined the Climate Seniors. In 2016, we challenged Switzerland's climate targets. We faced rejections, even though the Supreme Court acknowledged the problem. This is like ignoring avalanche prevention. We will persist in our efforts.
