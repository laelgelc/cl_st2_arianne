Air pollution from burning fossil fuels increases the risks of strokes, heart disease, lung cancer, and asthma. According to a new study, this contributes to an estimated 4.5 million deaths worldwide every year. This pollution also contributes to the climate emergency.

We must end the sales of new petrol and diesel cars and phase out coal power stations.

On various dates in early 2020, people protested in countries including Thailand, Romania, Bulgaria, Senegal, South Africa, India, Turkey, Cameroon, Indonesia, and Kenya, with images being shared.
