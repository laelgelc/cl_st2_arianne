The car industry is pursuing a dangerous trend of producing increasingly heavier vehicles. This push towards larger cars, particularly SUVs, means they consume more energy and, as a result, emit higher levels of CO2. This problem is not solved by electrification, as heavy electric models require larger, resource-intensive batteries, continuing the cycle of high energy consumption.

A clear example of this trend is the Volkswagen Golf, which has gained significant weight over the decades, resulting in a 57% increase in its emissions. The company's heavier Tiguan model further illustrates this issue. Beyond the environmental impact, these oversized vehicles create significant safety hazards. SUVs pose a greater risk in accidents, especially to pedestrians and other road users. Furthermore, their drivers are noted to be more prone to engaging in risky behaviour.

Faced with this reality, the car industry continues to prioritise profits over its responsibilities under the Paris Agreement. It invests heavily in SUVs, promotes them with extensive advertising, and has seen sales boom as a result.

A sustainable transport future requires a different path. We need a transition to smaller, lighter electric cars, an increase in shared ownership schemes, and a major expansion of public transport. The ultimate goal should be fewer vehicles on our roads. It is this vision that has prompted Greenpeace to take direct action, protesting against the import of oversized SUVs.
