The 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster continues to present risks due to long-lived radionuclides that are still circulating. Recent wildfires, which began on April 3, 2020, are the largest ever recorded within the exclusion zone. These fires have burned 57,000 hectares, equivalent to 22% of the area, and released radioactive particles into the air, including caesium-137, strontium-90, americium-241, and plutonium isotopes.

Smoke from the fires has traveled as far as Kyiv and Norway, leading to increased radiation levels. This has elevated health risks, such as the potential for cancer from inhaling the particles. The fires are exacerbating existing nuclear threats and are placing a significant burden on emergency services, which are simultaneously managing the COVID-19 crisis. This situation also brings attention to ongoing transparency issues, affecting millions of people living in the contaminated regions of Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia.
