In 2015, Greenpeace Mexico's campaign for healthy food showed promise in its aim to foster ecological farming that empowers farmers and respects consumers.

As part of this work, the Esperanza ship's tour enabled scientists to take samples for pesticides and fertilizers in Sinaloa and the Mexican Caribbean. The results of this sampling are expected soon. The campaign also engaged with food companies to push for transparency, an effort backed by 50,000 consumers.

In the Yucatan Peninsula, collaborations were established with Mayan communities, other NGOs, and local governments. These partnerships highlighted traditional milpa systems. This work resulted in a commitment from the governor of Yucatan, who pledged to create a 2018 strategy dedicated to supporting ecological farming. This strategy will be based on diverse crops such as corn, beans, and squash.
