Following global campaigns by Greenpeace, Samsung Electronics has committed to powering its operations in the US, China, and Europe with 100% renewable energy by 2020. This commitment includes its manufacturing factories.

To support this goal, the company plans onsite solar and geothermal installations near its Korean semiconductor plants in Hwaseong, Pyongtaek, and Suwon. In doing so, Samsung is also supporting South Korea's national target of achieving 20% renewable energy by 2030. Furthermore, Samsung will join the CDP supply chain program next year as a measure to address climate risks.

This is a crucial step in the transition away from fossil fuels, as it begins to address the company's massive energy footprint, which in 2016 amounted to 16,000 GWh—equivalent to the annual energy consumption of the Dominican Republic. Greenpeace urges Samsung to follow through on its commitment and to expand this renewable energy goal to other regions, including Vietnam.
