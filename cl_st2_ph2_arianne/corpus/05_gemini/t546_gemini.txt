In Baytown, Texas, twenty-two Greenpeace USA activists have peacefully shut down the busiest oil shipping channel in the country. They have suspended themselves from the Fred Hartman Bridge with the plan to remain for 24 hours to challenge the fossil fuel industry.

This channel is responsible for the movement of over 700,000 barrels of oil every day, a number that could potentially increase to 2 million. Dramatic footage from the action serves to underscore the urgency of the climate crisis.

Activist Irene Kim emphasized that we are in a climate emergency. She urged the need for bold leadership and systemic change, noting that communities are suffering due to the impacts of fossil fuels.

With the Democratic debate taking place in Houston, Greenpeace is calling on the candidates to support a Green New Deal and to reject fossil fuels.
