Dorothy Stowe, a co-founder of Greenpeace, died on July 23, 2010, in Vancouver at the age of 89.

Born in Rhode Island in 1920 to parents who were Jewish immigrants, she went on to study English and philosophy. She worked as a psychiatric social worker and led a union during the McCarthy era. In 1953, she married Irving Stowe, and together they campaigned against nuclear weapons, drawing upon Quaker principles.

After immigrating to New Zealand and then to Canada, they formed the Don't Make a Wave Committee in 1968. This committee led to the 1971 Greenpeace voyage, which pressured the U.S. to end its nuclear tests. The group became Greenpeace in 1972 and is now a global organization.

Dorothy inspired activists worldwide and hosted figures like Bono and Kumi Naidoo. She embodied a lifelong dedication to peace, justice, and ecology.
