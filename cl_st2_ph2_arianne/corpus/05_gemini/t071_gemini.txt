In 2022, a number of notable environmental wins were recorded. The Philippines' Commission on Human Rights declared climate change to be a human rights issue and held corporations accountable for it. To protect advocates, the European Union proposed a law against SLAPPs. The United Nations General Assembly affirmed the right to a healthy environment.

In California, a ban was enacted on new oil and gas wells near communities. The EU also passed a deforestation law that requires supply chain traceability. In Canada, a proposed expansion of an Arctic iron mine was rejected to protect Inuit lands.

Globally, there were calls for a moratorium on deep sea mining, and a United Nations resolution was established to create a plastics treaty. Court victories were also secured in Argentina and South Africa against oil exploration, and in Indonesia for clean air.
