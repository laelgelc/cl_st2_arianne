Nate Hagens, a former Wall Street executive, is now an ecology analyst who founded the Institute for the Study of Energy & Our Future. He hosts podcasts, including The Great Simplification, where he interviews experts about ecological predicaments.

Hagens explains his concept of "The Great Simplification" as an impending reversal of societal complexity. He states this will be driven by a declining surplus of fossil energy, occurring amidst rising debt and environmental limits. He critiques what he calls "energy blindness" and notes the inability of renewables to fully replace fossil fuels. To mitigate future harms, Hagens advocates for local resiliency, a reduction in consumption, and greater ecological awareness.
