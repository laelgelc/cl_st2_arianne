I have seen firsthand how a beautiful landscape like Dumaguete City in the Philippines has been turned into a dumping ground for global plastic pollution. While regions like Southeast Asia are often blamed for the plastic crisis, much of the waste originates from Europe and North America.

A GAIA report, based on waste audits in the Philippines, identifies corporations like Nestlé and Unilever as top sources of the plastic pollution found. Through the global waste trade, corporations are using communities as their dumping grounds.

It is time for these corporations to take responsibility and phase out single-use plastics. We are inspired by local heroes like Froilan Grate and Merci Ferrer, who are leading the way with the #BreakFreeFromPlastic movement.
