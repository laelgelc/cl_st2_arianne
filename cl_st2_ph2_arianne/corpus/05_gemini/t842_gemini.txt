The oceans are the origin of all life on Earth. For the past 60 years, they have absorbed 90% of the excess heat from greenhouse gas emissions, a service that has prevented a catastrophic global warming of 36°C. They provide us with oxygen, food, and regulate our climate, but they are being strained by the pressures of industrial fishing and pollution.

For healthier oceans and a thriving planet, we must urgently create ocean sanctuaries and cut emissions. At United Nations talks, there is a push for a global treaty to protect biodiversity in the high seas. Such a treaty would make it possible to create a network of ocean sanctuaries that would allow marine populations to rebuild and strengthen their resilience.
