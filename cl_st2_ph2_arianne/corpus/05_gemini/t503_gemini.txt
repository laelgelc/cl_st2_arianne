President Jair Bolsonaro's Provisional Presidential Decree (PPD) 910 legalizes public Amazon land that was illegally occupied and deforested between 2008 and 2018. This decree rewards land grabbers with amnesty for their illegal activities.

The PPD extends the regularization of land to occupations that occurred before May 2014, and potentially up to 2018. It also eases the processes for larger properties up to 15 tax modules, an area equivalent to 1,650 soccer fields. This is a false solution that formalizes the practice of land grabbing and encourages further deforestation. The decree harms the environmental balance, the rights of Indigenous peoples, and the public heritage of Brazil.

Instead of such measures, what Brazil needs for proper land management are unified databases and strengthened oversight. We must stand with the forest guardians to protect the Amazon.
