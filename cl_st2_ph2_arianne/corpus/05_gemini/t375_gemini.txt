The deep ocean is a world of ancient coral reefs, underwater mountains, and sea creatures that have lived for centuries, holding clues to the very origins of life. Yet a new industry is now seeking to mine the seabed for corporate profit.

Scientists have issued a stark warning: this could cause irreversible damage to marine life. It could also harm the ocean's vital carbon-storing processes, which would in turn exacerbate the climate crisis. While negotiations for a Global Ocean Treaty are underway, the deep sea mining industry is actively lobbying governments. An area of the seabed equivalent to the size of France and Germany combined has already been opened for exploration.

Greenpeace investigations have uncovered a web of companies based in the Global North that are exposing their sponsoring states in the Global South to significant risks. This reality undermines the claims being made by these corporations.

Activists reject this destructive path and are urging for protection over exploitation. You can watch Ocean Witness to learn more and show your support for a strong Global Ocean Treaty.
