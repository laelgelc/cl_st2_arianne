As Japan hosts the 2020 Olympics and Paralympics, the Fukushima nuclear crisis continues. This situation stands in contrast to Prime Minister Abe's 2013 claim that the situation was under control.

The ongoing disaster presents significant challenges, including the management of over one million tonnes of contaminated water and 880 tonnes of molten nuclear fuel. The crisis also involves widespread environmental contamination, with notable impacts on workers and citizens, raising human rights issues.

An HBO documentary has raised questions about the decision to host the games amid this disaster, as well as about government transparency and safety.

While Greenpeace applauds Olympic values, we urge the International Olympic Committee to ensure environmental sustainability and safety for all involved. Radiation hotspots have been noted in areas of Fukushima designated for Olympic events and the torch relay. Greenpeace will soon announce the results of an upcoming radiation survey.
