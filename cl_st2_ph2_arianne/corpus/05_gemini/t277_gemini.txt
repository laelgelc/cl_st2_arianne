The intensifying climate crisis, outlined in the IPCC report, is being evidenced by recent wildfires, floods, and heatwaves, making the need for urgent action clear. In this context, photography plays a vital role in raising awareness. The goal is not to shock audiences, but to use engaging and honest images that start conversations and evoke emotion.

Photographers are sharing powerful personal narratives to highlight the crisis. These stories include documenting the shrinkage of Lake Urmia, the environmental threats facing Sri Lanka, and the scientific work being undertaken in the Arctic. Such work reflects shifts in media attention and underscores the need for balanced depictions that convey both urgency and hope.

Projects like EverydayClimateChange are expanding this visual storytelling through exhibitions and YouTube. At Greenpeace, we stress the fundamental importance of bearing witness to these events, as it is a critical step in driving the necessary change.
