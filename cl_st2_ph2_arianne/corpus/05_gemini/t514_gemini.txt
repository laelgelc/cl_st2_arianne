Messages from global youth and adults were projected onto Oslo's Parliament and amplified via megaphone, urging Norway to protect future generations by halting Arctic oil drilling and phasing out fossil fuels.

The messages highlighted fears of climate deterioration and the critical need to heed science. They also pointed to Norway's outsized CO2 export footprint, which is ten times its domestic emissions.

This action is part of a wider movement that includes a historic lawsuit filed by Greenpeace Nordic and Nature and Youth against the Norwegian government. The case, which invokes the Paris Agreement and Norway's Constitution, has garnered the support of over 500,000 people and inspired worldwide protests.
