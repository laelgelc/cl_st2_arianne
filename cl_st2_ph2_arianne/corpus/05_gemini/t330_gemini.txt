Thirty-five years after the Chernobyl disaster, governments and companies continue to build new nuclear plants. Projects include a plant in Belarus and Russia's floating "Akademik Lomonosov," which has been dubbed a "floating Chernobyl." Over 30 countries currently operate nuclear plants. To avoid creating new risks, there is a call to phase out nuclear energy and transition to renewables.

Meanwhile, challenges from the original disaster persist. No technology yet exists to manage the reactor's radioactive fuel. A sarcophagus constructed in 2016 only buys time. In contaminated areas of Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia, five million people continue to receive ongoing radiation.

In 2020, climate-driven forest fires in the exclusion zone, the largest yet recorded, created new risks for firefighters. A planned study, supported by Greenpeace, will assess the radiation doses received by firefighters during these events.
