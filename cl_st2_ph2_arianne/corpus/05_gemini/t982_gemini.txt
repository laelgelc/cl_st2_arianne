Uniqlo's parent company, Fast Retailing Group, has committed to eliminating all releases of hazardous chemicals from its global supply chain and products by the year 2020. This move follows similar pledges made by other major brands, including Zara, Mango, Esprit, and Levi’s.

As part of its commitment, Fast Retailing Group will disclose discharge data from 80% of its suppliers in 2013 and will lead the development of alternatives to hazardous chemicals. This pledge covers all of the group's brands, such as Comptoir des Cotonniers and Theory, and will benefit communities that have been affected by pollution.

To keep the pressure on lagging brands like GAP and Calvin Klein, please share the Detox Fashion video and help push them toward transparent, toxic-free practices.
