Zhao Li’s curiosity about the natural world began in her childhood in Beijing, where she would observe cicada nymphs and hens. It was Jane Goodall's story about chimpanzees that inspired her to pursue environmentalism. In 2017, she began an internship at Greenpeace East Asia, eventually becoming a researcher who supports climate campaigns using GIS and satellite analysis.

She highlights the prevalence of public misinformation on climate change and the urgent need for greater awareness. Since 2008, she has witnessed the retreat of glaciers on the Tibetan Plateau. Zhao Li observes that urban life often obscures how much humans rely on nature. This is happening against a backdrop of deforestation, habitat loss, and the degradation of the Amazon to the point where it is turning into a carbon emitter. While facing despair, she draws hope from Jane Goodall's example to keep taking action.
