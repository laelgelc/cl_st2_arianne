A rotten meat scandal in Brazil has exposed how major companies like JBS and BRF were involved in bribing inspectors. These inspectors were paid to certify meat that was unsafe for people to eat. Police uncovered practices such as using chemicals to mask the smell of rot, adding pigs' heads to sausages, and mixing cardboard into poultry. In response, major importers including China and the European Union banned meat from the country.

This scandal is not an isolated event but highlights systemic issues in global industrial meat production. The industrial meat system is linked to the spread of diseases and causes significant environmental harm. It is a major driver of deforestation and is responsible for 14% of all greenhouse gas emissions.

As part of our campaign for better meat, Greenpeace advocates for a shift towards plant-rich diets and consuming less meat. We must also hold our governments accountable. We support a move towards better meat from local, sustainable sources. An update on the situation noted that companies have been buying cattle from lands that were illegally deforested.
