Under President Bolsonaro's three-year anti-environmental agenda, Brazil has faced devastating consequences. Deforestation in the Amazon has surged by 52.9%, while fires have ravaged the Cerrado and Pantanal biomes. In 2020 alone, the Pantanal lost a third of its area to these fires. This destruction has contributed to a 10% increase in Brazil's greenhouse gas emissions, positioning the country as the world's fifth-highest emitter.

This environmental crisis has been enabled by the deliberate weakening of key protective agencies. The budgets for IBAMA and ICMBio have been slashed by 30% and 32.7% respectively, and their staff has been reduced by 10%. This dismantling of environmental enforcement has fostered a climate of impunity, leading to increased violence against Indigenous peoples and environmental activists. The year 2021 saw 20 such killings, while 2020 was marked by 1,576 land conflicts.

The administration’s policies have also included the approval of over 1,500 new pesticides, many of which are banned in the European Union. These actions have occurred alongside Bolsonaro's verbal attacks on non-governmental organizations and his poor management of both the COVID-19 pandemic and the national economy. Given this record of environmental and social harm, it is imperative to prevent his reelection.
