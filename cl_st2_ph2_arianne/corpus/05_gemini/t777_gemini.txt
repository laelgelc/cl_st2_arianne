With the launch of the S9 smartphone, Samsung is falling behind rivals like Apple, Google, and Facebook. These companies have all committed to 100% renewable energy and are making progress toward that goal.

Currently, Samsung uses only 1% renewable energy. This is a significant problem because 80% of a gadget's carbon emissions happen during manufacturing, which is largely powered by fossil fuels like coal and gas. The scale of this energy consumption is vast; the electricity used for smartphone production between 2007 and 2017 is equivalent to Japan's annual electricity consumption.

Last year, 1.53 billion smartphones were sold, leading to a massive waste of resources and a growing e-waste crisis.

Customers are ready for a change. A 2015 study showed that 66% of customers are willing to pay more for products from sustainable brands. In a recent Greenpeace survey, 85% of over 8,000 supporters said they would be more likely to buy Samsung products if the company was a leader in sustainability.

It's time to tell Samsung to switch to renewables. Post a comment on Samsung’s Facebook page and demand they commit to 100% renewable energy.
