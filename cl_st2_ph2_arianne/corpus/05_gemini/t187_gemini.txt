In the waters of northern Denmark, Olga Lupilina, a Russian activist with Greenpeace Nordic – Denmark, is protesting against Russian oil and fossil fuels. She is blocking the tanker Seaoath, which is carrying 100,000 tonnes of oil worth $65 million from Primorsk.

The EU's daily purchases of Russian oil and gas fund the military amid the Ukraine invasion, a fact that is personal for her. Activists have been tracking and protesting these tankers since the war began.

Lupilina urges that the solution is not to switch to other fossil fuels, but to transition to renewables. She states this is necessary for peace, equity, and to avoid geopolitical struggles. Having traveled 26 hours by train from Slovakia to join the protest, she calls on politicians to halt Russian imports and accelerate a just green shift for global benefit.
