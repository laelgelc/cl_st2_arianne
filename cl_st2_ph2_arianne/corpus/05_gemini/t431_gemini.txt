A major oil spill at Russia's Nornickel plant in Taimyr, Siberia, has polluted land and water. The disaster turned the Ambarnaya River red and its scale rivals past environmental disasters.

According to Grigory Dyukarev, an indigenous leader, Nornickel has a history of pollution and social irresponsibility, which includes abandoning a new settlement. He describes the spill's effects on fishing, hunting, and local economies as devastating.

Dyukarev also notes the impacts of climate change in the region, such as warmer winters, thawing soil, and changing wildlife patterns. He is calling for a support program for the community, comprehensive environmental monitoring, restoration of the damaged ecosystem, and compensation. Furthermore, he is demanding stricter legislation to protect the Arctic.

This event highlights the issue of ongoing spills in remote areas, which disproportionately affect indigenous communities.
