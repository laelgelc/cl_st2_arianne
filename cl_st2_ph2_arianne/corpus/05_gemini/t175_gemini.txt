Leading climate scientists have issued a stark warning in an IPCC report: it is "now or never" to limit global warming to 1.5°C as agreed under the Paris Agreement. In response, governments have approved new oil and gas projects, ignoring the science that shows these are excessive.

This has prompted over 1,000 scientists in 25 countries to protest, with actions in the UK taking place against new licensing. Thirty years have passed since the UN Climate Agreement, yet global emissions have still not peaked. To meet climate goals, emissions must start declining now to peak by 2025.

The report confirms that we have the tools available to halve emissions within eight years. Many of these solutions come at low or even negative costs. This is driven by affordable solar and wind energy, which are now outcompeting fossil fuels. It is time to act on the science. Share the video.
