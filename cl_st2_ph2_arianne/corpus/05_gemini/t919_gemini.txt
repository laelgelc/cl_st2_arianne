In 2015, a movement of seven million people helped halt Shell's plans for Arctic expansion. This was followed by the Paris climate agreement, which signaled a global shift away from fossil fuels and towards a future of sustainability and environmental protection.

The Arctic, however, is warming at twice the rate of the rest of the planet. This January saw a record low for sea ice. As the ice melts, it is enabling destructive industrial activity. In the Barents Sea, trawlers are moving into previously inaccessible areas, risking habitats, causing bycatch, and damaging fragile ecosystems. In Norway’s offshore areas, 30-50% of coral reefs have already been damaged by trawling.

Greenpeace investigations at the North Atlantic Seafood Forum have exposed the companies involved. Trawling companies like Havfisk ASA, Ocean Trawlers, and FIUN are supplying processors including Espersen, High Liner Foods, and Findus. This activity risks tainting the supply chains of retailers with Arctic destruction.
