In April 2021, the Japanese government decided it would discharge radioactive water from the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station into the Pacific Ocean. The plan involves TEPCO diluting the water and releasing it through an undersea pipeline.

A Greenpeace survey from November 2021 included an interview with local fisherman Mr. Haruo Ono, who expressed deep pain regarding the plan's impact on Fukushima's fishing industry. He cited a decade of dishonesty, broken promises, and a betrayal of trust from both the government and TEPCO.

Mr. Ono pointed out that water continues to accumulate at the site and that there is potential for more storage. He raised concerns about long-term radiation risks, such as the accumulation of tritium and carbon-14, and the threats posed to livelihoods, future generations, and the ocean's ecosystem. He urged the authorities to listen to the residents who are affected by this decision.
