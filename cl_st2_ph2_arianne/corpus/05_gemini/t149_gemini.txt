Fossil fuel companies are polluting our cultural spaces. Through ads and sponsorships, they are infiltrating everything from sports and music festivals to the arts and museums. This strategy misleads consumers and blocks climate action, all while ignoring clear scientific warnings about the climate crisis.

Because many of these oil giants are headquartered in Europe, European activists have a specific responsibility to challenge them. We must fight their greenwashing and amplify the voices of vulnerable frontline communities who are most impacted.

Grassroots groups are now urging for a #BanFossilAds. Activists such as Mattina, Noëlie, Teresa, and Talissa highlight how these sponsorships are a calculated distraction. They are used to divert public attention from the industry's ongoing pollution, its intense political lobbying, and its exploitation of people and resources. These activists are calling for the radical change we need to protect both people and the planet.
