Over half of the world's population lives in cities, a figure projected to reach 70% by 2050. In these urban centers, cars create noise, smell, and consume vast amounts of space. They also present serious health risks, with air pollution responsible for 4.2 million deaths annually, and contribute to climate harm.

A Greenpeace report warns that there are only ten years left to phase out fossil fuel vehicles. We need to advocate for cities that prioritize people over cars. The vision is for urban spaces that are clean, connected, and focused on community.

The benefits are significant. A car-free day in Paris in 2015, for instance, led to a 40% reduction in nitrogen dioxide and cut noise levels by half. Reimagining our cities means creating more green spaces and building infrastructure for active transport. It requires investment in public transit powered by renewable energy and in electric car sharing programs, all of which can help cool urban areas.
