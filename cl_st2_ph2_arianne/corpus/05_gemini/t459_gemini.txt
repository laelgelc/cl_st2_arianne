During a quarantine, our primary responsibility is to stay home to protect vulnerable communities, including Indigenous ones. However, our climate activism does not have to stop. We can begin by engaging our families in discussions around the dinner table about local climate issues. This is also a time to build connections with advocacy groups and stay informed by reading books, watching documentaries, and attending webinars. Participating in online forums can also keep the conversation going.

Our activism can be brought into the digital world. We can create Instagram filters, organize Twitter storms, and develop TikTok content as methods for sharing accurate news.

This period also offers a chance to review our personal habits. We can reduce our meat consumption, noting that livestock is responsible for 14.5% of emissions, and experiment with plant-based recipes. We can work to minimize our reliance on single-use plastics, prioritize reusing items, and ensure we are recycling properly. Growing our own food and preventing waste are further actions we can take. These efforts are acts of solidarity and have a tangible impact.
