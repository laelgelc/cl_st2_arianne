The Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) has disassociated from the Swiss-German timber group Danzer, revoking all of the company's FSC certificates worldwide. This action comes as a result of human rights violations in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).

The decision follows a complaint Greenpeace filed in 2011 against Danzer's subsidiary, Siforco. The complaint concerned events in Yalisika, where the company was involved in illegal logging and called in police and military to suppress community protests. This intervention resulted in injuries, the destruction of property, allegations of rape, and one death.

Greenpeace welcomes the FSC's decision, as it sends a signal against unacceptable practices. While this move may not rectify the past harms inflicted upon the community, it highlights the ongoing violent conflicts linked to logging in the DRC. This case also shows the need to strengthen the FSC, especially in high-risk areas.
