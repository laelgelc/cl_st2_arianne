In 2021, extreme weather events have been seen across the globe, with floods impacting Europe, New York, central China, and Uganda. Canada and Morocco have experienced heatwaves, Japan has suffered from mudslides, and India has faced cloud bursts.

Climate change is accelerating, and this is increasing the vulnerability of our cities. There is a need for early warning systems and coordinated responses to these events, but what is truly required is bold action to halt the crisis. The blame lies with extractive industries like fossil fuels and industrial agriculture. These sectors are characterized by their colonial business models, their use of greenwashing, and their resistance to making necessary emission cuts.

With 100 days to go until COP26, we are urging world leaders to take the action needed to cap global temperatures at 1.5ºC.
