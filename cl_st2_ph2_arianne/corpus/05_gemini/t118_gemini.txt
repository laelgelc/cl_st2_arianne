Europe's transport system is dependent on fossil fuels, a reality that exacerbates multiple crises. This dependency worsens climate change, inflation, and energy price hikes, while also funding wars through oil exports, such as Russia's.

For households, this system brings high costs. Transport is responsible for 30% of the EU's greenhouse gas emissions. Furthermore, environmental damage is caused not only by oil extraction but also by false solutions like agrofuels.

The solution is to drain oil from our mobility. This involves a shift towards affordable public and active transport. The transport sector must be decarbonized by 2040, and inefficient alternatives must be avoided. To ensure this is a fair transition, subsidies for polluters must end, and workers must be supported.
