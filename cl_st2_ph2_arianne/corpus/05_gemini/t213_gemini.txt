As we reflect on the 50th anniversary of Greenpeace, and with the anniversary of the landmark Limits to Growth study on the horizon, we are reminded that a new ecological awareness began to emerge in the 1970s. This awakening was born from the first clear signs of a planet in crisis.

In the decades that followed, environmental movements grew, new legislation was passed, and global conferences were held. Despite these efforts, human society has failed to achieve sustainability. The results are clear and devastating. Biodiversity has plummeted, with staggering declines in wildlife biomass, insect populations, and marine species. Our forests have continued to shrink. At the same time, the human population has doubled, and so have our emissions.

The root cause of these interconnected crises is not just climate change; that is a symptom of a larger meta-problem. The fundamental issue is overshoot—the fact that humanity is exceeding Earth's regenerative capacity. To truly address the challenges we face, we must move beyond superficial solutions and embrace a deeper ecological understanding of our predicament.
