In a new documentary film, Kristian Sloth, a former journalist and Agricultural Campaigner for Greenpeace Denmark, shares the stories of Danes living in close proximity to industrial pig factories.

Neighbors of these facilities describe a life-ruining stench that makes them feel ashamed when they have visitors and prevents them from hanging laundry outside. They also report green algae growing on their homes, a result of ammonia emissions. The impact extends to their health, with residents experiencing headaches, stomach aches, diarrhea, and breathing difficulties. These health issues are linked to the more than 200 different chemicals, including ammonia and methane, that are emitted from the factories and have been connected to respiratory diseases. Scientific studies confirm that living near these facilities brings elevated risks for conditions such as asthma and skin issues.

For those who bought their homes before the factories were built, their properties have become unsellable. This is a significant issue in Denmark, a country with over 3,000 industrial pig factories and the highest number of pigs per capita in the world, reflecting a problem that is global in scale.
