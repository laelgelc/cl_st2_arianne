In the remote Indian Ocean lies the Saya de Malha Bank, a vast underwater plateau the size of Belgium. It is home to the world's largest seagrass meadow, as well as shallow corals and an abundance of marine life. Endangered turtles, sperm whales, and even pygmy blue whales can be found in these waters.

Seagrass meadows are vital ecosystems; they capture significant amounts of CO2 and serve as crucial nurseries for marine life. Globally, however, these habitats are declining due to human activity. The Saya de Malha Bank is facing threats from industrial fishing. Vessels from the EU are using destructive methods like purse seine nets and longlines, leading to the overfishing of yellowfin tuna. This activity also results in the bycatch of non-target species, including turtles, whales, and sharks.

A strong Global Ocean Treaty is needed to create sanctuaries in international waters, protecting these unique and vulnerable areas from destructive industries. We urge you to sign the petition to help safeguard our oceans.
