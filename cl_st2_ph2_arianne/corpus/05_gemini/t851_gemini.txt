For Captain Mike Fincken, a sailor with three decades of experience, the oceans are his home. He has witnessed their decline firsthand, watching as overfishing, poor management, and illegal activities have taken their toll in West Africa. Aboard the Greenpeace ship Esperanza, he and his crew are now sailing these waters for two and a half months. Their mission is to document the impacts of overfishing on fish stocks, food security, and the local communities.

This work is informed by his past experiences, which include chasing pirate vessels and witnessing infractions by a Chinese fleet. He has assisted in arrests and observed the operations of destructive European "Monster boats." Based on everything he has seen, Captain Fincken calls for urgent regional fisheries management to promote sustainability and end the ongoing exploitation of West Africa's waters.
