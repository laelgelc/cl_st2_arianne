An overflight conducted by Greenpeace Argentina has revealed illegal deforestation in the province of Chaco. Despite a provincial suspension on clearing activities, a total of 10,329 hectares were cleared between November 2020 and July 2021. During the overflight, bulldozers were observed actively operating in at least 10 different locations.

The Gran Chaco is the second-largest forest in South America. It is home to a diverse range of species and supports a population of 4 million people. This includes Indigenous communities such as the Wichi and Qom, who rely on the forest for their sustenance.

This deforestation is driven by the expansion of agriculture and livestock for export markets. The consequences include the exacerbation of climate change, an increase in droughts and storms, the destruction of biodiversity, and the loss of livelihoods for Indigenous peoples.

To address this, the enforcement of existing forest laws is urged. Collaboration with the expertise of Indigenous communities is also called for to halt the clearing of these forests and to promote their restoration.
