Amid global extreme weather, the efforts of Greenpeace supporters have helped secure a hopeful step forward. In June, Samsung announced its initial plans to begin shifting its production lines from fossil fuels to renewable energy. This move aligns with South Korea's national transition away from both nuclear and fossil fuels.

Leading up to this, Greenpeace East Asia sent a report to Samsung's leadership outlining specific actions the company could take. The report detailed how to power its factories in China, the US, and Europe with renewables. We continue to urge Samsung to expand these renewable energy commitments to its facilities in South Korea and Vietnam.

Other major companies are also making progress. Facebook has committed to powering its global operations with 100% renewable energy by 2020. Greenpeace will continue its work to push more companies to make the vital switch to renewables.
