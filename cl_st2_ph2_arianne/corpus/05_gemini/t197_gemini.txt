To combat the erosion of our planet, we must recognize the interconnectedness of all things. Feminist leaders from the global South are advocating for a necessary economic transformation, one that prioritizes care work, social reproduction, and resilience for all life.

Their calls demand that we value the invisible contributions of women and shift from extractive to reparative economies. This transformation requires an end to austerity and a reform of tax and debt systems. It also means embracing Indigenous solutions like the commons and degrowth.

Indigenous voices stress the need to protect nature as our home. They remind us that interconnected problems demand interconnected solutions—solutions centered on care and respect.
