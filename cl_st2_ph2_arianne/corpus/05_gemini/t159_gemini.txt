Activists have disrupted the African Energy Summit in London, highlighting the issue of neo-colonial oil extraction in Africa which serves to exacerbate poverty in formerly colonized nations.

Attention is centered on the Canadian firm ReconAfrica and its planned drilling operations in the Kavango region of Namibia and Botswana. This area includes the Okavango Delta. The project risks generating massive CO2 emissions, an amount equivalent to one-sixth of the global carbon budget, which would breach the goals set by the Paris Agreement.

The planned drilling threatens the region’s biodiversity, including endangered species like cheetahs and rhinos. It also poses a risk to local water supplies, tourism, and the livelihoods of Indigenous San communities.

Youth and Indigenous activists, such as Ina-Marie Shikongo and Q7 Beckett, are demanding a halt to the project. They cite a lack of consultation with local people and the potential for devastating consequences.
