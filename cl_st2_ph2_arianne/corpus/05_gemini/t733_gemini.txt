June 1 marks the anniversary of a serious miscalculation. When the Trump administration announced the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris Climate Agreement, it chose to isolate America from the global consensus on climate action.

But that decision did not stop the world. In fact, it has been contrasted by a growing movement for change. Driven by climate activism, New Zealand has banned all new offshore oil and gas exploration. This is just one example of a powerful global movement. In Johannesburg, communities are crowdfunding solar power. People are standing in opposition to new pipelines and coal plants. Major banks and even Norway's sovereign wealth fund are divesting from fossil fuels, and the demands for climate justice are growing.

In the face of the U.S. exit, the global commitment has held firm. Nearly 200 countries have reaffirmed their commitments to the Paris Agreement. Beyond national governments, non-state actors like cities are pledging to transition to 100% renewable energy, and the World Bank has committed to ending its financing for oil and gas.

This is the movement of our time. As the Global Climate Action Summit approaches, it is time to join in and demand bold clean energy transitions.
