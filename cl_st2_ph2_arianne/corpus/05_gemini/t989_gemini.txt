Drilling for oil in the Arctic is an extremely dangerous proposition. The harsh environment makes any operation risky, and the potential consequences of a spill are catastrophic. This pursuit is also incompatible with climate goals, especially in such a fragile region.

The challenges of operating in the Arctic mean that a prolonged oil spill is a very real possibility. Short drilling seasons make it difficult to drill a relief well in time to stop a blowout. Furthermore, recovering oil from ice is impossible, and the response capacity for any accident is inadequate, with too few ships available to help. In the cold Arctic conditions, oil breaks down very slowly, meaning the damage from a spill would persist for a long time.

This presents a grave threat to the region's vulnerable wildlife. Birds, whales, seals, polar bears, and foxes would all be at risk.

Beyond the environmental dangers, the economic case is weak. The costs are incredibly high, as demonstrated by Cairn Energy's billion-dollar failures in its own drilling attempts. This massive financial risk is being taken for a limited reward; the potential supply from the Arctic is equivalent to just three years of global demand. This gamble is also unnecessary. We could achieve significant fuel savings through more fuel-efficient vehicles, if laws promoting them were not blocked. The immense risks of Arctic oil drilling are simply not justified.
