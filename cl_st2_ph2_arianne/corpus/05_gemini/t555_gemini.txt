We are in a climate emergency, with CO2 emissions continuing to rise. The transport sector is responsible for a quarter of these emissions, and road transport makes up 74% of that.

This is why we are calling for protests at the Frankfurt Motor Show. We must demand that automakers embrace cleaner options, such as affordable public transport, safe routes for walking and cycling, and shared electric vehicles that run on renewable energy.

For too long, the car industry has addicted the world to polluting diesel and petrol cars, especially SUVs, often while using green marketing. To avert catastrophe, we must phase out the internal combustion engine. When your house is flooding, the first thing you do is turn off the tap.
