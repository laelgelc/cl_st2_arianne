In 1995, community resistance began in Prachuab Khiri Khan (PKK), Thailand, against proposed coal-fired power plants. Locals were concerned about environmental impacts, a lack of transparency in Environmental Impact Assessments, and illegal land acquisition. They used non-violent tactics to oppose the projects, including protests, billboards, and signs.

Greenpeace Thailand supported the movement, and in 2000, the Rainbow Warrior visited the area. In 2004, the movement’s leader, Charoen Wataksorn, was assassinated. Following this, protests intensified, which led to the government's cancellation of the plants.

Today, PKK remains coal-free. Its economy thrives on fishing, farming, and tourism. The community's resistance continues to inspire ongoing activism.
