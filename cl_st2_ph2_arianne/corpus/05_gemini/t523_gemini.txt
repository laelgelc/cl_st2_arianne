The Gaia hypothesis portrays our Earth as a self-regulating living system. This concept finds its roots not only in Greek mythology but also in Indigenous concepts like Mitákuye Oyás’in. The scientific ideas that form its foundation draw from a range of thinkers, including Howard Odum, Gregory Bateson, Erwin Schrödinger, Herman Daly, Rachel Carson, Ilya Prigogine, Lynn Margulis, and James Lovelock.

The hypothesis explores how life co-evolves with the planet, creating a system that metabolizes waste and maintains a balanced atmosphere. Evolutionary history provides examples of this self-regulation, such as the ancient oxygen crises.

James Lovelock's works, including *Gaia*, *Ages of Gaia*, *The Revenge of Gaia*, and others, have been instrumental in developing this idea. His writings specifically highlight the profound impacts of human activity on biodiversity and the climate. In response to these challenges, Lovelock has advocated for several measures to achieve sustainability, including implementing limits to growth, utilizing nuclear power, addressing population control, and pursuing adaptation strategies.
