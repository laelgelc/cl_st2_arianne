Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Acampamento Terra Livre, known as the world's largest Indigenous gathering held in Brasília, was canceled. Indigenous Peoples from across Brazil are demanding that the government protect their rights and their lands.

Despite practicing isolation, these communities face significant risks from the virus, which is being brought into their territories by illegal invaders such as miners and loggers. Ten deaths have already been reported, including that of a Yanomami boy, a tragedy that echoes the historical devastation of Indigenous communities by diseases.

The pandemic is not the only threat. Communities are also facing Amazon fires, which cause severe respiratory issues, and mercury contamination from mining activities. Under the Bolsonaro administration, funding for FUNAI has been cut, and government policies have led to a doubling of deforestation alerts. This has heightened the destruction of forests within Indigenous territories, which in turn endangers lives, the Amazon, and the global climate. The current pandemic exposes these systemic vulnerabilities and underscores the need for governments to prioritize the well-being of people and the planet.
