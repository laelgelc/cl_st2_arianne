The IPCC report highlights that the climate crisis is an oceans crisis. Healthy oceans are vital for providing food, regulating our climate, and storing carbon. CO2 emissions are causing warming, ice melt, and sea level rise, as well as ocean acidification that harms ecosystems like coral reefs. These impacts are made worse by overfishing, drilling, and plastic pollution.

Governments must prioritize the ongoing UN negotiations to deliver a strong Global Ocean Treaty. This treaty is needed to create a network of sanctuaries that would protect 30% of our oceans by 2030, which will aid in marine recovery. Leaders should also accelerate the shift to renewable energy, end deforestation, and cut emissions to zero. You can join the nearly two million people who are calling for action.
