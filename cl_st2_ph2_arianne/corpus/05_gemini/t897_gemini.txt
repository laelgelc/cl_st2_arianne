Collective action has proven its power. In the past, eight million people came together and forced Shell to abandon its plans for Arctic oil. Now, a new challenge requires our urgent attention.

A decision is imminent to protect 226,150 km² of international Arctic waters. This area, representing 10% of the Arctic, could be safeguarded through the OSPAR commission at a meeting starting in just 18 days, on June 20 in Tenerife, Spain.

As climate change exposes the Arctic, this least-protected ocean is facing increasing threats from oil and fishing. Despite OSPAR having the authority to act, the process is being blocked by Denmark, Norway, and Iceland.

Because the Arctic has a global impact, we need voices to rise up and demand its protection. What are your reasons for safeguarding this vital part of our world?
