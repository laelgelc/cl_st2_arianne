In Brazil, the Serra Ricardo Franco State Park is a vital sanctuary where three unique biomes—the Amazon, Cerrado, and Pantanal—converge. It is home to precious species like the caboclinho-do-sertão bird and the giant otter. Despite its creation as a protected area in 1997, 24% of the park has already been deforested.

This destruction is driven by the creation of cattle pastures. The supply chain is traceable: farms within the park, such as Paredão, sell cows to intermediary farms like Barra Mansa. Barra Mansa then supplies major slaughterhouses, including JBS, Minerva, and Marfrig. These companies export meat globally, yet they are failing to uphold commitments made in 2009 to monitor their suppliers and exclude farms linked to deforestation.

This situation is part of a wider trend of rising deforestation in the Amazon. It also increases the risk of zoonotic diseases, a critical concern highlighted by the COVID-19 pandemic. There is a clear need for enforced protections for the park and for comprehensive reforms within corporate supply chains.
