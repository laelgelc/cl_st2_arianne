The IPCC WGII report powerfully validates the experiences of frontline communities and the importance of Indigenous knowledge. It marks a significant step by emphasizing justice in climate action. The report directly addresses how vulnerabilities are created by inequities such as colonialism and highlights the intersectional nature of climate impacts on marginalized groups.

In response, it calls for human rights-based approaches to adaptation. This focus on justice and historical context provides crucial support for climate litigation efforts. By centering diverse forms of knowledge and the historical roots of the crisis, the report strengthens demands for accountability from both governments and corporations. It is an urgent call for swift action, urging a shift away from denial and toward responses that are fundamentally focused on justice.
