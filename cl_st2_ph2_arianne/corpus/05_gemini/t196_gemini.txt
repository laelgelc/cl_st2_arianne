Amid the fastest-growing refugee crisis since World War II, Greenpeace organizations in neighboring countries such as Slovakia and Romania are actively supporting Ukrainian refugees. They are providing essential supplies, tents, food, and aid.

This war is linked to a dependence on fossil fuels, and a transition to renewables is urged for the sake of peace and sustainability. In response, activists have engaged in non-violent actions to protest Russian oil and gas imports in countries including Germany, Spain, and France. These efforts are part of a wider movement of global peaceful protests opposing the invasion.

Such actions align with Greenpeace's 50-year history of fusing the principles of peace and ecology to stand against war and militarism.
