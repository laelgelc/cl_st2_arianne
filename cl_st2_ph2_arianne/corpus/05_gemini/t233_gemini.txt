Fikile Ntshangase, Berta Cáceres, Marielle Franco, and Nora Apique were environmental defenders who fought for justice and were murdered for their work. Their cases highlight a rising trend of violence against women, girls, and gender minorities engaged in environmental resistance, a phenomenon linked to sexism and patriarchal systems.

The danger faced by defenders is severe. According to a report from Global Witness, 227 environmental defenders were assassinated in 2020. Of these, one-third of the attacks targeted Indigenous people, and the rate of impunity for these murders stands at 95%.

While 90% of the victims are male, violence against female defenders is increasing and includes tactics such as rape and extortion. This escalation of violence is occurring as the impacts of the climate crisis are already affecting 85% of the global population. The intertwined nature of gender-based violence and environmental destruction requires an ecofeminist revolution. We must call for accountability from the Global North and demand protection for those on the frontlines.
