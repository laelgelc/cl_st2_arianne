The unique Kurgalsky Nature Reserve in North-West Russia is under threat. This reserve is home to rare species, including the Baltic ringed seal, black-throated loon, ruddy turnstone, garden dormouse, peregrine falcon, and golden eagle. A white-tailed sea-eagle nest was also recently discovered there.

Gazprom plans to build the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline right through this protected area. The project would cut a 3.7 km scar through old-growth forests, causing damage that would be irreversible.

People are fighting back. Over 38,000 Russians have sent letters to the Ministry of Natural Resources to voice their opposition. Greenpeace Russia has also filed a lawsuit with the Supreme Court to challenge the pipeline.

As the world shifts towards renewables, action must be taken to prevent this fossil fuel project.
