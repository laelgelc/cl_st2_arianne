Greenpeace campaigner Asti Roesle has expressed alarm over the Forest Stewardship Council's (FSC) decision to re-associate with the timber group Danzer. The company was previously disassociated in 2013 for its involvement in human rights violations in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

Roesle criticizes the process for re-association as having been insufficiently rigorous. She points to early violations during the process and the failure to implement Free Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC), which was a recommendation from the Forest Peoples Programme.

While acknowledging that there have been some community benefits, Roesle argues that it is too soon for Danzer to be re-associated with the FSC. She urges the FSC to prioritize environmental and social issues over business interests. Roesle also calls for the FSC to improve its standards in high-risk areas and to propose strong measures at its General Assembly in September.
