A coalition including Nature & Youth and Greenpeace Nordic has filed a legal case against the Norwegian government. The objective is to halt Arctic oil exploration by Statoil. The lawsuit, led by Ingrid Skjoldvær and Truls Gulowsen, is based on Article 112 of Norway's Constitution, which guarantees the right to a healthy environment for future generations.

The legal challenge also demands that the government adheres to the 1.5-degree warming limit set by the Paris Agreement. It points out the contradiction of Norway making emission reduction promises while planning for new drilling in the Barents Sea. To avert a climate catastrophe, 80% of fossil fuels must be kept underground. This people-powered action is intended to protect the Arctic and inspire global resistance against fossil fuels.
