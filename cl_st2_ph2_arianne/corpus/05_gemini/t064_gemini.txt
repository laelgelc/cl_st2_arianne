In a three-part animated series from Green Future, Greenpeace's climate education project, teenagers Sunny and Ho journey through the world of 2100. They witness a reality where climate change has eroded natural wonders.

Their adventures include a visit to "The Last Tree" exhibition, which features rare butterflies, flowers, and fruits. The pair also explore a flooded underwater city while following sea otters. At a restaurant, Sunny and Ho reject meat, envisioning the land devastation caused by industrial farming.

However, the series also depicts a hopeful future. It shows cities powered by solar and wind, and a world with plant-based choices. The series ultimately urges action to secure a better path for the planet and for the generations ahead.
