Greenpeace Japan is urging families to make the switch to organic food. This change can reduce exposure to synthetic pesticides and help fix our broken food system. The power of consumer demand can improve both the availability and affordability of organic options.

A study demonstrated the direct impact of diet on pesticide levels. It involved two families with children who ate a 100% organic diet for 10 days. After this period, urine tests revealed significant decreases in the levels of pesticides in their bodies. The study also found that children had higher initial pesticide levels. This is a particular concern as children are more vulnerable; their organs are still developing, and they receive higher doses of pesticides relative to their body weight.

For a life that is truly free from pesticides, the recommendation is to embrace "eco food." This approach to eating involves food that is locally grown, seasonal, and nutritious. Furthermore, it promotes biodiversity and ensures that farmers receive fair pay.
