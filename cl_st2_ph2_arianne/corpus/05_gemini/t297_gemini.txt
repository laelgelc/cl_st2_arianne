Reflecting on Greenpeace's 50th anniversary through virtual mailbag calls has brought forward many stories. One such story is the 1981 "test blockade" of an oil tanker, an action that successfully prevented the construction of an oil port.

This history inspires a call for continued creative activism. We should consider actions like boycotting ineffective climate conferences and painting the lines of future sea-level rise on city buildings. The challenges we face are immense; pandemics are linked to the ecological overshoot that results from human growth and consumption. This reality urges the environmental movement to address the systemic issues of population, capitalism, and the need for contraction.

In these times, hope can be found by reconnecting with nature. As we discuss Greenpeace's evolution and share personal experiences, it becomes clear that creativity is essential for any movement that aims to endure.
