Reuse and refill systems are longstanding traditions in many countries, predating the recent surge in single-use plastics. This shift has been driven by corporate greed from brands like Nestlé, Unilever, Coca-Cola, and PepsiCo since the 1960s. We must hold corporations accountable to shift toward reuse, emphasizing that systemic change is needed alongside individual actions.

Countries in the Global South are leading the way with innovative models. India has its Dabbawalla and thali systems, while several African nations have implemented bans on single-use items. In Chile, there are mandates for refillable bottles, and Brazil has successful returnable systems. The Philippines showcases a Zero Waste movement with its Wala-Usik stores. These efforts are part of a reuse revolution, and a database of such initiatives exists.
