Awa Traore reflects on COP26 with mixed feelings, pointing to the profit-driven corporations and leaders who are destroying ecosystems and threatening Indigenous lands. She calls on the Global North to acknowledge the role of exploitative capitalism in the climate crisis, while highlighting that the Global South prioritizes people over carbon offsets.

COP26 failed on its key objectives. It did not secure a path to limit warming to 1.5C, failed to deliver the promised $100 billion in climate finance, and did not establish a fund for loss and damage. Instead, the summit promoted unfair carbon trading systems that harm communities in the Global South.

Despite these outcomes, there is hope to be found in people power. Indigenous activists and young people are confronting leaders, demanding not just climate action, but economic and racial justice as well. In looking ahead, Awa Traore calls for stronger resistance to center people and the planet at COP27.
