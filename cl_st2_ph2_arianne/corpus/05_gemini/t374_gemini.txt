Despite COVID-19 halting much of the world in 2020, Greenpeace activists documented global warming impacts from remote areas, thanks to the admirable commitment of ship crews, volunteers, and scientists.

Highlighted images from the ships Rainbow Warrior, Arctic Sunrise, and Esperanza show a range of actions. These include Antarctic petrels near a krill fishing area and teen activist Mya-Rose Craig holding the northernmost climate strike in the Arctic. Activists also protested against Shell's oil platform in the North Sea.

A flotilla and a 62-hour blockade led to Preem withdrawing its planned refinery expansion in Sweden. In Denmark, there were demands for a ban on oil and gas and an expansion of wind power. In Germany, sea protection projections were displayed. Activists were also documented with Jason Momoa's "Aquaman" trident as they prepared to occupy a Danish oil rig.
