Bob Hunter, a founder of Greenpeace, died on May 2, 2005, from cancer. Born in Winnipeg in 1941, he was a rebellious journalist who left his column at the Vancouver Sun to participate in the 1971 voyage protesting a U.S. nuclear test off Amchitka. It was then that he coined the name "Greenpeace," an event which sparked global environmental activism.

Serving as president from 1973 to 1977, Hunter pioneered tactics he called "media mindbombs," as well as actions that included dyeing seal pups and confronting whalers. In his later career, he hosted television shows and authored books, one of which was titled "Warriors of the Rainbow." He was known for his humor and optimism, and was inspired by the Cree myth of rainbow warriors.
