Rising fossil fuel prices are pushing affordable heating out of reach, creating a crisis of energy poverty while fossil fuel companies are reaping record profits.

The health consequences of this are severe, leading to higher hospital admissions and an increase in respiratory illnesses, particularly in children. The elderly face heightened risks of hypothermia and mental health issues. On a global scale, the human cost is staggering, with 3.2 million people dying annually from indoor pollution and another 4.5 million dying from exposure to cold.

This is a worldwide emergency. Nearly 1 billion people live without access to electricity, and in regions like Sub-Saharan Africa, this situation is worsening. In Europe alone, there are warnings of up to 335,000 excess winter deaths.

A clear path forward exists. The record profits of fossil fuel companies must be taxed. These funds can be used to provide direct support to households, launch large-scale building renovation programmes, and accelerate the shift to renewable energy, which is essential to end our dependence on fossil fuels.
