Forests, which absorb CO2 and release oxygen, are facing an alarming rate of deforestation. From 1990 to 2005, 14.5 million hectares of forest were lost every year, a rate equivalent to one football pitch every two seconds. In addition to this loss, forests are also suffering from degradation and fragmentation.

Efforts to combat the trade in illegal timber are being hindered by apathy from China, even though the EU has been cooperating with the country on this issue since 2009. A significant driver of this destruction is agriculture, which is responsible for 80% of all deforestation, fuelled by imports of commodities like palm oil and soy.

The EU must fully implement its FLEGT measures, influence China, and address its own consumption. Recognizing the issue in 2013, the Commission is considering new policies to achieve zero-deforestation supply chains by 2020. This includes supporting governance in producer countries, upholding indigenous rights, and providing funding for forest protection. However, there are concerns that enforcement of these measures is incomplete in countries like Spain, and there are risks of premature FLEGT approvals being granted.
