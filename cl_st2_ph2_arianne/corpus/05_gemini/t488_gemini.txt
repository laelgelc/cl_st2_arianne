In Kitui County, Kenya, Mwende, a smallholder farmer, depends on her three-acre plot of green grams, cowpeas, maize, and millet to support her family's livelihood and pay for school fees. After enduring three years of drought, recent heavy rains had promised a bumper harvest.

However, on February 3, a massive desert locust swarm invaded her farm. She spent days attempting to chase them away by swinging an iron sheet, a common local method. This outbreak is the worst the region has seen in decades and is being worsened by climate-driven cyclones, which create ideal breeding conditions for the locusts.

The swarms devour vast amounts of vegetation. Furthermore, the eggs they have laid threaten further invasions with the onset of upcoming rains. Farmers in the area are now urging for urgent government action to address this climate-exacerbated crisis.
