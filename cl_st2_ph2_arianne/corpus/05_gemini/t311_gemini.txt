Indigenous Land Defenders in the Amazon face increasing threats to their lives and homes as they work to protect vital ecosystems. On May 26, illegal gold miners, who have been emboldened by Brazil's Bolsonaro administration, attacked a Munduruku village. The attack involved gunfire and arson, and resulted in the home of leader Maria Leusa being burned down.

This is not an isolated event but part of ongoing violence. In March, the headquarters of an Indigenous women's association was destroyed, and attacks on the Yanomami people have also occurred.

The violence is directly linked to the profit-driven destruction of the land. From 2008 to 2020, miners destroyed over 61 km² of Munduruku land. The rate of this destruction has accelerated, with 63% of it occurring between 2019 and 2020 alone.

Greenpeace supports Indigenous rights globally and demands an end to this destruction.
