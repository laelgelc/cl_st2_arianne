Indigenous Karen leaders Prasert Pukad, Gip Tonnampetch, and Phanomphon Wanakhunsiri protested at Bangkok's Government House. They were demanding the recognition of their ancestral rights in Bang Kloi – Jai Paen Din, an area located within Kaeng Krachan National Park.

The leaders assert that their community has inhabited and guarded the forests sustainably for generations, long before the national park was established in 1981. Their traditional practices include shifting cultivation, which involves rituals that honor Mother Earth.

They decry government actions, including evictions and abuses, and state that there was a failure to consult with their community. The leaders have vowed to continue their fight for self-determination.

Greenpeace Thailand supports their cause, emphasizing that indigenous rights are essential for environmental conservation.
