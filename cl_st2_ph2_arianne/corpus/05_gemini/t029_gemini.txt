Illegal mining in the Amazon is a source of widespread devastation, causing deforestation and polluting vital rivers. This destructive activity fuels violence against Indigenous Peoples, whose lands are being invaded. Communities like the Yanomami, Munduruku, and Kayapó are facing the brutal consequences, which include the spread of diseases, sexual violence, murders, and the fracturing of their communities.

The scale of this crisis is staggering. A 2022 report on the Yanomami people revealed that 273 communities have been impacted, affecting over half of their total population of 27,000. The area of land destroyed by mining in their territory has surged by 625% since 2010.

The argument that this activity brings economic benefits is a fallacy. While illegal mining may offer short-term financial gains for some, it ultimately leaves a legacy of long-term poverty and severe health problems, such as mercury contamination, for the local populations.

We urge the Brazilian authorities to take decisive action. This must include evicting all illegal miners, enforcing the rights of Indigenous Peoples, and promoting sustainable policies for the region. With the new government under Lula, there is hope that these necessary steps will finally be taken to protect the Amazon and its people.
