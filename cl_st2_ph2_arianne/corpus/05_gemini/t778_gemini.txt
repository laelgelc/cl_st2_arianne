This Valentine's Day, incredible love stories are unfolding in the Antarctic. Adélie penguins show their affection by gifting rocks to their mates, helping to build a secure nest for their family.

The magnificent blue whale, with a heart the size of a gorilla, undertakes vast migrations to breed. Mothers then demonstrate incredible devotion, nursing their calves without eating. Down in the deep, the Turquet’s octopus has three hearts and offers what look like loving hugs. These creatures also provide us with valuable DNA insights into past climate change.

For a story of lifelong commitment, we can look to the albatross. These birds mate for life, a bond that can last up to 60 years, and they reunite each year to raise their chicks. Even tiny krill have their own romance deep underwater, a quick mating process described as a "chase, probe, embrace, flex & push."

To protect these species and their remarkable behaviours, we must protect their home. Join the call for an Antarctic Ocean Sanctuary.
