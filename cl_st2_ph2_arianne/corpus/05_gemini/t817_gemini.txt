Starting today, a dangerous pesticide is banned from all EU fields. This is a victory for bees, bumblebees, butterflies, and other insects.

The pesticide, fipronil, is notorious for its role in the 2017 contaminated egg scandal that spread across 49 countries, exposing the flaws in our industrial food system. Fipronil is also highly toxic to pollinators, especially when used to coat seeds before they are planted.

Greenpeace has campaigned for years to end the use of this chemical, first achieving restrictions in 2013 and now its complete prohibition in agriculture.

However, the fight is not over. Other harmful pesticides, like neonicotinoids, continue to threaten our environment. We must continue to push for further bans based on the scientific evidence.

The problem goes beyond individual chemicals. We need a fundamental shift away from industrial agriculture towards ecological farming. This is the way to tackle the interconnected crises of climate change, biodiversity loss, and pollution. The upcoming reform of the EU’s Common Agricultural Policy is a crucial opportunity to make this change happen.
