Environmental lawyer Sophie Marjanac of Client Earth began her journey in the Blue Mountains, with her path to environmental law being formed through university activism and land rights work with Indigenous Australians. She emphasizes that there is an intrinsic link between environmental protection and human rights.

This principle is central to a current wave of climate lawsuits targeting governments and fossil fuel companies, which have been inspired by cases like the Urgenda victory in the Netherlands. Marjanac highlights the groundbreaking investigation in the Philippines, which examined the human rights impacts of "carbon majors." While setbacks in this work can occur, she advocates for persistence and advises seeking support from defender networks. She finds hope in the passion of young people who are demanding climate action.
