The Netflix film "Don’t Look Up" is a satirical metaphor for the climate crisis that has achieved record-breaking viewership, though it has also prompted divisive opinions. The movie is praised for its humor, which effectively exposes societal denial, biases, and communication failures, leading to comparisons with other influential and socially relevant films.

Ecologist Nora Bateson provides insight, emphasizing that satire is a form of play that can reveal deeper truths and blind spots. The film is framed as a "mind bomb" with the purpose of shifting perceptions. It urges an examination of broader ecological overshoot that goes beyond climate to encompass issues of population and consumption. The mixed reviews the film has received often fall along ideological lines.
