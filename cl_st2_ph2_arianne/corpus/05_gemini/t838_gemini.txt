Over four days in the waters of Sierra Leone, Greenpeace, working from the ship Esperanza alongside local inspectors, uncovered multiple cases of illegal fishing.

During these inspections, one vessel was found to have committed infractions that resulted in the confiscation of passports and the imposition of fines. Two Chinese vessels, the Fu Hai Yu 1111 and the Fu Hai Yu 2222, were discovered to have hidden undersized nets with a mesh size of 51mm. These boats also had shark carcasses on board, were missing their logbooks, and had been offloading fish without a license. They were subsequently ordered back to port.

An Italian-flagged ship was found in possession of 4kg of shark fins, which is a violation of EU regulations. Greenpeace will report this case. Additionally, a Korean vessel named Cona had taken measures to obscure its name and had its Automatic Identification System (AIS) turned off. Onboard, inspectors found poor conditions for the crew and nets with a mesh size of 53mm, smaller than the 60mm legal minimum.

These events underscore the need for West African governments to cooperate in the management of their oceans.
