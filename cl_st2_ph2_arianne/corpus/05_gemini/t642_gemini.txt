An online film festival is taking place over 15 days, featuring 15 documentaries focused on environmental challenges, practical solutions, and global citizen initiatives.

Viewers can watch the films for free online. During the festival, you can vote for the People's Award, which will be given to the film with the most votes. There is also a Favourite Film Award for the documentary with the most views. After the festival, the winning films will be screened in several French cities, where they will be followed by public debates.

Highlighted films include *Ground for Hope*, which is about sustainable farming, and *Secret of the Oceans*, which looks at ocean communities impacted by climate change. Another featured documentary is *Banking Nature*, exploring financial threats to nature. Other films in the festival address subjects such as nuclear power, dairy dysfunctions, wildlife extinction, land-grabbing, and electronics waste.

The festival urges viewers to engage with the films and to adopt simple actions in their own lives.
