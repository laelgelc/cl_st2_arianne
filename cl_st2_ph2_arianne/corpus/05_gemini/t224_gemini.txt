In 2021, a series of inspiring animated films worked to expose environmental injustices and encourage action. These animations include the WoMin series, which highlights African women's resistance to the theft of resources and presents their visions for a better world.

One film, "A Plastic Story," serves as a warning about the legacy of inherited plastic pollution. Other animations offer critiques of the UK's plastic waste exports and expose the connections between big brands and the fossil fuel industry. The collection also features conversations with climate justice activists.

Further exposés reveal the greenwashing practices of corporations like TotalEnergies and uncover carbon offsetting scams. To help create a green and just future, viewers are called upon to share these videos, sign petitions, and explore more animations on these vital topics.
