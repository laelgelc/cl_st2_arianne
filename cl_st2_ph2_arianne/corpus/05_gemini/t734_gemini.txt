From the lavender fields of France to islands in Fiji and Germany, a growing movement is demanding climate justice through legal action. Diverse groups, including Portuguese beekeepers, Romanian shepherds, Kenyan school children, and Swedish Sámi youth, are all turning to the courts to hold governments and institutions accountable.

In one such case, the Swiss Senior Women for Climate Protection are suing their government. They argue for stronger greenhouse gas emission reductions to protect the health of vulnerable elderly people from the impacts of heat. A court decision on their case is currently pending.

Elsewhere, in Norway, Greenpeace Nordic and Nature and Youth are appealing against the granting of Arctic oil licenses. Their legal challenge is founded on the right to a healthy environment.

This fight for accountability extends to the European Union, where families from multiple countries have initiated a lawsuit. They contend that the EU's weak emission targets are a violation of their fundamental rights to life, health, occupation, and property.

These actions build on legal precedents such as the Urgenda case in the Netherlands, which already requires the government to take more ambitious climate action. An appeal in that case is upcoming.
