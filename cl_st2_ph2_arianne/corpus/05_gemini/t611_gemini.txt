In Brasília, Indigenous Peoples from across Brazil gather each year for the Free Land Camp. It is a time to share knowledge, offer mutual support, and demand that the government protect their rights. This year, the gathering is bittersweet. The administration of President Bolsonaro has weakened environmental tools and has not protected Indigenous communities from the violence, threats, and land invasions carried out by industries.

Indigenous Peoples hold constitutional rights to their traditional lands, which they have long fought to protect. In solidarity, global activists have demonstrated at Brazilian embassies with banners, music, and speeches. They are urging people to stand with these forest guardians to save the Amazon.

Since 2012, deforestation has been on the rise. An area equivalent to two soccer fields is now cleared every minute. This destruction threatens livelihoods and worsens the climate breakdown, leading to events like hurricanes and heat waves. Indigenous lands are the best-protected forests, yet the government is proposing to halt the recognition of these territories. This move would open them up to mining, logging, and agriculture. Join the movement to support them.
