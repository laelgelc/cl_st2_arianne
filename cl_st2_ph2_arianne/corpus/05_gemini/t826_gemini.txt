Rachel Carson’s 1962 book, *Silent Spring*, highlighted the harm the pesticide DDT was causing to birds. This led to bans that helped save species like the osprey. Despite this, global bird declines have since accelerated due to a combination of pesticides, habitat loss, climate change, cats, and other threats.

The scale of the loss is immense. In North America, 1.5 billion birds have been lost in 40 years. Some species have been hit particularly hard, with populations of Rufous hummingbirds, for example, declining by 60%. This crisis is driven by human activities, including agriculture, urban sprawl, and collisions. A historical example of such devastating human impact is Mao's failed sparrow eradication campaign in China.

These pressures are leading to extinctions, such as that of the Po'ouli, which underscore a much larger crisis of biodiversity loss. Species are now vanishing at 1,000 to 10,000 times the background rate, a loss that impacts entire ecosystems.
