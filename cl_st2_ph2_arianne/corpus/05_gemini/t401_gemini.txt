Greenpeace activists have climbed the 14-storey EU Commission headquarters in Brussels to protest Europe's complicity in global forest destruction. While there, they unfurled a banner and spread ashes, which symbolize the fires in the Amazon and the struggles of Indigenous Peoples.

The EU is responsible for over 10% of worldwide forest loss. This is driven by the fact that the EU imports 36% of all globally traded products linked to deforestation, including beef, palm oil, and soy. Companies made a promise in 2010 to eliminate deforestation from their supply chains by 2020, but they have failed to meet this commitment.

A strong EU law is needed to ban products linked to forest destruction. We are calling on people to participate in the Commission's public consultation to demand action against deforestation and the human rights abuses that go with it.
