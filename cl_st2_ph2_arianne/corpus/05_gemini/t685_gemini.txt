Waya Maweru, a student, barista, and Greenpeace Indonesia activist from Manado, shares her childhood memories of visiting her grandmother for Christmas in the beautiful region of North Sulawesi. She remembers a trip to Lembeh Island, where she could see Bitung and Mount Klabat.

She laments that Bitung has now been transformed into a site of forest destruction. Waya points to her favorite brands as having a role in endangering the habitats of the Cenderawasih bird, orangutans, and Sumatran tigers.

An experience on Kuta Beach in Bali inspired her to commit to direct action. She joined other global activists on a rubber boat to demand that Wilmar #DropDirtyPalmOil immediately. Their goal is to achieve greener forests and ensure wildlife can be free. Waya invites you to participate.
