On International Women’s Day, fossil fuel companies engage in public relations to promote their commitment to gender diversity. However, these are the same companies driving the climate crisis, which in turn exacerbates inequalities and violence against women and gender minorities.

When climate-related disasters occur, these groups face higher risks and have limited access to relief. The fossil fuel industry’s operations are also linked to an increase in sexual and physical violence. This is particularly evident in the "man camps" located near extraction sites, as was seen during the Bakken oil boom in North Dakota.

Internally, the fossil fuel industry is a patriarchal system with low rates of female employment and large gender pay gaps, which fuels further inequality.

To end this, a shift to renewables is essential. We must ban new fossil fuel projects and phase out existing ones to achieve true climate justice.
