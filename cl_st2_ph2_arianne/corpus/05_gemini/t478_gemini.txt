On International Women’s Day, a call is being made for global support to urge the government of Senegal to shut down fishmeal and fish oil factories. These factories cause illness in areas like Gandiol, Joal, and Mbour and divert fish needed for local food and livelihoods to industrial feed.

African women activists, including Hindou Oumarou Ibrahim, Makenna Muigai, Thando Kimora, Wore Gana Seck, Awa Traore, and Fatou Samba, are highlighting the vital roles women play in their communities. They emphasize the harm the industry causes to local economies, food security, and marine ecosystems, and how it undermines the UN Sustainable Development Goals amid the challenges of overfishing and climate change.

These activists are advocating for a review of legislation and for the protection of fish processors. They are also calling on people to pledge to Stand 4 Women.
