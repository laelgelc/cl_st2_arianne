Our oceans face threats from climate breakdown, plastic pollution, and overfishing. Now, an emerging industry, deep sea mining, poses another significant danger. This industry targets polymetallic nodules for metals used in electronics.

These deep sea ecosystems are home to unique species. The Ghost Octopus lays its eggs on sponges that grow on these nodules, dying as it protects them. The armored Sea Pangolin is sustained by bacteria, while the Yeti Crab farms microbes on its hairy arms, with females dying after breeding.

Mining in these areas would cause irreparable damage to these ecosystems and disrupt the species that live there. It would also worsen climate issues by affecting carbon stores.

Alternatives to this destruction exist, including the development of circular economies, recycling e-waste, and improving resource efficiency.

We must urge the creation of a strong Global Ocean Treaty to establish ocean sanctuaries and put a stop to destructive industries. You can help by signing the petition.
