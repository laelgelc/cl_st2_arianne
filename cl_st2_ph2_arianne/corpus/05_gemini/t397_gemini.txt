Scientists have reported that the Arctic sea ice minimum has reached its second-lowest level since measurements began, a clear signal of urgent climate breakdown. The Arctic could be free of summer ice by 2035.

Our ship, the Arctic Sunrise, is in the Arctic right now, witnessing this crisis firsthand. The Arctic is a priority area because healthy oceans are essential; they store carbon and help build resilience. The destruction of our oceans hits marginalized communities the hardest, especially in the Global South.

Leaders at the upcoming UN Biodiversity Summit must take action to protect our oceans and people. We are calling on them to protect at least 30% of our oceans by 2030. Join 3 million people in this demand. We must take unrelenting action to safeguard our planet.
