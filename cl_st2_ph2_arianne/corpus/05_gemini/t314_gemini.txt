From aboard Greenpeace's Rainbow Warrior, Fijian activist Victor Pickering is a witness to deep sea mining tests taking place in the Pacific's Clarion Clipperton Zone. In this region, companies such as GSR are pushing to exploit the ocean depths, a goal they pursue even after having lost equipment.

These operations continue despite warnings that they could cause irreversible damage to ecosystems, with effects lasting for millennia. Pickering highlights the multiple ocean crises already impacting Pacific communities, including sea level rise, depleted fish populations, and plastic pollution. For these communities, the sea is their identity and their lifeline.

Resistance to deep sea mining is growing among island nations like Fiji and Vanuatu, which are advocating for a ban. Pickering issues a call for solidarity and for a Global Ocean Treaty to protect 30% of the world's oceans by 2030. He urges a fundamental shift from exploitation to protection. Greenpeace supports a worldwide ban on deep sea mining.
