The so-called "trade war" is a distraction from the truly critical issues of our time: climate change and peace. The global trade regime as it stands is flawed, exacerbating both inequality and environmental harm. We must reject the model of neoliberal trade that actively undermines environmental policies.

Deals like the EU-Mercosur "cows for cars" agreement are a prime example, promoting increased deforestation and emissions. For too long, trade policy has been dominated by corporate lobbies, creating a system that threatens protective laws designed to serve the public interest.

It is time to demand a new approach. We need a trade system that is transparent and just. This system must respect foundational UN agreements like the Paris Accord, alongside human rights and sustainability. Trade must be reformed to prioritize equality and the well-being of future generations.
