For eleven years, Kate Nelson has been on a journey to live a plastic-free life. This path began after she witnessed the reality of ocean plastic pollution in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. To achieve this, she eliminated single-use items such as straws, bags, bottles, and cups from her daily routine.

Her solution was to embrace reusables, opting for cloth bags, glass jars, and other refillable vessels. Adopting this lifestyle had positive effects, fostering creativity, encouraging healthier eating habits, and strengthening her connections within her community.

Now, Kate Nelson is promoting Global Refill Day on November 6. She urges people to take action by bringing their own reusable containers to stores and requesting to have them filled. To amplify this movement, participants are encouraged to share photos of their efforts using the hashtags #ReuseRevolution and #BreakFreeFromPlastic. The goal of this initiative is to normalize the practice of reuse, inspire more people to join, and pressure companies to move toward offering refillable solutions for systemic change.
