The law firm Gibson Dunn & Crutcher has a history of sanctions resulting from fabricating evidence, lying, and legal misconduct. This has occurred while the firm defended corporations like Chevron.

Gibson Dunn utilized SLAPP suits and RICO claims in a New York court, presided over by Judge Lewis Kaplan, to target Ecuadorian pollution victims, their attorney Steven Donziger, and the Ecuadorian judiciary. The proceedings faced allegations of judicial bias, waived privileges, and trial irregularities. A witness, Alberto Guerra, was bribed and later admitted to lying.

While Judge Kaplan ultimately ruled against the victims, foreign courts are ignoring his ruling. The use of SLAPP suits is a threat to free speech.
