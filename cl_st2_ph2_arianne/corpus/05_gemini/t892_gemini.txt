Today is World Meat Free Day, a time to consider how reducing meat consumption can benefit both our personal health and the planet.

Industrial animal agriculture is a major driver of deforestation, water pollution, and climate change. It is responsible for 14% of all greenhouse gas emissions, an amount equivalent to the emissions from all road vehicles combined. To avoid catastrophe, we must adopt a "less is better" approach to meat consumption.

There are many options for making a change, from trying Meat Free Mondays and flexitarianism to choosing higher-quality meat. Even small changes can have a global impact. A sustainability calculator demonstrates that if just 10,000 people go meat-free for one day, it saves a significant amount of CO2 and water.
