The urgent need for Arctic protection is highlighted by record low sea ice. Amid this, the European Parliament's recent resolution is being criticized for favoring words over action. This raises questions as to why EU governments are allowing fishing in previously unfished Arctic areas, despite support for a moratorium. It also prompts us to ask why oil lobbies were able to weaken calls for a total ban on Arctic oil extraction.

There are examples of the ongoing threat, such as Norway's new drilling plans. However, progress has been seen with Shell's abandonment of exploration in Alaska and the off-limits declaration made by Obama and Trudeau for certain areas.

We must question governments and urge them to halt fossil fuels and instead invest in renewables. We should support a UN oceans treaty, push for a ban on heavy fuel oil, and demand the enforcement of fishing moratoriums. There is also a court case to stop oil rigs that can be promoted.
