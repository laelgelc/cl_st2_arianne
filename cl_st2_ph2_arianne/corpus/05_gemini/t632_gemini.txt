In Russia's Usinsk region, seismic surveys and oil exploration are leaving a trail of devastating impacts on the environment and local communities. The operations have resulted in polluted waters and widespread deforestation. Villagers describe how road construction has turned brooks muddy, while fish and wildlife are disappearing from the area.

The local population is directly affected by these activities. Explosions from the exploration work are powerful enough to shake their houses. The construction has also led to the loss of essential paths used for berry-picking and hunting, disrupting traditional livelihoods. Furthermore, residents face health risks from oil spills, a concern underscored by the memory of the 1994 disaster that contaminated the Pechora River.

In response, villagers are protesting what they describe as careless operations by the company Lukoil-Komi. They fear further environmental destruction and are standing up to protect their homes. For them, the land holds immense value for their livelihoods, a value they believe far outweighs what can be gained from oil extraction.
