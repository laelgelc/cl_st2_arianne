We are highlighting Mattel's use of packaging that is linked to the deforestation of Indonesian rainforests. To draw attention to this, we have satirically named Barbie's latest "career" as 'Rainforest Destroyer' and have launched a contest for people to design her new look.

This issue extends beyond just one company; similar problems exist within the supply chains of Hasbro, Disney, and Lego. We are urging all toy companies to make a commitment to suspend purchases from Asia Pulp and Paper until it brings a halt to its deforestation activities. These companies must also adopt strong sustainable procurement policies.

You can take action to support this campaign. We are calling on our supporters to message Mattel, share the revealing video about this issue, and engage with the campaign on social media. You can also join the contest to design Barbie's new look for a chance to win a prize.
