Industrial meat and dairy production is causing significant harm to the environment. This industry is responsible for forest destruction, the pollution of our water, and the creation of ocean dead zones. Its impact on climate change is equivalent to that of all global transportation combined.

In addition to environmental damage, high consumption of meat is linked to health issues such as cancer, heart disease, obesity, and diabetes. A shift towards plant-based diets could potentially save millions of lives.

We envision children as "Team Plant," inspiring the change our world needs. We are urging governments to take action by supporting ecological farming, reducing the number of mega-farms, and promoting plant-based food options in schools.

Individuals can also play a crucial part by reducing their personal meat consumption. A global movement is needed to build a healthier food system, which will lead to a healthier planet for us all.
