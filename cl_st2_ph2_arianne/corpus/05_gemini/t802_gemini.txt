After seven days, The People vs. Arctic Oil trial has concluded, with a judgment expected in early January 2018. Together with Nature and Youth, we argued that Norway's plans for Arctic oil drilling are in violation of Article 112 of the Norwegian Constitution, which grants people the right to a healthy environment. We also argued that these plans breach the commitments Norway made under the Paris Agreement to limit global warming to 1.5°C.

This legal challenge is part of a growing global movement. A UN Committee has urged Norway to revise its policy, noting that climate change has a disproportionate impact on women. Around the world, similar climate justice cases are advancing in the US, the Philippines, Germany, and the Netherlands.

The support for this historic trial has been significant, with over half a million people backing the case. In a related development, Norway's Central Bank has recommended that the country should divest from oil and gas. The movement to hold governments and corporations accountable continues to grow.
