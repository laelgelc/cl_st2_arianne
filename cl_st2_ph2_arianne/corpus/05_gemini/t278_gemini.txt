Unprecedented wildfires are currently ravaging eastern Russia. In Siberia's Yakutia region alone, over 300 active fires are burning, having consumed 17.08 million hectares. This area is larger than all other wildfires currently burning across the globe combined.

The devastating impact of these fires is being felt on a global scale. Smoke has traveled as far as the North Pole and has also reached Mongolia, Canada, and Greenland. Within Russia, cities are trapped by the smoke, leading to the closure of roads and airports and forcing people to evacuate their homes.

This crisis is unfolding amid record heat and drought conditions. Northern Siberia is warming three times faster than the global average, a factor that is exacerbating the fires and raising concerns that they could surpass the record set in 2012.

In response, Greenpeace Russia has proposed a Green Deal that calls for sustainable forestry and improved fire protection. We are urging governments to cut emissions, restore nature, and halt any cutbacks to forest protection services. It is also critical that local communities and firefighters receive support through urgent measures.
