For three years, Greenpeace and the Norwegian youth group Natur og Ungdom have been in a court case arguing that licenses for Arctic oil drilling violate the constitutional rights of future generations to a healthy environment.

Although we lost our case in the Court of Appeal, we won on key points. The court confirmed that Norway holds responsibility for the emissions generated from the oil it exports. It also affirmed that Article 112 of the constitution does provide protections for a healthy environment.

The court ultimately ruled that the oil drilling licenses do not conflict with this article. As a result of this decision, we are now appealing to the Supreme Court.

This case brings attention to the tension between Norway's green ideals and its oil-based economy. It is taking place amidst a global wave of climate litigation and a rise in activism.
