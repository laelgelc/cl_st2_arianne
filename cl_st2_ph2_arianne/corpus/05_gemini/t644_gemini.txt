The dysfunction of global politics was stark at COP24, where 15-year-old Greta Thunberg pointed out the truth of decades of failed pep-talks. Despite warnings about climate change going back to 1979, emissions have continued to rise.

In response to this failure, a youth coalition presented the "People’s Demands for Climate Justice." These demands are clear: we must keep fossil fuels in the ground and end all subsidies for them. We must reject false solutions, such as techno-fixes, and halt corporate interference in our politics. The demands also call for climate reparations from rich nations to those most affected.

The very idea of "green growth" is a delusion. Studies show that economic growth is tied to increased resource use and emissions. The only way to address our ecological overshoot is through systemic change, which requires contracting growth.
