Corporations have created a plastic monster. With over 90% of plastics going unrecycled and production on track to quadruple by 2050, recycling is not a sufficient solution. In response, a growing global movement is taking action. Over 3 million supporters and 1,400 allies in the Break Free From Plastic movement have conducted 239 cleanups in 42 countries to identify the top corporate polluters.

A Greenpeace report, "Crisis of Convenience," surveyed 11 major companies and found that despite their commitments, none have comprehensive plans to abandon single-use packaging. In fact, most of them plan to increase their use of it. To highlight the origins of this pollution, Greenpeace is deploying its ships, the Rainbow Warrior and the Beluga. We are urging companies like Nestlé and Unilever to be transparent about their plastic footprint, commit to reducing their reliance on single-use packaging, and invest in alternative solutions to help slay the plastic monster.
