Across North America, oil companies are building dangerous pipelines that threaten Indigenous rights, our drinking water, and wildlife. These projects contribute to climate change. One such project is the Dakota Access Pipeline from Energy Transfer Partners, a company that is currently suing Greenpeace for $900 million. Another is the Trans Mountain Expansion, which is risking the survival of orcas.

These pipeline projects rely on funding from the 'Dirty Dozen' global banks, which include institutions like Citibank and Deutsche Bank.

We must pressure these banks to stop funding such toxic pipelines. You can help by posting critical messages on their social media channels to damage their reputation and demand they halt their financial support for these projects.
