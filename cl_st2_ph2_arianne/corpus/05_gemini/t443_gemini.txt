The period after the COVID-19 pandemic offers a chance to redesign our cities for greater sustainability and resilience. We must advocate for a shift that prioritizes people over cars. This can be achieved by expanding bike lanes and public transport networks. To create green neighborhoods, we can even consider banning vehicles in certain areas.

Our current food systems are fragile, and industrial agriculture contributes significantly to emissions. A more resilient approach involves promoting local urban farming. Encouraging plant-based options and seasonal eating are also key components of this change.

To curb emissions, we must address overconsumption. A culture of reuse, repair, and sharing should be fostered to reduce our environmental impact.

Accessible green spaces are crucial for wellbeing. We should transform empty urban areas into community gardens, providing residents with nature and connection. In the face of both the climate and pandemic crises, building healthier and more equitable cities is essential, and this transformation can be powered by citizen-led action.
