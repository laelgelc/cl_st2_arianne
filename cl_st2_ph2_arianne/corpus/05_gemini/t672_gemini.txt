Sámi artist and activist Jenni Laiti explains that Sápmi, the traditional Indigenous territory of the Sámi people, spans northern Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Russia. For the Sámi, the land is what shapes their culture, spirit, and very survival.

This territory faces threats from government and corporate exploitation, including mines and logging. A new danger is a proposed Arctic Railway, intended to enable global trade by taking advantage of melting sea ice. This railway would divide the land, disrupt the migration of reindeer, and cause accidents. It would also spur further industrialization, such as pulp mills and more logging, leading to the destruction of vital forests. These forests are essential for the reindeer and are deeply connected to Sámi identity.

Laiti links this situation to IPCC warnings on climate change. She urges collective action to protect these forests, emphasizing that their preservation is necessary for global survival.
