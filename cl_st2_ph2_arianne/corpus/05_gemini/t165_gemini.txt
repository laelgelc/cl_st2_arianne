In Amsterdam, Greenpeace volunteers from 16 countries stood with Brazilian Indigenous leaders to protest by blocking a ship. The vessel was carrying 60 million kilos of soy from Brazil. The demonstrators are demanding a robust EU anti-deforestation law to protect forests, ecosystems, and the rights of Indigenous peoples.

The current draft of the law has gaps. It excludes areas like the Cerrado and offers weak protections for human rights. This is happening while corporations resist transparency. The EU’s soy imports, the majority of which are for animal feed, are a driver of deforestation and a threat to Indigenous communities.

To safeguard health, nature, and the climate, a reduction in meat and dairy consumption by 70% by 2030 is being urged. Over a million Europeans have already called for action on this issue.
