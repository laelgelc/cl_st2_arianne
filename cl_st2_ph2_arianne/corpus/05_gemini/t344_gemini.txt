Despite local successes, our planet is experiencing a global environmental decline. This trend is attributed to social inertia, which is the powerful momentum of societies resisting change due to a combination of economic, corporate, governmental, and individual constraints.

Studies by Garrett et al. highlight this problem, showing that carbon emissions and energy demands are inseparably linked to cumulative past and present economic growth. This relationship prevents the decoupling of economic expansion from environmental harm. Drawing on historical examples and expert quotes, it is clear that relying on unproven technologies and the model of endless growth is a critique-worthy approach.

To overcome this inertia, activism is crucial. It requires perseverance in communication and action, with the ultimate goal of building a sustainable society.
