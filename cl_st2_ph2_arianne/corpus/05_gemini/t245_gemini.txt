Greenpeace USA is urging Senators to end fossil fuel subsidies and support the climate provisions within the Build Back Better Act. In the EU, over 75,000 people have signed a petition calling for a ban on fossil fuel advertisements and sponsorships.

As leaders gather for COP26 in Glasgow, they must signal the end of the fossil fuel era. Major oil companies like BP and Shell are already facing limited access to the conference due to requirements related to their emissions plans.

Meanwhile, in a U.S. Congressional hearing, executives from ExxonMobil, BP, Chevron, Shell, and their lobbying groups refused to commit to halting their opposition to measures that would reduce emissions. They engaged in greenwashing and disinformation, which prompted the committee chair to announce that subpoenas would be issued for related documents.
