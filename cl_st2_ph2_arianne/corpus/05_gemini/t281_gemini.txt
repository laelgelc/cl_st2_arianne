Wildfires are escalating worldwide, with fires raging from Turkey and Greece to Russia, Brazil, the US, Canada, Italy, and Lebanon. These events are fueled by climate change, extreme heat, and drought.

The fires are destroying forests, wildlife, and the planet's capacity for carbon storage. This destruction worsens emissions and degrades air quality, which is especially concerning during the COVID-19 pandemic. In Brazil, illegal fires are burning in the Amazon under the Bolsonaro government. In the US and Canada, massive blazes are sending smoke to distant areas.

In response, Greenpeace is calling for the phasing out of fossil fuels and an end to all subsidies for the industry. The organization also urges for the protection of forests, with guidance from Indigenous peoples. These calls for urgent climate action coincide with the IPCC's latest report, which details the role of fossil fuels in causing weather extremes.
