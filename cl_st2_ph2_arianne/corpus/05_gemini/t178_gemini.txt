Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has exposed deep vulnerabilities in our energy systems and accelerated a global food crisis. The conflict is exacerbating food insecurity, hitting the climate-vulnerable Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region especially hard, as it relies heavily on grain imports from Ukraine and Russia.

The war disrupts supply chains and drives up food prices, worsening existing problems like water scarcity and reduced crop yields. This deepens humanitarian crises in places such as Yemen. Furthermore, our reliance on fossil fuels presents its own threats to food security, exemplified by dangers like the FSO Safer tanker.

The path forward requires a fundamental shift to resilient, local, and sustainable food systems. This transformation must be grounded in the principles of food sovereignty, championing ecological farming and community-led initiatives. At the same time, we must demand climate justice from wealthy nations.
