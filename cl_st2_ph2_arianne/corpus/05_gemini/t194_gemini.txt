Off Yemen's Red Sea coast, the abandoned FSO Safer oil tanker poses a dire risk. It holds over 1.1 million barrels of crude oil, creating the potential for devastating spills or explosions that would impact human life, wildlife, fisheries, and ecosystems.

A catastrophic event would have severe effects on fishing communities. The cleanup effort alone would result in massive amounts of hazardous waste. The oil itself presents serious health dangers, as its toxic and carcinogenic properties can affect organs, skin, and lungs. For those in the region, safety advice includes using protective equipment and coordinating with authorities. People should avoid contaminated areas and must not attempt informal cleanups or burn any waste.

While Greenpeace welcomes the agreement to transfer the oil from the decaying tanker, we urge for the immediate deployment of containment booms and standby response equipment to mitigate the risks. This looming disaster is a direct result of the oil industry's legacy, and we continue to call for its end to prevent future catastrophes.
