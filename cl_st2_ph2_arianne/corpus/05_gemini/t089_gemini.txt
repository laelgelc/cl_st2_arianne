A staple food for the people of Thailand, the once abundant and affordable Thai mackerel, is now scarce. The cause is unregulated overfishing of juveniles, which has led to a devastating decline in population. Catches in 2020 were ten times lower than they were in 2014. As a result, the fish available are smaller, often imported, and more expensive, creating a crisis that threatens food security for the country's poor.

In response, local fishers from 23 provinces have organized to protect their livelihoods and this vital food source. They have campaigned against the practice of catching juvenile fish, established nurseries to help stocks recover, and urged supermarkets to stop selling undersized mackerel.

Their campaign culminated in the "Reclaim Mackerel Chili Paste" voyage. Fishers sailed over 1,000 kilometres from Pattani to the parliament in Bangkok, arriving on World Oceans Day to deliver their demands. They called on the government to enforce Section 57 of the Fisheries Act, which is meant to protect juvenile fish.

The voyage successfully generated media coverage and raised public awareness, prompting a promise of action from the government. However, no action has followed this promise. The fishers have now issued a 60-day ultimatum for the government to enforce the law and save the Thai mackerel.
