In response to concerns raised by the film Cowspiracy, we deny receiving any funding from the meat industry and affirm our independent stance.

Our campaigns actively target the environmental impacts of animal agriculture, which is responsible for an 18% share of global greenhouse gas emissions and is a key driver of Amazon deforestation. Our efforts focus on specific areas such as cattle ranching, the production of soya for animal feed, and destructive fishing practices. These campaigns have led to significant victories, including Nike halting its purchases of leather from the Amazon, the withdrawal of a World Bank loan, reforms to McDonald's soya sourcing, and improved tuna fishing practices.

While we promote veganism and reduced meat consumption, our primary emphasis is on systemic changes rather than individual mandates. We recognize the importance of considering cultural and accessibility factors in different communities. Our overarching goal is to achieve a 50% reduction in meat and dairy production and consumption by 2050.
