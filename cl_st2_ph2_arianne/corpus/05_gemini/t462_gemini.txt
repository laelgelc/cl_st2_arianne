The COVID-19 crisis has links to environmental factors. A concept known as the "dilution effect" suggests that biodiversity can reduce the spread of disease. However, activities like deforestation, mining, and urbanization are increasing human contact with wildlife and the viruses they may carry, a point noted by expert Kate Jones.

Climate change is also altering infectious disease patterns. Rising temperatures and extreme weather events enable the spread of pathogens through hosts such as mosquitoes. Zoonotic diseases, which jump from animals to humans, account for 75% of all emerging infectious diseases, and their rise is connected to habitat loss.

As we face the economic fallout from the pandemic, there are risks to green transitions. Radical government actions are now urged to ensure the creation of a sustainable post-pandemic world.
