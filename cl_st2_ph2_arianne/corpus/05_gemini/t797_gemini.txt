A global shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy is underway, but the question remains: is it happening fast enough to avert climate catastrophe?

Samsung Electronics is being criticized for its slow progress, with its operations currently powered by a mere 1% of renewable energy. The company's plan to announce a renewable energy strategy is not scheduled until August 2018. This slow pace is in stark contrast to the speed with which it handled the Note7 recall.

In Samsung's home country, the South Korean government has set a goal of reaching 20% renewable energy by 2030. Furthermore, the 2018 Winter Olympics will be powered entirely by 100% renewable energy. Despite being a sponsor of the games, Samsung lags behind these national efforts.

Public demand for change is clear. A recent survey revealed that 85% of Koreans want companies to transition to 100% renewable energy.

Samsung must embrace renewables swiftly to avoid being on the wrong side of history. We urge you to call for action by signing the petition with the hashtag #DoBiggerThings.
