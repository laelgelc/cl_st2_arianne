Around the world, Greenpeace offices have documented extreme weather events. In Japan, Germany, Denmark, Switzerland, and Korea, extreme heatwaves have been recorded, with some breaking records. These conditions have led to devastating forest fires across Russia, Greece, and California, affecting millions of people and causing fatalities.

At the same time, flooding has increased in southern France and India. In the Philippines, a recent storm worsened the plastic pollution crisis, as waste clogged drains and washed ashore.

These events demonstrate that climate change affects everyone, crossing all borders. It is essential that we limit global warming to 1.5°C, in line with the Paris Agreement. To do this, we must curb the use of fossil fuels and halt funding for coal and pipelines. We can help inspire collective action by sharing images of what is happening to our planet to pressure governments and corporations to make the necessary changes.
