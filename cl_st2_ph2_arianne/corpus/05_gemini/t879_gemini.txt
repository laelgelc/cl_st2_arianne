Many of us see technology as a force for good, relying heavily on our phones for daily tasks. However, this convenience is undermined by a culture that treats electronics as disposable. This approach leads to gadgets with short lifespans and a staggering amount of e-waste, which grew from 48.9 million tonnes in 2012 and is projected to reach 65.4 million by next year.

The environmental cost begins long before a device is discarded. The manufacturing process for our gadgets is incredibly resource-intensive. A single device can require around 40 different elements and consumes vast quantities of water to produce.

There is an alternative to this wasteful cycle. As the CEO of iFixit, the author champions the power of repair to combat this problem. We can reduce waste and empower ourselves by learning to fix our own devices using free tutorials. We have the choice to repair old gadgets, upgrade our computers instead of replacing them wholesale, and make a conscious effort to purchase products that are designed to be repairable from the start.
