Illegal mining in the Amazon poses a threat to the health and livelihoods of local communities. Following rumors of gold, hundreds of rafts have gathered on the Madeira River near the municipality of Autazes.

On November 23, Greenpeace Brazil documented this activity. The miners are known to receive support from businessmen and politicians in locations such as Humaitá. A significant environmental impact of this mining is mercury contamination, which pollutes the rivers.

Despite awareness of the situation, environmental agencies Ibama and Ipaam have faced resource cuts under the Bolsonaro government. After pressure was applied, an operation was launched on November 28, which led to the destruction of 70 rafts and the arrest of 10 miners. However, a public announcement about the operation by Vice-President Mourão allowed many miners to escape.

Data from MapBiomas shows that mining areas sextupled between 1985 and 2020. Most of this growth has been in the Amazon, with a surge of activity on Indigenous lands and in conservation units. The government lacks the will to protect the forest, even in the face of the climate crisis.
