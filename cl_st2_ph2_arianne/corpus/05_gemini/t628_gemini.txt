For Sámi reindeer herder Jussa Seurujärvi, returning from herding in the logged forests of Sápmi reveals a difficult reality. The reindeer now require supplemental food because of habitat loss caused by logging, mining, and other heavy land use. This situation poses a threat to generations-old traditions that are intrinsically linked to reindeer, hunting, and fishing.

A new threat is a proposed Arctic railway, which would cause further damage to pastures and water, and to Sámi identity. This is despite a report that has already deemed the project uneconomical and harmful. The Sámi communities view this as a form of ongoing colonization and are opposing the railway.

They are not alone. There is global support from thousands, including Greenpeace and indigenous groups from Canada and New Zealand. Together, they are urging more people to join the fight.
