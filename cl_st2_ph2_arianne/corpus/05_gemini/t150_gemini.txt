Luís Ferreirim, the Head of Agriculture at Greenpeace Spain, is being sued by the company Valle de Odieta S.C.L. for his criticism of their factory farms. These include a massive dairy operation in Caparroso with 7,200 cows and a planned mega farm in Noviercas with 23,520 cows.

Factory farms throughout Europe are harmful to the environment, the climate, animals, and small farmers. While the number of farms in the EU is declining, meat production is increasing. This lawsuit is a SLAPP (Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation) intended to silence critics, and it follows a pattern of similar cases in Spain.

Ferreirim refuses to retract his statements. He cites the company's violations, such as animal mistreatment, unauthorized expansions, and a toxic spill that occurred in the Aragón River. He urges people to share this story, adopt more plant-based diets, and demand that governments provide support for sustainable farming to stop the expansion of factory farms.
