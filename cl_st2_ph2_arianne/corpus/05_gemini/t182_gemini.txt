According to Greenpeace scientist Reyes Tirado, the IPCC's Working Group III report highlights powerful climate solutions that are available right now. These solutions, including renewables, halting deforestation, and shifting to plant-based diets, could halve global emissions by 2030, and are often low-cost.

Despite the availability of these solutions, current government policies are putting us on a path to failure. Urgent action is required to avoid an unlivable future.

The key steps needed include protecting ecosystems while respecting the rights of Indigenous peoples. We must reduce industrial livestock, a goal that can be achieved through dietary changes. A phase-out of all fossil fuels is necessary, and finance must be redirected toward equitable solutions.

To drive the necessary political change, Tirado urges people to take action through mobilization, protests, and voting. Personal shifts, such as moving to renewable energy and adopting low-meat diets, also contribute to this effort.
