Despite the overwhelming availability of environmental data, human society often remains stuck in destructive habits, a state that can be likened to addiction and paralysis. Systems theory, particularly from Gregory Bateson, helps explain why facts alone are often not enough to inspire transformation. Change is driven by the recognition of significant differences, which are made visible through coded actions rather than raw information. Actions such as Greenpeace protests serve as these coded messages, highlighting critical distinctions in a way that data cannot.

Our own contradictory motivations and memory contribute to this inertia. However, biology offers models for social transformation through the lens of exploratory adaptation. Examples like ant epigenetics and the responses of cells to stress demonstrate how living systems can adapt and change. This suggests that for society to move forward, we must abandon piecemeal efforts in favour of systemic approaches. The power of metaphors and stories becomes more important than isolated facts in driving this kind of deep-seated change. For those acting as change agents, the way forward involves integrating relationships with a sense of humility, which is essential for making genuine ecological progress.
