Our current economic system is fundamentally flawed, rooted in inequality, overconsumption, and the impossible pursuit of infinite growth on a finite planet. This model, dependent on unsustainable resource extraction, is directly worsening the crises of climate change and biodiversity loss.

Governments are actively fuelling this destruction by misallocating billions to fossil fuel subsidies, propping up the very industries causing the climate crisis instead of investing in the renewable energy solutions we so urgently need. The potential for change is immense; simply removing these fossil fuel subsidies could cut global emissions by up to 10% by 2030.

We need a radical transformation. We must reimagine and build an equitable system that operates within our planetary boundaries. This requires a fundamental shift in priorities, putting people and nature before profit. This can be achieved through major public investments in sustainable infrastructure and in new systems for food, energy, and mobility.

This is a call to collectively envision these alternatives, working together to foster a future built on solidarity and harmony.
