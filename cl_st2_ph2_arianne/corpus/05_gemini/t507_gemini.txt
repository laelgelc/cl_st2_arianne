Around the world, we are witnessing extreme weather events linked to climate change, from droughts and floods to devastating fires. In the Arctic and Antarctic, ice is melting.

A Greenpeace analysis has shown that fires on Indonesian peatlands between 2015 and 2018 emitted an amount of CO2 equivalent to Russia's total annual output. These emissions, comparable to those from coal plants, are "carbon bombs" that go unaccounted for by companies and countries. In addition to their global impact, these fires create a toxic haze.

Sustainability leaders and global brands are indirectly responsible for this situation through their palm oil supply chains. There is a need for transparent action to stop the burning and protect the forests. We must foster a green and peaceful world for the generations to come.
