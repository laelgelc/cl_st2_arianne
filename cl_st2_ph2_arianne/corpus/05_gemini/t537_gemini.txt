Amid the climate emergency, the IPCC report on oceans and cryosphere is urging accelerated efforts. In response, global actions are underway.

Protests have included graffiti in Lebanon and responses to the UN Summit. In the Philippines, activists have blockaded Shell, while in Poland, there has been a blockade against coal. Climbers have targeted Burger King in London and a bridge in Texas. Banners have been displayed in Sweden and the Netherlands, and a report on car industry emissions was released in Germany.

Massive climate strikes have drawn millions of participants. Alongside these actions, Indigenous declarations are calling for justice. Campaigns are also targeting companies linked to deforestation, such as fast food giants.
