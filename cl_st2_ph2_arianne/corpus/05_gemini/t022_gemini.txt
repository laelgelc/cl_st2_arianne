Witnessing the sheer scale of clothes waste in Kenya brings the fashion industry's environmental failures into sharp focus. This reality is compounded by its social failures, starkly remembered on the 10th anniversary of the Rana Plaza disaster in Bangladesh, where 1,134 workers tragically died.

In response to growing criticism, the industry has often resorted to greenwashing. A new Greenpeace report details how misleading labels like 'Sustainable' and 'Green' are used, finding that most of these claims are unsubstantiated.

However, there are some positive examples. Brands including Vaude, Coop, Tchibo, H&M, and Calzedonia are making advances in traceability and the durability of their products.

This issue is not new for us. Our Detox campaign fought against the use of toxic chemicals in the industry. Today, the call continues for fundamental change. We need transparency and a drastic reduction in waste. The linear model of fast fashion must be abandoned in favour of a system of true circularity.
