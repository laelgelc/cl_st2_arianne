For 16 years, communities in Rio Manicoré, Brazil, home to 4,000 people, have fought to establish a Sustainable Development Reserve (RDS). Their goal is to protect local forests and enable the sustainable use of resources. These communities recently secured a collective use concession (CDRU) covering 3,899.32 km², but this concession requires proper implementation to successfully prevent land grabbing and other illegal activities.

The struggle in Rio Manicoré is part of a larger issue. Across the Amazon, there are over 500,000 km² of undesignated forests that face deforestation. The threats to these areas come from land grabbing, mining, logging, and ranching. This situation has been exacerbated by the anti-environmental policies and violence under Bolsonaro.

In response, Greenpeace's "Amazon We Need" expedition is working to highlight the stories of communities like those in Rio Manicoré. The expedition also supports biodiversity research and advocates for the protection of forests and the adoption of sustainable models.
