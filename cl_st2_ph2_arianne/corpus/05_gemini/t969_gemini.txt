A growing trend is seeing corporations and governments use Strategic Litigation Against Public Participation—or SLAPP suits—to try and silence environmental activists. These lawsuits are designed to intimidate and silence critics by burdening them with the cost of a legal defense until they abandon their criticism or opposition.

This tactic has been used around the world. In India, the company Essar filed lawsuits against Greenpeace India in response to protests concerning the Mahan forest. Separately, Tata Sons' request for a takedown of material was denied. In the Netherlands, Shell sought an injunction against Greenpeace Netherlands, which ultimately failed. In Canada, the logging company Resolute filed a defamation claim against Greenpeace Canada.

Governments have also used these methods. Russia brought charges against the activists known as the Arctic 30, and Mexico brought charges against an individual protesting the state-owned oil company PEMEX.

In response to this threat against free speech and activism, Greenpeace is urging for the adoption of anti-SLAPP legislation. Such laws are essential to protect environmental defenders and ensure that democratic debate is not silenced by those with deep pockets.
