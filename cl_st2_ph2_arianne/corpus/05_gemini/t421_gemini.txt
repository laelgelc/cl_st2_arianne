In Baja California Sur, Mexico, the coral reef of Cabo Pulmo is home to a diverse array of marine life, including fish, crustaceans, mollusks, birds, and mammals, many of which are at risk.

Twenty-five years ago, this area was threatened by overfishing and irresponsible tourism. In response, local communities organized, an effort that led to Cabo Pulmo’s declaration as a National Marine Park in 1995. The results were remarkable. Fish populations increased by over 400%, and migratory species such as whale sharks, mantas, humpback whales, turtles, and sharks returned to the area. The local communities successfully shifted their economies to ecotourism.

However, in 2008, a new threat emerged. A project by the company Hansa Urbana, known as "Cabo Cortés," posed a danger of pollution and habitat destruction to the reef. A new movement rose to defend the park, and campaigns with Greenpeace, which included a petition signed by 220,000 people, led to the project's cancellation in 2012.

The story of Cabo Pulmo highlights the impact of people power. It is an example of why we must work to protect 30% of our oceans through the creation of ocean sanctuaries and the implementation of a Global Ocean Treaty.
