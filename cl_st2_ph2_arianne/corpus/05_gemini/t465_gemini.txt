The unprecedented social isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic offers a moment for reflection, comparable to historical global crises. For environmentalists in isolation, an essential ecology reading list has been compiled.

The list describes key books, including Vandana Shiva's critique of industrial agriculture and Gregory Bateson's exploration of ecological thinking. It features Andrea Wulf's biography of Humboldt and William Catton's analysis of overshoot. The environmental ethic of the Tao Te Ching is highlighted, as is Arne Naess's Deep Ecology anthology.

Additional recommendations cover topics like biomimicry, ecological economics, and nature poetry. For a deeper understanding, the importance of direct communion with wild systems is emphasized.
