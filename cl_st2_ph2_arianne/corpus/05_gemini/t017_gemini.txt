Amid the hunger and unemployment brought on by COVID-19 lockdowns in the Philippines, a simple yet powerful idea took root. In April 2021, Patricia Non initiated the Maginhawa community pantry, a simple cart offering food guided by the principle: "give what you can, take what you need."

This single act of community support sparked a nationwide movement. The model spread to over 6,700 pantries across the country, feeding thousands of people, including jeepney drivers who had lost their livelihoods. The pantries did more than just provide immediate relief; they forged vital connections between communities. Small farmers, such as Rosalina Tagle, were linked with urban centers, creating a system that helped prevent their crops from going to waste.

This grassroots network evolved into what became known as the BuyAnihan system. This approach moved beyond simple aid to emphasize food sovereignty, championing local sourcing and providing direct support to farmers. Despite facing challenges like red-tagging, the movement demonstrated the power of mutual aid and community resilience. It stands as a clear call for government action to create sustainable and reliable access to food for everyone.
