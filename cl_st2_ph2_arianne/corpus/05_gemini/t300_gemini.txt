September 2021 marks fifty years since our first campaign: a protest against a U.S. nuclear bomb test scheduled for Amchitka, Alaska.

Our origins can be found in 1960s Vancouver, a city that became a convergence point for peace activists, ecologists, and draft resisters. In this environment, shaped by anti-war, civil rights, and environmental movements, a group of individuals came together. Among them were Irving and Dorothy Stowe, Bob Hunter, Ben and Dorothy Metcalfe, Jim and Marie Bohlen, and Bill Darnell.

They formed the Don’t Make a Wave Committee. Drawing inspiration from Quaker protests, their plan was to sail a boat to confront the nuclear test directly. It was from this core idea that a new name was adopted, one that merged the ideals of peace and ecology: Greenpeace.
