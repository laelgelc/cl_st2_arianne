Better land use is essential if we are to survive the climate crisis. Industrial agriculture is a destructive force, destroying forests and biodiversity and pushing countless species toward extinction.

To counter this, we must halt the expansion of agriculture into natural ecosystems. It is critical to restore these natural areas and adopt ecological farming methods. This means reducing the use of chemicals and actively protecting insects. A fundamental part of this solution involves respecting the rights of Indigenous Peoples, as the lands they steward are proven to preserve biodiversity.

The damage from current practices runs deep. Intensive farming degrades the soil, which is a key carbon store. Furthermore, our food system can be part of the solution. By shifting to more plant-based diets and consuming less meat, we can improve the efficiency of our land use, feed more people, and enhance public health. Such a shift would also cut emissions that come from both agriculture and deforestation.

Ultimately, protecting our forests and grasslands is vital. These ecosystems are crucial for sequestering carbon, and their preservation is necessary to limit global warming to 1.5°C.
