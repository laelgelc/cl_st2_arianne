In April 2019, Greenpeace activists across the globe took action against Nestlé's reliance on single-use plastics. We delivered symbolic "plastic monsters," constructed from the company's own plastic waste, to its offices and factories to send a clear message.

The global mobilisation began on April 11, when we crashed Nestlé's Annual General Meeting. This was followed by a wave of protests on April 16 in Kenya, Italy, Switzerland, Slovenia, the US, Canada, and Poland. Further actions took place in Malaysia and Mexico on April 22. In one notable action, a massive plastic monster journeyed from the Netherlands to Switzerland along the Rhine river.

These protests served to highlight the sheer scale of Nestlé's plastic footprint. In 2018, the company was responsible for producing 1.7 million tonnes of plastic packaging. We are urging Nestlé to invest in refill and reuse systems and to #BreakFreeFromPlastic.
