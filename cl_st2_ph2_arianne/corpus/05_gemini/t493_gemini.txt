Oil companies like BP are investing billions in new oil and gas drilling. If burned, these fossil fuels will push global warming beyond the Paris Agreement's 1.5ºC limit, worsening climate disasters like floods and wildfires.

To justify their expansion, these companies rely on offsetting their emissions with unrealistic carbon capture technologies and massive tree planting. Such large-scale tree planting could harm food production and human rights. This strategy ignores clear warnings from the IPCC and IEA that these carbon removal methods are unfeasible at the scale needed.

The real solution is to rapidly reduce emissions. There can be no new fossil fuels, and current production must be phased down. These funds must instead be redirected to clean energy.
