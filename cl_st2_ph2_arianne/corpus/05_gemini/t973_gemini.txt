Greenpeace has discovered a massive black wastewater plume off the coast of Shishi, China, which comes from the Wubao Dyeing Industrial zone. This industrial area has been linked to the production of children's clothing.

Hazardous chemicals, including nonylphenol, chlorinated anilines, and antimony, were found in the industrial discharges. These same chemicals were also found as residues in exported clothes from manufacturing hubs in Shishi and Zhili. The presence of these substances poses health risks to children, as they can disrupt hormones and development.

China currently lacks strict regulations, and many coastal discharge points are polluting illegally. In response, Greenpeace is urging the government to establish a policy for chemical disclosure. We are also calling on brands such as Adidas and Disney to detox their supply chains, following the lead of companies like Zara and Mango who have already made commitments.
