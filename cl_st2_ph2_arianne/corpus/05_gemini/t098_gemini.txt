We envision a world transformed by 2032, one that prioritizes people and the planet over profit and growth. This future is inspired by Indigenous concepts, including the principle of considering the impacts of our actions on seven future generations and the Ubuntu philosophy of an interconnected humanity.

Recent crises have exposed the weaknesses of our current systems. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted our reliance on caregivers, while the war in Ukraine revealed the deep flaws within food and energy systems that are dependent on fossil fuels.

Through its Alternative Futures programme, Greenpeace is amplifying solutions from the global majority and challenging the colonial and capitalist inequalities that fuel these problems. We are calling for a just transition to renewables, the creation of equitable societies, and a world that exists in harmony with nature.
