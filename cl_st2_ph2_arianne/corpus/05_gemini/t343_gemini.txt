This Women’s History Month, we honor the women who helped found Greenpeace nearly 50 years ago, focusing on their roles in the inaugural voyage protesting U.S. nuclear tests near Amchitka Island.

Dorothy Stowe co-founded Greenpeace and provided stabilizing leadership. It was Marie Bohlen who proposed sailing to the test site, and she also co-founded the Don’t Make A Wave Committee. Dorothy Metcalfe relayed media reports, encouraged the crew to persist, and lobbied Canadian MPs. Zoe Hunter introduced Bob Hunter to pacifism and helped to provision the ships.

The all-male crew on that voyage was a mistake that overlooked the essential contributions of these women.
