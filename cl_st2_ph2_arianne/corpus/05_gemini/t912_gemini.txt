An International Poster Contest for the Arctic has drawn an incredible response, with over 2000 submissions pouring in from more than 40 countries. These powerful works of art are designed to raise awareness about the industrial threats facing the region, including oil exploration and destructive fishing. The posters also showcase the rich diversity of Arctic species.

The ultimate goal of this creative movement is to urge politicians to protect the Arctic. To bring the message directly to the region, three winners of the contest will be chosen to join Greenpeace on an expedition to Svalbard.

This artistic energy is also taking over city streets. At an Urban Art Festival in Barcelona, 35 artists from 8 different countries came together to paint 600 meters of walls with their own interpretations of the Arctic.

As Einstein once said, "Creativity is contagious, pass it on."

The poster contest ends on April 30.
