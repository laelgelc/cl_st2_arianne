Since the 1960s, the North Sea oil industry has generated billions in both profits and government revenue. This industry, however, has fueled the climate crisis. It has led to marine pollution equivalent to one oil tanker accident per year and one chemical accident per day, and has endangered biodiversity.

Currently, job losses in the sector are rising without a just transition for workers, while emissions continue to accelerate the climate emergency. The post-COVID recovery risks causing further harm to our oceans, climate, and vulnerable communities.

It is time for a #NorthSeaRevolution. We must transition to a fossil fuel-free North Sea that is powered by 100% renewables. This will create greener jobs and protect marine life. Immediate action is needed to #BuildBackBetter.
