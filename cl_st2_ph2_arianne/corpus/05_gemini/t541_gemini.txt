Joanna Sustento, a climate activist from Tacloban, Philippines, lost most of her family in the 2013 super typhoon Haiyan, a disaster worsened by climate change. She refuses to stay silent as lives and livelihoods are sacrificed for corporate profits. On her journey, she has found personal strength and support.

In a letter to Shell and the oil industry, Joanna demands justice for her nephew, Tarin, who was lost in the storm, and for the thousands of others who were killed in affected communities. She urges the industry to mitigate the impacts of the climate crisis before it is too late, reminding them that the futures of their own families are also at risk.
