In a letter from Greenpeace leaders Jennifer Morgan and Anabella Rosemberg, they stress that the choices made during the COVID-19 crisis will fundamentally shape the climate emergency. They urge for investments to be directed toward public and planetary health to ensure a just transition, rather than bailing out planet-wrecking industries.

The leaders call for vigilance against those who would exploit the crisis, a phenomenon known as the 'shock doctrine'. Instead, they advocate for a cooperative and egalitarian future that is in harmony with nature. They note that the virus demands community and compassion, not blame, and that our focus must be on protecting the most vulnerable among us and learning deep lessons from this experience.

On a personal level, they share that they are also facing family challenges. They highlight the acts of courage they are witnessing and emphasize the need for everyone to prioritize care while simultaneously remaining vigilant.
