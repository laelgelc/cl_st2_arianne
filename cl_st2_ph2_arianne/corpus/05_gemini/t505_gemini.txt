In 2019, massive wildfires ravaged forests across the world, from Russia and Brazil to Indonesia and Australia. These fires resulted in the deaths of both wildlife and humans, while emitting vast amounts of CO2 into the atmosphere.

The scale of these emissions is staggering. Russia's fires released 500 megatonnes of CO2, Brazil's fires released 366 megatonnes, and Indonesia's fires released 708 megatonnes. To put this in perspective, these amounts are equivalent to the annual fossil fuel emissions of major countries. According to a Greenpeace report, the nations responsible are underreporting these fire emissions, with no proper accounting or compensation mechanisms in place.

The climate impact extends beyond CO2. The fires also produce black carbon, a substance that accelerates the melting of Arctic ice. Furthermore, the destruction of these forests reduces their crucial capacity to capture carbon from the atmosphere.

Despite the devastating impacts on our climate, on health, on communities, and on Indigenous Peoples, this crisis was ignored at COP25. Leaders must be urged to act on this urgent issue.
