Despite its image as a nature-loving country, Norway is failing to protect the oceans. The nation has positioned itself as an opponent to a strong Global Ocean Treaty. This opposition is part of a pattern; in 2016, Norway blocked the creation of protected areas in the Central Arctic Ocean, and last year, it worked with Russia and China to block protections in the Antarctic.

The government's spending reveals its priorities, with more funds allocated to oil exploration, at €6.9 million, than to ocean protection. The country also has plans for drilling in the Arctic. Prime Minister Erna Solberg has dismissed the need for ocean protection by claiming it does not create jobs, a stance that ignores warnings from the scientific community.

Domestically, Norway has protected less than 1% of its coastal areas, falling far short of the 10% it promised to protect by 2020. The country also resists international conservation efforts, such as the target to create sanctuaries in 30% of the world's oceans.
