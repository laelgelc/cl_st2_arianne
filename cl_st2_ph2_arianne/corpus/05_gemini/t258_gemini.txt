The world has warmed 1.2°C since pre-industrial times, yet governments and companies continue to make empty promises amid the climate crisis. Urgent action is needed to end our reliance on fossil fuels and animal products, and to halt the deforestation that threatens biodiversity, Indigenous Peoples, and the global climate.

Forests are vital for carbon storage. However, their destruction for industrial agriculture reduces this capacity and adds further emissions to the atmosphere. A Carbon Brief analysis, which includes deforestation, ranks Brazil as the fourth biggest polluter globally. Under the Bolsonaro government, deforestation in the Amazon has surged to the point where the rainforest is at risk of becoming a net carbon emitter.

At the same time, animal production contributes 19% of global greenhouse gases, with nearly half of that coming from methane.
