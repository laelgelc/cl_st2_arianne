Our planet is experiencing unprecedented heating. We are seeing record temperatures and escalating climate disasters that are affecting regions all over the world.

It is time to reconsider our use of cars, due to the pollution they cause and the dangers of heat. Instead, we should use public transport. There are other solutions we can embrace. We can plant trees and flowers, adopt plant-based diets, and avoid using plastics. We must also advocate for renewables.

Amid fear, there is reason for hope. We should encourage protests against fossil fuels and demand climate justice. We must also call for the declaration of climate emergencies.

To survive extreme heat, it is important to stay hydrated and eat lightly. We need to slow down and stay cool indoors. Dressing lightly is also recommended. It is crucial to build support networks with others. Finally, a key survival tip is to organize together to combat climate change.
