Greenpeace is collaborating with the Italian textile district of Prato to advance our Detox campaign. This initiative targets the suppliers for major brands, including Gucci, Prada, and Armani.

In a significant move, twenty companies have already joined the effort. They are committed to eliminating hazardous chemicals that harm health, such as PFCs, flame retardants, organotin compounds, and amines from azo dyes. To support this, Confindustria Toscana Nord is investing in tracking, transparency, and the development of action plans to detoxify products.

The actions taken in Prato are influencing global supply chains and setting a new standard for the industry, challenging brands to follow their lead. We are urging more companies to pledge to the Detox campaign by 2020. We also call on consumers to demand chemical-free fashion. This collaboration brings hope for a future with cleaner air and rivers.
