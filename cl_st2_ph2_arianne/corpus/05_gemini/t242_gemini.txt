For 50 years, Greenpeace has engaged in music collaborations, a history that began with a 1970 benefit concert. That event featured Joni Mitchell and James Taylor and was organized to fund the first expedition against nuclear tests.

Throughout the 1980s, this work continued with projects like the 1989 Soviet album, "Greenpeace: Breakthrough," which included artists such as U2 and Sting. The 1990s were marked by anti-nuclear concerts.

Modern efforts have included Ludovico Einaudi's 2016 performance in the Arctic and a 2018 ocean track from Thom Yorke. In 2017, the Save Our Sounds project saw nature recordings remixed into an album titled "Soundtrack to the Future." Through these collaborations, music inspires global action for environmental justice.
