The Salish Sea, a biologically diverse ecosystem spanning the coastal waters off British Columbia and the US northwest, supports over 200 species of birds and mammals. This area now faces risks from the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion, which will increase tanker traffic sevenfold. These tankers will be carrying tar sands oil, heightening the dangers of noise pollution and oil spills.

Several species are highlighted as being at risk. The giant Pacific octopus, known for its size and speed, is threatened. Endangered southern resident orcas face threats from both noise and potential spills. Clever sea otters are vulnerable to oil. Other species at risk in the Salish Sea include migrating grey whales and record-holding leatherback turtles.
