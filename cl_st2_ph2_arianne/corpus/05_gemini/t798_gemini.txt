Today, on International Human Rights Day, we are leading up to the 70th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. This is a moment to highlight that climate change is a human rights crisis.

Fifty major investor-owned carbon producers have caused 16% of the global temperature rise and 11% of the sea level rise from 1880 to 2010. In the Philippines, a national inquiry, initiated by survivors of Typhoon Haiyan and supported by Greenpeace, is investigating these companies' responsibility for climate-related human rights abuses.

We urge these companies to attend a meeting in Manila on December 11th. Amid global legal actions, we call for public support to demand climate justice and a shift to 100% renewable energy.
