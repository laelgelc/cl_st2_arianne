After 21 years of advocacy alongside various groups, Greenpeace Mexico is celebrating a monumental victory for our food and our planet. Mexico's presidential decree of December 31, 2020, officially prohibits transgenic corn and initiates a phase-out of glyphosate, to be completed by 2024.

This decision is a direct response to the threats posed by GMOs and glyphosate, which carry health risks, contaminate our ecosystems, and endanger agricultural diversity. The decree immediately bans the use of glyphosate in government programs and halts the use of GM corn in the nation's diet until sustainable alternatives can be implemented.

The goal is to achieve food sovereignty by building sustainable agri-food systems that produce healthy, environmentally friendly food. For Mexico, the place of origin for 59 types of corn and other essential crops, this is a critical step. The nation must now advance ecological agriculture to protect its rich biodiversity and heritage. We are moving toward a future that is free of pesticides and GMOs, and where the privatization of seeds is prevented.
