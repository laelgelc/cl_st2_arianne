Humanity has now breached four of the nine ecological boundaries that are critical for our planet's stability. Among these is the boundary for nutrient cycles, which we have pushed past its safe limits. Each year, our watersheds are overloaded with 8.5 million tonnes of phosphorus and 54 million tonnes of nitrogen, primarily from agriculture and runoff. This massive influx of nutrients is causing severe ecological damage, including eutrophication, the creation of dead zones, and mass die-offs in vital bodies of water like Lake Erie and the Baltic Sea.

The natural nitrogen cycle is a balanced system where bacteria fix atmospheric N2 for plants, a process historically aided by practices like crop rotation and the integration of animals. However, human activities have now doubled the inputs into this cycle. This has not only increased emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) but has also led to the acidification of soils and a reduction in biodiversity.

To address this crisis, we must change our practices. Solutions include sparing the use of fertilizer, properly managing manure, and employing bioremediation techniques using plants and fungi to clean up affected areas. Ultimately, we must focus on restoring natural ecosystems to bring our impact back in line with nature's limits.
