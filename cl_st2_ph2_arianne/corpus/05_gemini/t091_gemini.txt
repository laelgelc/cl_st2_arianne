In the polluted Wentworth community, located within South Africa's South Durban Industrial Basin, ecological damage is linked to an increase in gender-based violence and femicide (GBVF). This situation is exacerbated by climate change, which has its roots in patriarchal colonialism.

Pollution originating from factories and refineries in the area aggravates gender inequalities, poverty, and the risks posed to womxn and girls. The prevalence of male-dominated employment in the region serves to perpetuate these economic disparities.

A call has been made for an intersectional approach to address these interconnected issues. This involves integrating just energy transitions into GBVF policies. Such a strategy aims to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals and contribute to the dismantling of systems of oppression.
