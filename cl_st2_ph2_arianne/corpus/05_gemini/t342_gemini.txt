Focusing solely on shark fin soup misrepresents why 100 million sharks are killed annually. This immense pressure has already caused a 70% decline in shark populations over the past 50 years. The bigger picture reveals a $1 billion global market driven by demand for shark meat, oil, and cartilage.

This trade is fueled by destructive fishing practices like purse seine nets, longlines, and trawling. It is a global issue, involving countries such as France, Spain, Iran, Sri Lanka, South Korea, Japan, China, and the US. To blame one dish unfairly targets certain groups while ignoring the widespread nature of the problem.

Sharks play a vital role in maintaining ocean health. To protect them, we need comprehensive solutions, including the implementation of catch limits, the creation of global sanctuaries, and stronger import regulations. A key goal must be the protection of 30% of the world's oceans by 2030. Greenpeace is working to raise awareness of this complex threat and the urgent need for action.
