Economist William Nordhaus has been critiqued for dismissing the *Limits to Growth* study and underestimating the impacts of climate change. His approach relies on a Damage Function, which predicts only minimal GDP losses even from significant levels of warming. This model has been criticized for ignoring crucial factors such as ecological tipping points, the fundamental role of energy, and broader ecological complexities.

Critics like Steve Keen and Nicholas Stern have labeled his models as absurd and unscientific. They argue that the models are inherently biased toward economic growth while discounting the well-being of future generations and the poor. This economic thinking is linked to growing wealth inequality, a system where the rich benefit from neoliberal economics that rationalizes environmental plunder. Ultimately, it is humanity and the natural world that suffer the consequences of this approach.
