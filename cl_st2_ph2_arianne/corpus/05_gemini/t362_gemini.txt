On the International Day of Women and Girls in Science, we must acknowledge the gender inequality that persists in the field. Women comprise less than 30% of researchers, and only 7% of 15-year-old girls aspire to technical professions.

Women scientists are vital to Greenpeace campaigns, contributing to our work on climate change, ocean protection, and understanding the links between COVID-19 and biodiversity. Scientist Sandra Myrna Díaz uses a tapestry metaphor to explain that the loss of biodiversity increases the risks of disease transmission.

An upcoming expedition on our ship, the Arctic Sunrise, will be led by scientist Kirsten Thompson. The team will study the coral reefs, seagrass meadows, and marine life of the Saya de Malha Bank. They will use methods including eDNA, photography, and acoustic monitoring. The goal of this research is to advocate for a Global Ocean Treaty that would protect 30% of the world's oceans by 2030, a mission that emphasizes women's empowerment.
