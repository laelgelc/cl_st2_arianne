The "Net Zero" pledges being made are deceptive and insufficient for tackling the climate crisis. They are built on the assumption that emissions can simply be offset by carbon removal somewhere else, but this ignores fundamental realities. There are limited resources, such as the land needed for reforestation, and it overlooks the permanence of fossil carbon once it has been released into the atmosphere.

This system allows cheap carbon credits to enable business-as-usual for corporations, continuing their polluting practices while creating an unjust burden on marginalized communities.

Instead of this flawed approach, we must demand separate and transparent targets. We need rapid reductions in emissions from fossil fuels and industry. We also need rapid reductions in land-use impacts, which include deforestation and the production of meat and dairy. Alongside these reductions, there must be a commitment to rights-based nature protection.

The priority must be immediate cuts to fossil fuels, not a reliance on unproven technologies like Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS). To avoid dangerous tipping points, collaboration across all parts of society is essential.
