Greenpeace's Arctic Sunrise has conducted a four-month voyage in the Indian Ocean to investigate destructive fishing and research ecosystems, highlighting stories from Mauritius, Seychelles, and Madagascar. The region faces threats from industrial fishing, pollution, and climate breakdown, which are harming wildlife, ecosystems, and the livelihoods of local communities.

To amplify the voices of those on the front lines, the Vital Ocean Voices project has been introduced. The project provides grant support to local individuals and NGOs, enabling them to share their firsthand accounts. These stories are being told through various mediums, including writing, videos, animations, and poems.

Examples of these accounts include Kylian's story of responding to an oil spill, Madame Kokoly's experiences with fishing, and Aurelie's personal connection to the ocean. The project also showcases efforts like mangrove rehabilitation in Seychelles and the environmental actions being taken by school pupils.
