At COP25, the first intercontinental meeting of Climate Strikers is taking place, with representatives from the global north and south gathering from each continent. The goal is to amplify youth voices in climate policy decisions. While past conferences have excluded young people, this one will be different.

Strikers are initiating actions, including a press conference on Wednesday and a climate march in Madrid on Friday, which will feature Greta Thunberg. Despite ongoing strikes, governments have ignored the calls for change. This has prompted the continuation of youth action. They are demanding system change, radical measures to limit warming to 1.5°C, and solidarity for climate justice.
