A UN report by Special Rapporteur Hilal Elver has defined pesticides as a global human rights concern, directly harming the right to food. The report debunks the myth that pesticides are essential to feed the world. It states that the "Green Revolution" enriched corporations while causing food waste, hunger, climate change, biodiversity loss, and inequality.

The report is critical of corporations for their double standards and unethical marketing. It highlights their denial of the harms caused by their products, which are responsible for 200,000 poisoning deaths annually. These corporations also influence governments in order to obstruct reforms.

As a sustainable solution, the report points to agroecology. It recommends a binding international treaty on hazardous pesticides, the setting of national reduction targets, and the education of civil society on the benefits of agroecology. To achieve this, politicians must act to end corporate influence.
