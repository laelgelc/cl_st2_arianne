This month, the Greenpeace ship Arctic Sunrise is in the Indian Ocean to document and expose the threats our oceans face. This region is home to diverse wildlife and ecosystems, including pygmy blue whales, dugongs, colorful coral reefs, and the world's largest seagrass meadow.

The ocean is a vital lifeline for millions of coastal and island residents who depend on it for their food and livelihoods. But industrial fishing and climate breakdown are depleting this precious marine life.

Governments worldwide must act to protect the oceans. Join the journey.
