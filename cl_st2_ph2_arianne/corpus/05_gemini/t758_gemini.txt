In Canada, Indigenous leaders and supporters are resisting Kinder Morgan's tar sands pipeline. They are building a "Watch House" near the pipeline's route and engaging in protests. Over 10,000 people have marched, and 170 have been arrested.

This pipeline, which lacks Indigenous consent, is designed to transport polluting bitumen. Its operation would increase supertanker traffic, threatening endangered orcas, and would create the risk of spills that could contaminate water.

Protesters are drawing parallels to the resistance at Standing Rock. During that struggle, violence occurred, and ETP filed a $900 million SLAPP suit against Greenpeace and others in an attempt to suppress dissent. However, this action has strengthened the movement.

Greenpeace reaffirms its commitment to protecting the coast.
