Burning fossil fuels creates air pollution that harms our health and drives climate change. Coal is the worst offender, releasing high amounts of CO2, toxins like mercury and arsenic, and soot. This soot affects our hearts and lungs and increases the risk of stroke. Despite these dangers, coal is still used to power over a third of global electricity. We must shift to renewables like wind and solar, and encouragingly, recent progress has been made in this area.

For cars, petrol and diesel engines emit both CO2 and nitrogen dioxide (NO2). The solution involves creating more car-free urban options, such as reliable public transport and cycling infrastructure. While electric vehicles can help, they must be powered by renewable energy. To be truly sustainable, they should also be made smaller and be part of sharing systems.

Community action is vital for driving this transition. We have seen powerful examples of what happens when people mobilize for change. In China, community efforts led to the introduction of electrified buses. In Belgium, mobilization resulted in car bans, and in Turkey, it led to the closure of coal plants. These successes show that collective solutions are the way forward.
