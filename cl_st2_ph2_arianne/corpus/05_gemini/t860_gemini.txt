Protecting biodiversity is critical to maintaining a habitable planet. The decline is alarming, with a forecasted two-thirds drop in animal species by 2020 from 1970 levels.

Governments must be urged at the Cancun CBD summit to admit their failures and commit to bold protections. In 2010, they made pledges for 2020 that have gone unfulfilled. A commitment to protect 10% of the ocean has fallen short, with only 3% currently protected. Pledges for sustainable forest management also remain unfulfilled.

Vast areas like the Great Northern Forest are threatened by logging, fires, and climate change. This forest is not only home to communities and species but is also the largest carbon store. It, along with places like the Arctic Ocean, needs bold protection. Public action is necessary to ensure the fair sharing of resources.
