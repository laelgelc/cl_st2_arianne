McDonald’s, KFC, and Burger King must oppose the destruction of the Amazon. Their supply chains are directly linked to the crisis, as they buy Brazilian beef and soya-fed chicken, which fuel the deliberate setting of fires to clear land for agriculture.

The Amazon's importance cannot be overstated. It is vital for regulating the global climate, storing carbon, and producing water vapor that influences rainfall. The forest is home to Indigenous Peoples and countless species. Its destruction leads to droughts, famines, heatwaves, and storms.

These fast-food giants have previously promised to end deforestation. However, they continue to source from destructive suppliers while their business models drive ever-increasing demand for meat. This inaction stands in stark contrast to their public commitments.

Given the global outcry, pressure from these corporations could be a deciding factor in forcing President Bolsonaro to protect the forest. They have the leverage to make a difference. Other major companies are already acting; H&M, Timberland, Vans, along with salmon producers and investors, are taking stands against products from Brazil. It is time for McDonald’s, KFC, and Burger King to do the same.
