In the conversation about environmental crises, there is often confusion between the role of individual actions and the need for systemic change. The truth is that both are essential, and they are deeply interconnected.

While individual efforts, such as using a tote bag or reducing meat consumption, will not immediately solve global issues, they hold significant power. These actions can empower people, help build resilient communities, and, crucially, inspire others to act. We have seen how the courage of individuals like Rosa Parks and Greta Thunberg can ignite broader movements.

It is important that we avoid shaming people for taking small steps. Instead, we should encourage the escalation of these personal efforts into powerful collective actions. This means coming together to demand corporate accountability and push for necessary policy changes from our leaders. For our survival, systemic shifts are vital. These are fundamental changes in our mindsets and our economies. The path forward requires combining our personal courage with a commitment to these broader responsibilities.
