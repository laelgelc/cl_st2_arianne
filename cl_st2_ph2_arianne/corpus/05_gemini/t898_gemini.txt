In the Indian Ocean, Greenpeace activists have disabled the high-powered lights on the Explorer II vessel using water-based black paint. This action was a protest against the vessel's fish-aggregating practices, which were potentially in breach of regulations. Following the action, such lights were banned.

The crew of the Esperanza has also been active, removing dozens of fish aggregating devices (FADs), offering support to local Malagasy fishermen, and confronting destructive fishing operations.

These efforts are part of a global campaign. Actions have included factory shutdowns in New Zealand and France, laser projections in Thailand, and matching barcodes to FADs. Thai Union tuna has also been cleared from shelves in multiple countries. The campaign is pressuring companies like Thai Union, and more actions are planned at retailers including Walmart and Sainsburys.
