One year after the 2020 Norilsk diesel spill in the Russian Arctic, Greenpeace Russia is highlighting that oil accidents continue to occur. Recent leaks have been noted in the Komi Republic and the Nenets region. To promote transparency, the organization has mapped oil storage facilities located in the Arctic.

While inspections by the state regulator Rostekhnadzor are a welcome step, Greenpeace is demanding increased monitoring. The organization calls for the phasing out of fossil fuels and a transition to renewable energy. A 2018 presidential decree had previously addressed the issue of aging infrastructure. For the 2020 spill, Norilsk Nickel paid a historic compensation of 150 billion rubles.

Currently holding the chair of the Arctic Council, Russia has an opportunity to lead a shift towards a green economy. The proposed Russian Green Deal presents a path to create jobs and reduce the frequency of spills.
