Record-breaking cold, ice, and snow have been seen across the Northern Hemisphere, impacting East Asia, Europe, and the US. In Texas and northern Mexico, these conditions led to power grid failures. These failures have been blamed on fossil fuels, not renewables.

This extreme weather is linked to the polar vortex, a swirling ring of cold air in the stratosphere. Due to Arctic warming caused by the climate crisis, the polar vortex is weakening and wobbling. This leads to more frequent extreme winters.

To address this, all fossil fuels must be phased out and a shift to 100% renewable energy must occur. Governments and corporations need to take urgent action. Commitments have been made by China, Japan, and Korea. The public is urged to participate in Greenpeace's campaign to drive this change.
