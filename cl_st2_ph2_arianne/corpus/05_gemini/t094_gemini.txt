At COP27, the first climate summit with a strong focus on food and agriculture, discussions on biodiversity remain uncertain. In the face of these challenges, Indigenous Peoples are demanding inclusion to protect the earth.

The conference is taking place amidst Africa's food crisis, driven by rising grain prices. A ministerial panel has highlighted the necessity of shifting from monoculture to agroecological solutions that support small-scale farmers and their communities. Despite this, polluting countries are delaying essential financial mechanisms for adaptation, mitigation, and loss and damage, effectively evading responsibility for their emissions.

There is a call for urgent action on several fronts. This includes establishing global funds and technical exchanges, ending deforestation and industrial fishing, and advancing the work of Article 6.8 and the Koronivia joint work on agriculture. To influence the outcomes of the upcoming COP15 biodiversity conference, it is vital to prioritize the involvement of Indigenous Peoples.
