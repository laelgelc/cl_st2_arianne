Fifty years ago, a small group sailed from Canada to protest a nuclear bomb test on an Alaskan island. This action inspired global movement and led to the founding of Greenpeace.

Tribute is owed to the early members who helped transform the organization from a local, predominantly male, and white group into the diverse, global organization it is today—one that tackles the root causes of environmental destruction. Past achievements include whaling moratoriums, the halting of nuclear testing, the establishment of the Antarctic Treaty, and a ban on dumping waste at sea.

In the face of the current climate change and biodiversity crises, which are enabled by profit-driven structures, there is a call for unprecedented unity and action. Hope can be drawn from the power of past movements to demand a green and peaceful future.
