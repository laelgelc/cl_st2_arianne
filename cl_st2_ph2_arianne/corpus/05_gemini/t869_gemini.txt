Following years of Greenpeace campaigns at CCAMLR, the world's largest marine protected area has been created in Antarctica's Ross Sea. Covering 1,550,000 km², most of this area will be fully protected for the next 35 years. This is a victory for wildlife and for all the supporters who made it happen.

This achievement comes amid other recent ocean protections, such as the expansions in Papahanaumokuakea and the creation of new monuments. Now, the focus must turn towards establishing high seas sanctuaries through action at the United Nations. The goal is to secure 40% ocean protection by 2030, a necessary step to boost biodiversity and build resilience. To succeed against fishing interests, continued public mobilization is crucial.
