Greenpeace advocates for affordable clothing that is free from hazardous chemicals. In 2011, we launched the Detox My Fashion campaign and, in 2012, suspended the sale of our own textile products until we could secure transparent proof of chemical-free production.

Since then, 80 companies have committed to eliminating hazardous chemicals by 2020. Our "Destination Zero" report has highlighted progress in transparency and supply chain improvements, sparking further initiatives within the industry. A pilot project in 2018 demonstrated that Detox-compliant production is indeed feasible.

Building on this, from April 2019, Greenpeace is trialing a new standard for merchandise like t-shirts and bags with selected suppliers. This standard uses best practices and third-party tools to ensure both the elimination of hazardous chemicals and full transparency. While this trial is a significant step, our suspension on textile product sales remains broadly in place.
