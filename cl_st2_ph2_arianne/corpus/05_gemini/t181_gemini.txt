I recall my childhood in the Philippines, where we reused glass Coca-Cola bottles and refilled canisters at local stores. This system fostered community pride. This is a stark contrast to the current landscape of plastic pollution, fueled by single-use packaging from brands like Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, Nestlé, and Unilever. This plastic contributes to climate change because it is derived from fossil fuels.

The blame for this crisis lies with corporate overproduction, not individuals. While there is a global plastics treaty underway and Coca-Cola has set a goal for 25% reusable packaging by 2030, this is not enough. We must demand stronger commitments. Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, and Nestlé must adopt a 50% reusable packaging goal. It is essential that people reject greenwashing and push for a genuinely plastic-free future.
