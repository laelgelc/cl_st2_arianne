On the seventh anniversary of the Fukushima nuclear accident, Greenpeace expresses its sympathies and highlights the ongoing radiation risks. In contaminated areas such as Namie and Obori, hot spots have been found that exceed safe levels. These hot spots could potentially expose people to their annual radiation limits in a matter of days.

The Japanese government has plans to reopen these zones by 2023. This move is intended to facilitate the restart of nuclear reactors, even though high levels of contamination are expected to persist for decades.

Evacuee Mrs. Mizue Kanno has shared her story of displacement. She has become an activist against nuclear power and has joined lawsuits against both TEPCO and the government.

A survey report from Greenpeace underscores the necessity for precautions in these areas. There are upcoming UN sessions and court rulings that aim to enforce human rights and promote renewable energy.
