My home, Karimun Jawa in Indonesia, is a national marine park. It is a place rich with turtles, sharks, and fish. I am a lifelong fisherman here. In the past, we could catch abundant fish right near our homes.

Now, coal barges have come. They pollute our ocean with black runoff. Their smoky fumes fill the air, causing people to cough and vomit. When these barges anchor, they destroy the coral reefs, our fishing traps, and our bait. Their presence scares the fish away, and at night, their bright lights attract the cuttlefish that we, the local fishers, used to catch.

We have complained to the authorities, but nothing changes. The livelihoods of our families are threatened. The pristine nature of this area, which should be preserved for future generations, is being harmed. We must stand against these destructive barges.
