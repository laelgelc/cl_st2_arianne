Having moved to Australia from a landlocked country when I was 13, I have come to know the natural wonders of the Great Australian Bight. At places like the Point Labatt Lookout, you can see endangered Australian sea lion pups as they play and learn. Their breeding sites are fragile and highly sensitive to disturbances.

I have also seen the leafy sea dragons, which are perfectly camouflaged in the seagrass but are endangered by pollution, and the ancient granite formations of Murphy’s Haystacks. As an ocean photographer, I feel a duty to warn of the threats this region faces from oil drilling and seismic blasts proposed by Statoil. These actions could harm marine life that relies on sound, like dolphins and cuttlefish. Through the images from my explorations, I share what is at stake.
