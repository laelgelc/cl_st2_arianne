In the Indian Ocean, Greenpeace activists aboard the Esperanza confronted the Explorer II, a vessel operating within Thai Union's supply chain. Our activists blacked out the ship's 80 high-powered lights using eco-friendly paint. We then pursued the vessel after it fled from the Coco de Mer seamount.

This ship anchors and uses its powerful lights to attract marine life, which allows fishing vessels to then net the gathered sea life indiscriminately. The Explorer II is owned by the Albacora Group and is known to supply brands like John West. This action is part of a wider effort, as for weeks our activists have been removing similar types of destructive fishing gear.

A recent summit has banned the use of such lights, highlighting the harm that overfishing causes to our oceans and to the communities that rely on them. We must urge a movement for change.
