Greenpeace campaigns for a future free from toxics by working to eliminate chemicals that are persistent, toxic, bioaccumulative, carcinogenic, and hormone-disrupting. While there are hopeful signs, including increased company transparency, regulations like REACH, and the use of substitutions in some industries, the pace of change needs to accelerate.

To reassess the Detox strategy, Greenpeace's Science Unit at Exeter University conducted a two-year research project. This research focused on sectors such as electronics, toys, cosmetics, household products, and textiles. It specifically examined six chemical groups: PFCs, phthalates, heavy metals, BPA, BFRs, and APs/APEs.

The project compiled a list of more than 17,000 potentially hazardous chemicals. Through an analysis of supply chains, the research revealed the existence of widespread toxic pollution, which is caused by a lack of transparency and information. This open research is being shared to support broader detoxification efforts.
