This year, consider adding some eco-friendly New Year's resolutions to your list.

You can demand that governments build cities with bike lanes and affordable public transportation, and call for them to phase out fossil fuel cars to ensure clean air for everyone. You can also take personal action by choosing to bike or use public transport, which helps reduce emissions and can improve your health.

Another way to make a difference is by volunteering with Greenpeace. This could involve participating in activism like marches or even occupying oil rigs.

Changes in your diet can also have a significant impact. By reducing your consumption of meat and dairy, you can help cut greenhouse gases. A shift towards more plant-based diets can also boost your health.

Finally, you can resolve to reject single-use plastics to combat pollution. As part of this, you can urge companies like Coca-Cola and Nestlé to adopt sustainable packaging for their products.
