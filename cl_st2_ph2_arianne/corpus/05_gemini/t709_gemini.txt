An updated Census of Earth’s Biomass has revealed the extent of humanity's disruption of species diversity, driven by habitat loss, deforestation, and extinctions.

The census shows that plants dominate our world, accounting for over 80% of global biomass, most of which is terrestrial. In contrast, animals comprise just 0.37% of life's total mass. Within this small fraction, arthropods alone make up half of all animal mass.

The imbalance is particularly stark among mammals. Humans and the livestock we raise now constitute 96% of all mammal biomass, far exceeding the mass of all wild mammals combined.

Since the beginning of agriculture, human activities have halved the planet's total biomass. Fish stocks have been depleted by 85-90%, and 70% of the world’s forests have been destroyed. Furthermore, the use of pesticides has led to declines in insect populations. To preserve biodiversity, it is urgent that we halt the destruction of habitats.
