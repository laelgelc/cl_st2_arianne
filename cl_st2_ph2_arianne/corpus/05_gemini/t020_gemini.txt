Corporations are using a tactic known as SLAPPs, or Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation, to intimidate and silence environmental defenders. These are meritless lawsuits designed specifically to drain the time and resources of those they target.

Reports have documented 355 of these global SLAPP cases since 2015, with a majority occurring in the Global South. The fossil fuel industry has been a significant user of this strategy, targeting over 150 entities. The fundamental goal of these lawsuits is to suppress dissent.

In response, anti-SLAPP efforts are underway, including a proposed federal bill in the US and a directive in the EU. At Greenpeace, we have experienced this tactic firsthand and recently celebrated a court dismissal of a $100 million lawsuit filed against us. To help others facing similar challenges, we have shared our anti-SLAPP toolkit, which emphasizes the importance of raising awareness, funds, and voices to combat these legal threats.

Ultimately, SLAPPs are a serious issue because they threaten free speech and public participation, which are essential for a healthy democracy and environmental protection.
