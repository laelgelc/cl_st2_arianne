On August 19, we celebrate World Photography Day, and it brings to mind Robert Capa's advice: if your pictures aren't good enough, you're not close enough. As Greenpeace International's Multimedia Editor in Hong Kong, I see how photography has a profound nature that is simultaneously personal and public.

Photography's origins are in the 19th century, bearing witness through landscapes and portraits. For over 200 years, images have served as evidence in court and have inspired action. As a powerful ally to environmental movements, photography communicates universally.

This post features 12 iconic Greenpeace images. They include a turtle entangled in plastic, a bloodied whale which helped prompt whaling bans, oil-soaked pelicans, and scenes of deforestation in Indonesia. Also featured are images of protesters at Standing Rock and a woman victorious in her fight against a coal company.

We urge you to join the movement.
