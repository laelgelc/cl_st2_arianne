Our campaign to protect the Argentine Sea from the threat of offshore oil development continues. These projects overlap with the habitats of protected species, including the Southern Right Whale.

Despite a precautionary measure that had suspended these activities, a recent government resolution has approved the Environmental Impact Assessment submitted by the oil company Equinor. This decision violates the Escazú Agreement, which guarantees environmental rights and public participation. In response, we have submitted a formal letter demanding the annulment of this resolution.

We continue to stand with the ongoing protests, including the #Atlanticazo demonstrations, to voice our opposition. The company pushing for this development, Equinor, has a history of oil spills and leaks in its operations in Norway and Brazil. The dangers are clear: seismic explorations and potential spills threaten to cause immense ecological and economic disasters in our waters.
