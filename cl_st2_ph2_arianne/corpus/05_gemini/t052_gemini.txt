The climate crisis is causing increased rainfall and floods in Indonesia, which is impacting the nation's coffee production. This affects the small-scale producers who run 90% of the country's coffee plantations.

In Central Java, a women-run plantation called Lady Farmer Coffee is demonstrating a path forward. Founded in 2016 by Wiwi and two others, the initiative empowers female farmers who handle all stages of production from their 273 Sigarar Utang trees.

These farmers have been facing the direct consequences of the climate crisis, with excessive rain affecting tree growth, bean sweetness, and the crucial drying process, ultimately impacting the coffee's quality. Alongside these climate challenges, they have also contended with rising electricity costs.

In response, Lady Farmer Coffee installed solar panels with the help of the Diversity Movement, which includes Greenpeace Indonesia. This transition to renewable energy has reduced their coffee bean drying time by 40% and cut operational costs by 35%. The solar panels not only reduce emissions and help maintain product quality but also serve as a powerful example of promoting renewable energy and the important role of women in the industry.
