In September 2019, what became the largest global climate demonstration in history saw over seven million people protest for climate action in 180 countries. The movement was led by youth through groups like Fridays For Future.

The demonstrations took many forms around the world, including tag-teaming in Moscow, protected marches in Kabul, and protesters wearing plastic outfits in Nairobi. Events also took place across Latin America. A diverse coalition of groups joined in, from unions and NGOs to grandparents, teachers, and parents. The protests were marked by creative elements, incorporating color, banners, music, and dance.

Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the movement is adapting its strategy, shifting to digital strikes on April 24, 2020. The protests continue to demand green legislation, such as the Green New Deal. This message is being amplified through social media and technology, which are being used to foster global connection and debate.
