Following the Sanchi tanker's oil spill in the East China Sea, Greenpeace Japan Communications Officer, Akiko Tsuchiya, visited Amami Oshima to witness the impact as the oil reached its shores. She observed lumps of oil on the beaches and found an oil-soaked fishing net. The effects on wildlife were clear, with the discovery of a dead streaked shearwater and a sea turtle that was choking.

Although clean-up operations are underway to collect the waste, toxicity remains a threat in the sand and to marine life. Oil spills are an inevitable result of our dependence on fossil fuels. To combat threats facing our oceans, including overfishing and pollution, Akiko Tsuchiya urges people to reduce their consumption of petrochemicals like single-use plastics, to walk or bike more often, and to support renewable energy.
