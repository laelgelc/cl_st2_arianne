The climate crisis is a crisis of inequality and racial injustice. It actively exacerbates these issues, worsening the impacts on racialized communities through extreme weather, forced migration, and discrimination.

The roots of this exploitation are tied to slavery and ongoing colonialism. Today, extractive industries disproportionately harm people of color, polluting their air, water, and soil, which leads to devastating health issues and death. The very communities least responsible for creating the climate crisis are forced to face the brunt of its consequences, including floods, droughts, and displacement.

To find a way forward, we must center these communities in the solutions we build. This includes following the lead of Indigenous Peoples who are protecting forests from polluting industries like the fossil fuel sector. We must push for a just transition and a #FossilFreeRevolution.
