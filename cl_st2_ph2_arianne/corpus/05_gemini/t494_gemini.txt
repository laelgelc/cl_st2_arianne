Our oceans are a powerful ally in the fight against climate change. They work to keep our planet stable by absorbing billions of tonnes of carbon dioxide every year through two key processes. Firstly, microscopic organisms known as phytoplankton absorb CO2 from the atmosphere. As these organisms are consumed, carbon is transferred through the marine food chain, eventually sinking to the ocean depths where it is stored. Secondly, CO2 dissolves directly into seawater, where it is then carried by ocean currents and locked away.

Beyond carbon, our oceans also absorb an immense amount of heat. They have taken in over 90% of the extra heat generated by global warming, which helps to cool the land. However, this vital function comes at a great cost to the ocean itself. This absorption of heat and CO2 is causing acidification, harming marine life, supercharging storms, destroying reefs, and contributing to rising sea levels.

This reveals a critical connection: protecting our oceans enhances their ability to perform these climate-regulating processes. The creation of ocean sanctuaries, for example, helps safeguard these functions. In turn, tackling the root causes of climate change is essential for the health of our oceans. Their stability and our planet's stability are mutually interdependent.
