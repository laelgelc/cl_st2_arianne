The European Union is responsible for 22% of the world's historic emissions, and it is time for our leaders to act accordingly. The draft EU Climate Law, however, falls dangerously short of what is needed.

The current 2030 emissions reduction target is too weak; a reduction of at least 65% is necessary to have a chance of limiting global warming to 1.5°C. The draft law also fails to phase out subsidies for fossil fuels, a critical step in transitioning to a clean economy. Furthermore, it fails to address the 12-17% of emissions that come from animal farming, and it fails to set a 2028 deadline to ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars.

The funding proposed to tackle the crisis is also inadequate. The €1 trillion Sustainable Investment Plan is not only insufficient but could even be used to support fossil fuel projects, undermining its very purpose.

It is up to people across Europe to demand more. We must apply public pressure on our national leaders through marches and by contacting them directly. Our goal must be to strengthen the Climate Law and the wider European Green Deal, ensuring they address the root economic causes of this crisis.
