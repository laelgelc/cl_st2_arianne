The origins of Pride are rooted in protest. The 1969 Stonewall Riots were a stand against inequality, and this fight is linked to the pursuit of climate justice. Marginalized communities are the ones who suffer most from environmental crises.

We celebrate diversity and support LGBTQ+ rights as part of our work for a just future. Since 2018, Greenpeace has joined Pride events across the globe. We first marched in Amsterdam, and in 2019, we joined Pride in Brazil amid high rates of violence. We also participated in Mexico City, where equal rights laws are advancing, and marched in Taiwan in 2020 during the pandemic to emphasize the connection between social and environmental justice. We pledge our ongoing solidarity.
