A culture of extravagant consumption is creating a massive environmental problem, with annual electronic waste now exceeding 65 million tonnes. This crisis is driven by a system of planned obsolescence, where companies like Apple design products, such as iPhones, that are intentionally hard to repair. These corporations also actively lobby against right-to-repair laws, ensuring consumers are forced into a cycle of frequent replacement.

The life cycle of these devices begins with the destructive mining of minerals and ends with a tragically short lifespan, contributing directly to the growing e-waste mountain.

A Greenpeace report has graded electronics firms on their commitment to sustainability. While companies such as HP, Dell, and Fairphone received praise for improving the repairability of their products, others, including Samsung, were criticized for their poor performance.

To address this, we must shift from our current model to one of circular production. This change needs to be reinforced by government policies that mandate durability and repairability. Embracing more modest consumption habits is also crucial to reduce our ecological overshoot and support the vital growth of renewable energy.
