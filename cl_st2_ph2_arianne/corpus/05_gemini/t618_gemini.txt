August Maluka, a mobilisation officer for Greenpeace Africa, has been receiving phone calls from his sister in Beira, Mozambique, describing the aftermath of Tropical Cyclone Idai. She reports a rising death toll and the harrowing sight of bodies washing ashore. The city is without power, and residents are forced to wait in long lines for essential supplies like food and water.

Working as a volunteer relief worker, his sister describes a city gripped by pervasive grief. The streets are covered in mud, and with water access destroyed and sanitation poor, there are serious risks of a cholera outbreak. A vaccination campaign is being planned in response.

Despite the devastation, Maluka highlights the power of African resilience. His sister has seen communities coming together to support one another. Local boatmen are rescuing those who are stranded. It is in moments of catastrophe, he notes, that people’s true character is revealed.
