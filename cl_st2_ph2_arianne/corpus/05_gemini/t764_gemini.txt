My journey from Seoul to Antarctica was arduous, but it has been incredibly rewarding. Onboard Greenpeace’s Arctic Sunrise, I have witnessed stunning scenery, from penguin colonies gathered on pebble beaches to glittering ice floes.

Alongside this beauty, the impacts of climate change are visible. We are seeing the consequences of melting ice and the calving of the Larsen C iceberg, which pose threats to ecosystems and species like the specially adapted moss found here. The penguins, when seen in their natural habitat, appear strong, yet they are also fragile. This inspires a powerful desire to protect them.

Life on the ship has a daily rhythm of cleaning and meetings, and all of our activities are dependent on the weather. We also have to contend with seasickness. Our work here is vital. Greenpeace is conducting research using submersibles in the Weddell Sea, with the goal of identifying new species. This research supports the campaign for an Antarctic Ocean Sanctuary, which would safeguard the incredible wildlife here from the pressures of industrial krill fishing.
