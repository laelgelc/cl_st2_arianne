In the Caititu Indigenous Land, Chief Puraka and the Apurinã people value living in harmony with nature. This way of life is under threat from deforestation driven by agribusiness, an industry that consumes 70% of the world's freshwater and exacerbates water crises and extreme weather events.

This model of destruction-based economics disproportionately harms low-income communities. In deforested areas such as the state of Pará, the Human Development Index (HDI) is low. The situation is worsened by pending bills in the legislature that risk legalizing land invasions and undermining the rights of indigenous peoples.

There are, however, viable alternatives. These include socio-biodiversity chains, such as managed fishing and the collection of nuts, as well as agroforestry systems that revive traditional practices. Family farming also presents a path toward more inclusive production. The consequences of failing to adopt these alternatives are widespread, as reduced evaporation from the Amazon rainforest is already contributing to droughts across the continent.
