Monsanto has been accused of fraudulently promoting its Roundup herbicide as safe, despite evidence linking the glyphosate-based product to non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in farmers. Cases like that of Tralee Snape highlight the human cost of this alleged deception.

The accusations detail a systematic effort to distort the scientific record. This includes the use of falsified lab tests conducted by firms such as Craven Laboratories and the direct manipulation of scientific data. Furthermore, Monsanto is accused of ghostwriting favorable scientific reviews to create a false consensus about Roundup's safety, while also bullying scientists and agencies, like the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), that published critical findings.

In response to these actions, courts have awarded billions of dollars in damages to victims, citing the company's negligence and its cover-ups regarding the herbicide's health risks. The legal battles are supported by studies showing cancer risks, the presence of pesticide residues in food, and an associated nutritional decline in crops. It was amid these mounting liabilities that Bayer proceeded with its acquisition of Monsanto.
