Greenpeace has initiated a campaign focused on protecting the Amazon Reef. This unique biome, discovered in 2016, is located at the mouth of the Amazon River. It covers an area of 9,500 square kilometers, stretching from Brazil to French Guiana. The reef is characterized by its presence in low-light, muddy waters and features giant sponges and rhodolith.

The reef is currently threatened by oil exploration activities planned by Total and BP. These companies have drilling blocks situated just eight kilometers from the reef. A potential oil spill from these operations could cause harm to the ecosystem. Endangered species, including manatees, turtles, and otters, are also at risk.

In response, the Greenpeace ship, the Esperanza, is undertaking an expedition to the area. The mission will involve using submarines to explore the reef underwater. Through this campaign, Greenpeace is urging supporters to demand that the oil companies abandon their exploration plans.
