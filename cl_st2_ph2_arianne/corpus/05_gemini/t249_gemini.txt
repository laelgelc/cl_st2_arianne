From October 31 to November 12, the 26th UN Climate Summit, COP26, is taking place in Glasgow. It brings together governments, NGOs, businesses, and Indigenous groups for decisive climate action. Greenpeace is present to support frontline communities that are most affected by climate impacts.

Our demands include halting all new fossil fuel projects and halving emissions by 2030. We also demand the rejection of carbon offsets, which are scams, and that high-emitting countries provide at least $100 billion annually for adaptation and compensation in vulnerable nations.

There is a warning that carbon markets could derail progress. The focus must be on real emission reductions. Following the Paris Agreement and the latest IPCC report, COP26 plays a crucial role. Greenpeace is attending to advocate for the urgent changes needed.
