Every year, vast areas of Indonesia are shrouded in thick, choking smoke as fires rage across forests and peatlands. These fires are not only a health crisis for communities forced to breathe toxic haze; they are also a major source of carbon emissions driving the climate emergency. A central driver behind this destruction is the relentless expansion of palm oil, and the failure of major companies to turn their green promises into real change on the ground.

Despite public no-deforestation commitments, brands such as Unilever, Mondelez, Nestlé, and Procter & Gamble remain linked to large-scale forest and peatland fires. Greenpeace Indonesia campaigner Annisa Rahmawati has highlighted how these companies are connected to nearly 10,000 fire hotspots detected in 2019 alone. Between 2015 and 2018, suppliers in their palm oil supply chains were associated with around 200,000 hectares of land burned. Behind every hotspot and every scorched hectare are communities exposed to hazardous air, wildlife losing habitat, and vast quantities of CO₂ released into the atmosphere.

Many of these brands rely on major palm oil traders to implement their “no deforestation, no peat, no exploitation” (NDPE) policies. Yet the reality of how these policies are applied often falls far short of the public commitments. One of the most prominent examples is Wilmar, the world’s largest palm oil trader. Wilmar was an early adopter of an NDPE policy, but has failed to fully implement it in practice.

Wilmar initially suspended purchases from the supplier group GAMA (now known as KPN) after evidence linked it to serious deforestation. This move was presented as proof that NDPE policies were working. However, Wilmar later resumed buying from GAMA/KPN, despite ongoing concerns about the group’s record. This reversal shows how easily “no deforestation” commitments can be undermined when companies prioritize access to cheap palm oil over enforcing their own standards.

To try to close these gaps between policy and practice, Greenpeace engaged in collaborative monitoring efforts with Wilmar and other companies. The aim was to track deforestation risks in palm oil supply chains and push for real accountability. But these efforts broke down over a basic issue: transparency. When companies refused to agree to the level of openness needed to properly monitor and address deforestation, Greenpeace withdrew from the initiative.

Annisa Rahmawati and her colleagues are clear about what must happen next. Companies buying palm oil have a responsibility to ensure their supply chains are not fueling fires, haze, and climate breakdown. That means enforcing responsible sourcing policies rigorously, cutting off suppliers that continue to destroy forests and peatlands, and being fully transparent about where their palm oil comes from and how they address violations.

If companies are unwilling or unable to guarantee that commodities like palm oil are produced without deforestation, peatland destruction, or exploitation, they must be prepared to walk away from these high-risk supplies altogether. Anything less leaves Indonesia’s forests burning, communities choking on smoke, and the climate crisis accelerating.
