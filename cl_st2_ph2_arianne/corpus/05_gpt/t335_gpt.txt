The past few months have tested people everywhere. The global pandemic has reshaped daily life, introducing a “new normal” that few could have imagined. Many are facing uncertainty, isolation, and worry for loved ones. In the midst of this, hopes and prayers go out to everyone affected by COVID-19, along with a heartfelt wish for better days ahead and a speedy recovery for those who are ill. There is a shared belief that this difficult chapter will pass.

Lockdowns and social distancing have become part of everyday routines, keeping many indoors and limiting the freedom to explore the outside world. Weekend hikes, seaside walks, and spontaneous trips to new places have been put on hold. Yet, even as doors stay closed, imaginations do not have to. This is a moment to become armchair travellers—journeying in our minds and through stories, images, and memories.

From the safety of home, it is still possible to marvel at the Earth’s beauty. Snow-clad mountain peaks, standing silent and majestic. Vast oceans, their depths still largely unknown. Forests, deserts, rivers, and skies that stretch beyond the horizon. The planet’s landscapes and seascapes remain as awe-inspiring as ever, even if many cannot visit them in person right now.

Taking time to appreciate these wonders can offer comfort and perspective. It is a reminder that the world is still out there in all its diversity and splendour, waiting for the day when people can once again explore it more freely. Until then, celebrating nature does not have to be confined to a single day or a single moment. It can be a year-round act of appreciation.

Even in these constrained times, we can choose to celebrate the Earth’s beauty 365 days a year—by pausing to reflect on the places we love, by imagining the landscapes we hope to see, and by holding onto the sense of awe that nature inspires.
