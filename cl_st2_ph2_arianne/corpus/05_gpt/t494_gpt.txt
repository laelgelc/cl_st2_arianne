Healthy oceans are some of our strongest allies in the fight against climate change. They absorb huge amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2) and heat, helping to slow the warming of our planet. But this life‑support system is under serious pressure, and its ability to protect us depends on how well we protect it.

One of the ocean’s most powerful climate tools is microscopic life. Phytoplankton – tiny, plant‑like organisms floating near the surface – use sunlight and CO2 to grow. When they are eaten, the carbon they’ve absorbed moves up the food chain. Over time, as marine organisms die, much of this carbon sinks into the deep ocean, where it can remain locked away for long periods. In this way, healthy marine food webs help transfer carbon from the atmosphere to the ocean depths.

The water itself also plays a crucial role. CO2 from the air dissolves directly into seawater. Ocean currents then transport this carbon‑rich water around the globe and into deeper layers, storing billions of tonnes of carbon every year away from the atmosphere. Together, biological processes like phytoplankton growth and physical processes like seawater dissolution and circulation form a powerful natural system for carbon storage.

The oceans don’t just absorb carbon; they also take up heat. More than 90% of the extra heat trapped by global warming ends up in the sea rather than on land. This has helped to keep land temperatures lower than they otherwise would be. But there is a heavy price: warmer oceans are changing rapidly, with serious consequences for marine life and coastal communities.

As oceans absorb more CO2, seawater becomes more acidic. This acidification makes it harder for many marine organisms, such as shell‑forming species, to survive and thrive. At the same time, rising ocean temperatures are supercharging storms, fueling more intense weather events. Warmer waters are also destroying reefs, which are already under pressure, and contributing to rising sea levels that threaten coastlines around the world.

Protecting the oceans strengthens their ability to regulate the climate. Measures such as creating ocean sanctuaries can help restore marine ecosystems and support the natural processes that absorb and store carbon. Healthy, protected seas are better able to sustain phytoplankton, strong food webs, and resilient habitats that keep carbon moving into the deep ocean rather than back into the air.

At the same time, cutting greenhouse gas emissions and tackling climate change directly is essential for the oceans themselves. Reducing warming and CO2 pollution eases the stress of acidification, heat, and rising seas. The relationship is mutual: a stable climate depends on thriving oceans, and thriving oceans depend on a stable climate. Safeguarding both is critical for a safe and livable future.
