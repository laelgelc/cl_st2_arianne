The Amazon rainforest is under intense pressure from intentional fires and deforestation, driven by land grabbers, illegal loggers, miners, and cattle ranchers. Since 2019, these destructive activities have been emboldened by Bolsonaro’s anti-environment policies, which have weakened protections and oversight meant to safeguard the forest. As a result, deforestation has surged, and the Amazon is being pushed closer to an ecological breaking point.

Over the past 40 years, 17% of the Amazon has already been lost. Scientists warn that this level of destruction brings the forest dangerously near a tipping point, beyond which it could begin to collapse and gradually transform into a savanna-like landscape. Such a shift would have devastating impacts on biodiversity, threatening the countless species that depend on the rainforest’s complex ecosystems.

The consequences would also be profound for Indigenous communities, whose territories, cultures, and ways of life are deeply intertwined with the forest. As deforestation and fires advance, Indigenous Peoples face the loss of their lands, livelihoods, and the ecosystems they have protected for generations.

The global climate is at stake too. The Amazon plays a critical role in regulating the Earth’s climate, and its degradation undermines efforts to limit global warming. A forest that once absorbed and stored carbon could become a source of emissions if destruction continues unchecked.

Key drivers behind this crisis include agribusiness and meat production, especially cattle ranching. Forest is cleared for pasture and agricultural expansion, linking deforestation directly to the supply chains that feed global markets.

There are clear solutions. Enforcing existing environmental laws is essential to stopping illegal deforestation and holding those responsible to account. Expanding and properly managing protected areas can shield large swathes of forest from destructive activities. Recognizing and securing Indigenous lands is crucial, as Indigenous Peoples are among the most effective guardians of the rainforest.

Another vital step is eliminating deforestation from supply chains, particularly in sectors like meat and agribusiness that are closely tied to forest loss. Companies, governments, and consumers all have a role to play in demanding and implementing deforestation-free production.

Supporting the guardians on the frontlines is key. Indigenous communities and organizations such as Greenpeace are working to defend the Amazon, challenge destructive policies, and push for lasting protections. Backing their efforts is an important way to help ensure the world’s largest rainforest—and all who depend on it—can survive and thrive.
