Seven years after Super Typhoon Haiyan tore through the Philippines, the memory of that storm remains vivid and raw for Yeb Saño. In 2013, as Haiyan devastated his hometown, he was at the UN climate talks, trying to find words to describe a catastrophe still unfolding. The storm became a symbol of the human cost of a warming world, and of the urgency that climate negotiators too often fail to match.

In 2020, history echoed with chilling familiarity. Super Typhoon Goni, the strongest storm of that year, struck the Philippines amid a season of relentless typhoons. For Saño, Goni was not an isolated disaster but part of a pattern: a world where extreme weather is becoming more frequent and more destructive, and where those who have contributed least to the climate crisis are often those who suffer first and worst.

These storms in the Philippines are part of a broader global emergency. In recent years, wildfires have raged across Australia, Brazil, and the United States, consuming homes, forests, and livelihoods. At the same time, devastating floods have swept through East Africa, displacing communities and destroying crops. Together, these events form a stark picture of a planet in crisis.

Saño argues that while people everywhere are being urged to change their personal habits, the biggest drivers of the crisis are trying to escape their responsibilities. Fossil fuel giants like Shell are promoting narratives that shift the burden of emission reductions onto individuals, as if the choices of ordinary people alone could solve a problem created and sustained by an industry that has profited from pollution for decades.

He calls instead for real accountability—accountability that cannot be achieved through voluntary pledges or clever marketing. That accountability, he says, is being built from the ground up: through grassroots movements, youth climate strikes, fossil fuel divestment campaigns, and lawsuits that challenge corporate impunity. These efforts are pushing back against the idea that polluters can continue business as usual while communities are left to pick up the pieces.

In the Philippines, this push for justice has taken a powerful form. A human rights inquiry has been launched targeting major climate polluters, seeking to establish responsibility for the harms suffered by vulnerable communities. The goal is not only to recognize the rights of those on the frontlines of the crisis, but also to help drive a shift away from fossil fuel dependency.

For Saño, the path forward is clear: those who have caused and continue to fuel the climate crisis must be held to account. Only then can the world begin to address the damage already done, prevent future devastation, and build a safer, more just future for communities from the Philippines to East Africa, from Australia to the Amazon.
