Global military spending is spiralling upwards at the very moment the world most needs investment in health, social protection and a liveable planet. In 2019, governments spent an astonishing $1.9 trillion on their armed forces, a 3.6% increase in just one year. Instead of slowing down, this trend continued into 2020, with military budgets climbing further, including a 5.3% rise in the United States and a 10% increase in Germany.

The COVID-19 pandemic has thrown these choices into stark relief. While hospitals struggled with shortages of basic equipment, governments continued to pour money into weapons and war preparations. One comparison makes the distortion of priorities painfully clear: the cost of a single Leopard 2 battle tank is equivalent to the cost of around 440 ventilators. At the height of a global health emergency, that difference can mean the loss of countless lives.

The imbalance extends far beyond conventional weapons. Global budgets for nuclear weapons alone are ten times higher than the combined budgets of the United Nations and the World Health Organization. Instead of strengthening international cooperation and public health systems, vast sums are locked into technologies designed for mass destruction.

The pandemic has exposed how dangerous these misplaced priorities are. Decades of overspending on militarism have gone hand in hand with underfunded healthcare systems, deepening poverty and accelerating environmental destruction. A safer, healthier future depends on turning this around: shifting money away from weapons and war towards hospitals, universal healthcare, poverty reduction and the protection of the environment.

Reallocating even a fraction of global military budgets could dramatically improve access to medical care, support communities hardest hit by the crisis, and fund real solutions to the climate and environmental emergencies. It would also strengthen the international institutions tasked with preventing and responding to global crises.

This is why calls for a global ceasefire are so important. Ending armed conflicts and freezing arms races would free up resources urgently needed to save lives and build resilience. It would also send a powerful signal that human security is not built on tanks and warheads, but on healthy societies and a thriving planet.

People around the world are demanding this change. Campaigns such as #movethemoney and #Doves4Peace are calling on governments to cut military spending and redirect those funds to healthcare, social justice and environmental protection. Supporting these efforts is a concrete way to challenge the old logic of militarism and insist on new priorities that put people and the planet first.

The choice is clear: continue funnelling trillions into weapons, or invest in the hospitals, communities and ecosystems that sustain life. The COVID-19 crisis has shown how high the stakes are. Now is the time to move the money.
