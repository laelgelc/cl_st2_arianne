Environmental justice is not possible without social justice. The health of our oceans, our climate, and our communities are deeply connected to the systems of power that shape whose lives, stories, and rights are valued—and whose are erased. If we want a world where oceans and people can truly thrive, we must be willing to confront and transform the root causes of injustice, including racism, patriarchy, and entrenched inequalities.

Across the world, frontline communities are already leading this work, often at great personal risk and with very little recognition. Their struggles expose how environmental destruction and human rights abuses are intertwined, and how a “business as usual” model treats both nature and people as expendable.

On the West African coast, Senegalese women fish processors are standing up against industrial overfishing and destructive practices like transhipment at sea. These women depend on healthy fish populations for their livelihoods, food security, and cultural traditions. Yet industrial fleets, enabled by opaque and poorly enforced regulations, are stripping the ocean of life. Transhipment—where fish are transferred between vessels at sea—has been linked to serious human rights abuses, including forced labour and other forms of exploitation. The women resisting these practices are not only defending marine ecosystems; they are defending their communities’ right to exist with dignity and self-determination.

Their struggle echoes that of survivors of slavery in global supply chains, who reveal how exploitation of people and exploitation of natural resources go hand in hand. From fishing vessels to processing plants and beyond, many workers remain trapped in systems that depend on their invisibility. Their courage in speaking out challenges the idea that cheap products and endless consumption can ever be “sustainable” if they are built on stolen labour and stolen futures.

Marginalized communities living next to toxic facilities face another face of the same injustice. These communities—often poor, racialized, or otherwise excluded from power—bear the brunt of pollution, ill health, and environmental risk. Their homes and bodies become dumping grounds for industries that would never be allowed to operate under the same conditions in wealthier, more politically powerful neighbourhoods. This is not an accident; it is the predictable outcome of systems that treat some people as less worthy of protection.

These stories are frequently erased from mainstream environmental debates. Too often, decision-makers talk about “the ocean,” “the climate,” or “the environment” in abstract terms, without acknowledging the people whose lives are already being reshaped and harmed. When the voices of those most affected are sidelined, the solutions proposed tend to protect the status quo instead of challenging it.

Greenpeace is committed to helping change this. That means not only defending oceans, forests, and the climate, but also confronting the systems of oppression that drive environmental harm in the first place. It means amplifying the voices of those on the frontlines—like the Senegalese women fish processors, survivors of slavery in supply chains, and communities living in the shadow of toxic facilities—and standing alongside them as they demand accountability and change.

This commitment also requires deep listening and a willingness to learn from the upheavals of our time. The COVID-19 pandemic exposed and intensified existing inequalities, showing how fragile and unjust our current systems are. At the same time, global demands for racial justice have made it impossible to ignore how racism shapes who is protected and who is sacrificed—whether in hospitals, workplaces, or polluted neighbourhoods.

These crises offer a stark choice: return to an old “normal” built on exploitation and exclusion, or fight for a new normal in which thriving is a right, not a privilege. For Greenpeace, supporting those most impacted by environmental and social injustices is central to building that new normal. It means working in solidarity with communities whose stories have been ignored, challenging the powerful interests that profit from their suffering, and insisting that any vision of a healthy ocean or stable climate must also be a vision of a just and equitable society.

Environmental justice requires that no one is left behind. Social justice demands that we confront the roots of harm, not just its symptoms. When we bring these principles together, we move closer to a world where people and the planet can thrive together—and where every community, everywhere, has the power and the right to shape its own future.
