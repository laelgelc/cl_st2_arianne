The Ecological Footprint is a powerful tool for understanding how much pressure human activities put on the planet. It measures the amount of biologically productive land and sea needed to provide the resources we consume and to absorb the waste we generate. In other words, it shows whether we are living within the limits of Earth’s life-support systems—or far beyond them.

Today, we are in clear overshoot. Overconsumption is driving deforestation, overfishing, plastic pollution and escalating greenhouse gas emissions. Forests are being cleared to make way for industrial-scale palm oil plantations and meat production, destroying vital ecosystems that store carbon and support biodiversity. At sea, relentless overfishing is depleting fish populations and undermining the health of marine food webs. On land and in the oceans, plastic pollution is choking wildlife and contaminating ecosystems.

Our dependence on fossil fuels is a central driver of this crisis. Burning coal, oil and gas has pushed atmospheric CO2 levels to 421.21 parts per million. This level of concentration is increasing the risk of global warming in the range of 1.5–2°C. Such warming is linked to more frequent and intense extreme weather events, from heatwaves and droughts to storms and floods, with devastating impacts on communities and nature.

We are living in the Anthropocene, an era defined by the scale of human impacts on Earth’s systems. Our current trajectory threatens biodiversity, undermines the stability of the climate, and ultimately endangers our own survival. The Ecological Footprint makes this reality visible by showing that our demand on nature far exceeds what the planet can regenerate.

To change course, we must rapidly decarbonize our economies and phase out fossil fuels, shifting to renewable energy sources that do not destabilize the climate. Protecting and restoring forests is essential, both to safeguard biodiversity and to keep carbon locked away in trees and soils. Ending destructive practices like deforestation for palm oil and industrial meat is part of reducing our overall footprint on land.

Healthy oceans are equally vital. We need to protect marine ecosystems from overfishing and pollution so they can continue to provide food, store carbon and support life. Reducing plastic production and waste is a critical step to stop plastics from suffocating marine life and contaminating the food chain.

Empowering Indigenous Peoples is fundamental to building a sustainable future. Indigenous communities are often the most effective guardians of forests, oceans and other ecosystems, and their rights, knowledge and leadership are central to protecting the natural world on which we all depend.

Reversing ecological overshoot also means changing how we see ourselves in relation to nature. The Ecological Footprint reminds us that human well-being is inseparable from the health of the planet. Reconnecting with nature—through the choices we make, the policies we support and the movements we join—is key to building societies that live within ecological limits.

Every day must be treated as Earth Day. By understanding and reducing our Ecological Footprint, supporting renewable energy, defending forests and oceans, standing with Indigenous Peoples and demanding systemic change, we can move towards a future where both people and planet can thrive.
