Oil giants are pouring billions into new oil and gas drilling projects that would lock in decades of additional fossil fuel use. If these fuels are extracted and burned, the resulting emissions would push global heating beyond the 1.5ºC limit governments committed to in the Paris Agreement. That means even more destructive climate disasters – from deadly floods to uncontrollable wildfires – hitting communities that are already on the frontlines of the crisis.

Instead of changing course, companies like BP are pinning their climate promises on “future fixes” that simply do not add up. They are betting on large‑scale carbon capture technologies and vast tree‑planting schemes to “offset” the pollution from continued drilling and burning of fossil fuels. These plans are deeply risky. Relying on huge new plantations for carbon removal would demand enormous areas of land, creating serious threats to food production and raising major human rights concerns for people who depend on that land for their homes and livelihoods.

Scientists and energy experts have been clear that this approach is not credible. The IPCC and the International Energy Agency have both warned that large‑scale removals of this kind are unrealistic and cannot be treated as a license to keep expanding fossil fuel production. Counting on technologies and land‑hungry offsets that may never materialise at the promised scale is a dangerous distraction from the urgent action that is needed now.

To keep the 1.5ºC goal within reach and avoid the worst climate impacts, emissions must fall rapidly. That means no new fossil fuel projects and a managed phase‑down of existing oil and gas production, not further expansion. The billions currently being invested in new drilling should instead be redirected into clean, renewable energy and the solutions that can actually cut emissions today.
