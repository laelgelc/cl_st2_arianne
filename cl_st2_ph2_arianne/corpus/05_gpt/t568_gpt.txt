The Sargasso Sea, nestled within what is often called the Bermuda Triangle, is home to a rare and remarkable ocean ecosystem. Its clear blue waters and unique, endemic life make it unlike anywhere else on Earth. Yet even here, far from land, the growing crisis of plastic pollution is taking a heavy toll.

Greenpeace is setting sail on the ship Esperanza to document and confront this threat. The Sargasso Sea is ringed by ocean currents that act like a vast, slow-moving trap. Plastic waste from around the world is swept into these gyres and can remain there for years, breaking down into ever smaller pieces but never truly disappearing.

This plastic is deadly for marine wildlife. Turtles, whales, and fish can become entangled in larger debris or mistake floating fragments for food. As plastics are eaten and passed up the food chain, they don’t just harm individual animals; they enter the broader ocean ecosystem and ultimately our own food systems.

To give places like the Sargasso Sea a chance to recover, Greenpeace is calling for the creation of ocean sanctuaries under a strong new Global Ocean Treaty. These sanctuaries would protect vulnerable areas from multiple pressures at once, including overfishing, heavy vessel traffic, and the emerging threat of deep-sea mining. Just as a person needs rest to recover from illness, the ocean needs safe spaces where human impacts are reduced so life can heal and thrive.

But ocean sanctuaries alone are not enough if plastic keeps flowing into the sea. That’s why Greenpeace is urging people everywhere to demand an end to single-use plastics. By signing a petition and putting pressure on corporations to change how products are made, packaged, and sold, we can help turn off the tap of throwaway plastic that is choking our oceans.

The voyage of the Esperanza to the Sargasso Sea is both a warning and a call to action. Even the most remote and extraordinary places are now bearing the scars of our plastic addiction. Protecting them means supporting a strong Global Ocean Treaty, establishing ocean sanctuaries, and pushing companies to move beyond single-use plastics—before the damage becomes irreversible.
