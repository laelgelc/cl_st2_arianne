Modern slavery is not a relic of the past—it is happening now, on our oceans, hidden from sight and sustained by a global appetite for cheap seafood. Behind the fish on supermarket shelves and restaurant menus are workers, many from Indonesia and the Philippines, trapped in inhumane conditions that strip them of their rights, dignity, and often their hope.

Recent media investigations have exposed how migrant fishers endure extreme exploitation at sea. Many are lured by deceptive recruitment agencies that promise decent jobs and fair wages, only to find themselves bound to abusive employers and dangerous work. Economic desperation at home pushes them to take these risks, leaving families and communities behind in search of income that never truly arrives.

Once on board, isolation becomes a tool of control. A key mechanism enabling this is transshipment—the transfer of catch, fuel, and supplies between vessels at sea. Instead of returning to port, fishing boats can stay out for months, even years, cutting workers off from any chance to seek help or escape. This system allows forced labor and other abuses to flourish far from the eyes of authorities, journalists, or civil society.

Language barriers deepen the vulnerability of these fishers. Many sign contracts written in languages they do not understand, making it impossible to fully grasp the terms of their employment or the rights they are supposed to have. The result is a power imbalance in which companies and recruiters hold all the information—and all the leverage.

These abuses do not occur in a vacuum. Overfishing has pushed fleets to travel farther and stay longer at sea in what is known as distant water fishing. As fish stocks decline in coastal areas, vessels chase dwindling resources into more remote waters. The further they go, the weaker oversight becomes, and the easier it is for human rights violations to be hidden.

Greenpeace Southeast Asia’s report, “Seabound: The Journey to Modern Slavery on the High Seas,” brings these realities to light through the words of the fishers themselves. Their testimonials reveal a pattern of deception by agencies, crushing economic pressure, and systematic exploitation once they are at sea. They describe conditions that amount to modern slavery: endless work, isolation, and the constant fear of violence or retaliation if they speak out.

Governments bear a significant share of responsibility for this crisis. Too often, they fail to protect migrant workers, enforce existing laws, or hold abusive companies to account. Gaps in regulation and weak implementation allow unscrupulous actors to operate with impunity, while those who suffer have little recourse to justice.

On Human Rights Day, these stories demand more than sympathy—they demand action. Greenpeace Southeast Asia is calling on ASEAN member states to step up and confront the exploitation in their waters and supply chains. This means enforcing labor and fishing laws, ensuring that migrant workers are protected regardless of nationality, and closing loopholes that allow transshipment and distant water fishing to become vehicles for abuse.

It also means tackling discrimination that devalues the lives and labor of migrant fishers, and promoting ethical practices across the fishing industry—from recruitment agencies and vessel owners to buyers and retailers. Governments, businesses, and consumers all have a role to play in ensuring that seafood is not tainted by forced labor and human rights violations.

Modern slavery at sea thrives in the shadows. By listening to fishers’ testimonies and demanding change, we can help bring these abuses into the light—and push for an ocean where both people and marine life are treated with respect and protected by law.
