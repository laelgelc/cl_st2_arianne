The world is running out of time to keep the Paris Agreement goals within reach. To have a chance of limiting global heating in line with those goals, global greenhouse gas emissions must be roughly halved by the end of this decade. Instead of rapidly phasing out fossil fuels, however, a new scramble for oil and gas is unfolding across Africa.

Russia’s war in Ukraine has triggered a fresh rush by companies and governments to secure new fossil fuel supplies. In the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), this has taken the form of auctioning off new oil blocks that overlap with protected areas such as Virunga National Park and extend into vast, carbon‑rich peatlands. These are areas of immense biodiversity and critical natural carbon storage, and opening them up to drilling would come at a huge cost.

The risks are not just environmental. Many of these projects are moving forward without proper consultation with the communities whose lands, livelihoods, and rights are directly at stake. Expanding oil exploration into protected and peatland areas threatens to deepen existing human rights concerns in a country already facing multiple crises.

Africa’s oil also tends to have a particularly high carbon intensity. That means every barrel produced and burned adds more climate‑heating pollution than many other sources, further undermining global efforts to cut emissions. This is a stark example of climate injustice: people in vulnerable communities across the Global South, who have contributed least to the climate crisis, are already suffering the most from its impacts. From devastating floods to prolonged droughts, these communities are on the frontlines of a worsening emergency they did little to create.

The International Energy Agency has been clear that there is no room for new fossil fuel investments if the world is to stay within a livable climate trajectory. Continuing to open new oil and gas frontiers in Africa directly contradicts this scientific warning and pushes the Paris goals even further out of reach.

In this context, the role of the insurance industry is critical. Without insurance, large fossil fuel projects cannot go ahead. Insurers therefore have both a planetary responsibility and a clear business interest in ending support for new oil and gas expansion, especially in highly sensitive and high‑risk regions like the DRC’s protected areas and peatlands.

Insurers must move quickly to stop underwriting and investing in new fossil fuel projects, and to ensure that existing and past business has not enabled human rights abuses. Some major players, such as Munich Re and others, have already taken steps to limit or end their support for certain fossil fuel activities. These decisions show that change is possible and that the industry can begin aligning its practices with climate science and human rights.

To keep a livable future within reach, more insurers need to follow and strengthen this path: ending cover for destructive new fossil fuel projects, divesting from fossil fuel companies, and putting robust human rights safeguards at the core of their decisions. Anything less will lock in more warming, more injustice, and more risk for people and the planet alike.
