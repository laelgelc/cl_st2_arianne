Greenpeace Brasil, Climate Counsel, and Observatório do Clima, with the support of Greenpeace International, have taken a new step in the fight against violence and destruction in the Brazilian Amazon. They have jointly filed a Communication with the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC), asking for an investigation into mass human rights abuses in the region over the past decade as crimes against humanity.

The Communication is grounded in evidence collected through an online platform that documents over 12,000 conflicts in the Brazilian Amazon. These conflicts include 430 murders, 554 attempted murders, and 100,000 expulsions. According to the filing, these are not isolated incidents. Instead, they are described as part of a coordinated pattern of violence and dispossession.

The organizations argue that these abuses are orchestrated by a network of politicians, public officials, businessmen, and criminal actors. Their alleged objective is to dispossess communities of their land and open the way for the exploitation of natural resources in the Amazon. This systematic nature is central to the request that the ICC treat the situation as potential crimes against humanity.

The Communication also highlights the role of financial and corporate actors. It warns that those who aid or facilitate the network behind these abuses may come under scrutiny, including those who profit from or enable land grabbing and resource exploitation linked to the documented violence.

At the same time, the filing acknowledges the practical challenges the ICC faces, including limited resources and competing demands on the Court’s attention. Despite this, the organizations urge the ICC Prosecutor to act, emphasizing the need to end the longstanding impunity surrounding these abuses in the Brazilian Amazon.
