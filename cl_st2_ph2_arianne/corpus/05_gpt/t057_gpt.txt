The water came so fast that day in 2009 that Virginia barely had time to think. Typhoon Ketsana barrelled into San Mateo, Rizal, and within hours her home was underwater. Furniture, clothes, family mementos – all of it was soaked, ruined, or swept away. The flood didn’t just take things; it left behind a fear that still rises in her chest whenever heavy rain begins to fall.

Virginia remembers standing in the murky water, trying to salvage what she could, and realising that, despite the chaos around her, she was one of the lucky ones. Neighbours had lost far more. Some had lost everything. Others had lost loved ones. That contrast – between her own survival and the grief around her – stayed with her long after the floodwaters receded.

In the months and years that followed, she kept returning to the same questions: Why was this happening more often? Why were storms becoming more violent? And who was responsible for the damage being suffered by people who had done so little to cause the climate crisis?

Those questions eventually led her to organise a petition to the Commission on Human Rights of the Philippines. Alongside many others, she called for an investigation into the responsibility of major fossil fuel companies for climate impacts being felt in the Philippines. The petitioners argued that these companies had long known about the harm their products would cause, yet continued to mislead the public and obstruct the shift to clean energy.

The Commission’s landmark investigation concluded that fossil fuel companies could be held morally and legally liable for climate-related harms. It found that by spreading misinformation and blocking clean energy solutions, these corporations had contributed to the climate damage now devastating communities like Virginia’s.

For Virginia, this decision was not abstract. It was rooted in memories of muddy waterlines on her walls, the smell of damp clothes, the sound of neighbours crying over what they had lost. The ruling recognised something she had already lived: that climate change is not an accident, and that powerful companies bear responsibility for the suffering it causes.

Today, Virginia is a climate campaigner with Greenpeace. Her work brings her into direct contact with communities across the Philippines who are living on the frontlines of the climate crisis. Farmers tell her about crops failing more often, harvests shrinking, and the growing uncertainty of their livelihoods. Fishers describe how their catches have declined, cutting into already fragile incomes. Each story is another reminder that the people least responsible for climate change are paying the highest price.

These conversations deepen her resolve. The losses people share with her – fewer bags of rice, fewer fish in their nets, fewer pesos to cover school fees or medicine – are not isolated misfortunes. They are part of a pattern of injustice that stretches from flooded homes in San Mateo to parched fields and empty nets across the country.

That’s why Virginia has taken her fight far beyond the shores of the Philippines. She is now aboard the Greenpeace ship Arctic Sunrise, confronting one of the world’s biggest oil companies at sea. Together with others, she is blocking Shell’s operations and demanding that the company stop drilling for more fossil fuels and start paying for the harm already inflicted on communities like hers.

For Virginia, standing on the deck of the Arctic Sunrise is a continuation of the same struggle that began when Ketsana flooded her home. Back then, she waded through dirty water, trying to save what little she could. Now, she stands in solidarity with people around the world who are demanding that those most responsible for the climate crisis finally be held to account.

Her message is clear: the people who did the least to create this crisis should not be the ones carrying its heaviest burdens. Fossil fuel companies must stop fuelling further climate destruction and must pay for the damage already done to lives, livelihoods, and communities.
