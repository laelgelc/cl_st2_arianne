The Arctic sea ice has reached its second-lowest minimum since records began, a stark signal of accelerating climate breakdown. Scientists warn that if this trend continues, the Arctic could be effectively free of summer sea ice as early as 2035. This is not a distant possibility but a rapidly approaching reality, unfolding in real time.

Right now, Greenpeace’s ship, the Arctic Sunrise, is in the region, bearing witness to this crisis. The shrinking ice is not just a local issue; it is a global warning. The Arctic plays a critical role in stabilizing the climate, and its loss intensifies warming, disrupts weather patterns, and undermines the health of the oceans that sustain life everywhere.

Healthy oceans are powerful allies in the fight against climate breakdown. They store carbon and help build resilience against the impacts of a warming world. Protecting them is essential if we are to have any chance of stabilizing the climate and safeguarding biodiversity. The Arctic is one of the priority areas that must be defended if the world is to avoid the worst consequences of this crisis.

But the effects of ocean destruction are not felt equally. Marginalized communities, especially in the Global South, are already suffering the most from climate impacts and the degradation of marine ecosystems. These communities often depend directly on the ocean for food, livelihoods, and protection from storms, yet they are the least responsible for the emissions and policies driving this emergency.

This is why millions of people are coming together to demand change. More than 3 million have already joined the call for governments to protect at least 30% of the world’s oceans by 2030. This is a clear, science-backed target that could help restore marine life, support coastal communities, and strengthen the planet’s resilience.

World leaders gathering at the UN Biodiversity Summit now face a defining choice. They can continue with weak commitments and delayed action, or they can seize this moment to agree on strong protections for the oceans and the people who depend on them. The urgency of the Arctic sea ice collapse leaves no room for half-measures.

The call is simple and uncompromising: leaders must act now to protect our oceans and our shared future. This means securing at least 30% ocean protection by 2030 and treating the Arctic as the global priority it is. It means listening to the communities on the frontlines of ocean destruction and climate impacts, and putting their rights and needs at the heart of decision-making.

The situation in the Arctic is a visible sign of a planet under strain, but it is also a rallying point. With millions already demanding action, the pressure on governments is growing. The task now is to keep that pressure unrelenting—until commitments are made, and then to keep pushing until those commitments are turned into real protection in the water.

There is still a chance to change course, but it depends on what happens next. Protecting the oceans is not optional; it is essential to any credible plan to confront climate breakdown. The Arctic ice is disappearing fast. Our response must be faster.
