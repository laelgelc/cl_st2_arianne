I recently found myself far from my home on the Wild Coast of South Africa, standing on the deck of a ship in the icy North Sea. I had travelled there to support Greenpeace activists occupying Shell’s massive oil platform – a platform headed for new drilling that could extract up to 45,000 barrels of oil every day for more than 20 years.

We were on board the Merida, a vessel carrying international advocates united by a shared purpose: to challenge Shell’s plans to keep expanding fossil fuel extraction while communities and ecosystems around the world are already paying the price. From the moment I stepped onto the ship, I carried with me the voices and experiences of my community in Xolobeni and of many others in the Global South whose lands and seas are treated as sacrifice zones.

Shell responded to this peaceful protest with legal threats. The company obtained an injunction that means activists could face up to two years in jail simply for standing in the way of yet another oil project. The contrast could not be more stark: on one side, communities and defenders trying to protect their homes, oceans, and future; on the other, a fossil fuel giant using its power to silence dissent and push ahead with drilling that will deepen the climate crisis.

I know what oil and gas projects mean for people and nature because we have lived it in South Africa. Oil drilling and exploration tear apart communities, threaten livelihoods, and destroy biodiversity. They endanger fishers whose catches decline, tourism that depends on healthy ecosystems, and cultural and spiritual connections to land and sea. They also drive the climate chaos that is already hitting the Global South hardest, from storms and floods to droughts and failing crops.

On the Wild Coast, Shell tried to carry out seismic exploration in our ocean – blasting the water with powerful sound waves in search of oil and gas. Coastal communities, fishers, and activists came together to resist. We took Shell to court, and we won. A South African court halted Shell’s exploration plans on the Wild Coast, recognising the harm they would cause to people and marine life, and the failures in proper consultation.

That victory showed what is possible when communities stand together, but it did not end Shell’s global drilling ambitions. The same company that was stopped on the Wild Coast is now pushing ahead with a project in the North Sea that could lock in decades more of fossil fuel production. The impacts of that decision will not be confined to one country. More oil burned anywhere means more climate damage everywhere – and once again, people in the Global South will bear a disproportionate share of that burden.

This is why our struggle is connected, from Xolobeni to the North Sea. The fight against new oil and gas is not only about one coastline or one community. It is about defending our shared climate, protecting biodiversity, and insisting that big polluters take responsibility for the harm they cause.

Shell must stop drilling for more oil and gas. It must shift its business towards renewable energy instead of clinging to a model that destroys our future. And it must pay for the damages done to communities and ecosystems over decades of extraction and pollution.

You can help increase the pressure on Shell by adding your name to the petition demanding that the company end its oil and gas expansion, move to renewables, and pay for the harm it has caused. Every signature adds to the call from communities across the world who are saying clearly: no more sacrifice zones, no more empty promises, and no more new oil and gas.

Together, we can stand up to fossil fuel giants like Shell and push for a future built on justice, clean energy, and respect for people and the planet.
