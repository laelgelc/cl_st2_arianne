Every morning, Lucas wakes up fighting for breath. At just six years old, he suffers from allergic rhinitis, with constant nasal congestion, a runny nose, and almost daily nosebleeds. His mother, Margret, believes the air pollution from the heavy traffic outside their Hong Kong apartment is making him sicker.

From their home, traffic is constant. Margret wipes the windows multiple times a day, only to find them quickly covered again with a layer of black soot. To protect her son, she keeps the windows shut as much as possible, trying to keep the polluted air out. But even with the windows closed, Lucas continues to struggle.

Looking for answers, Margret and Lucas joined Greenpeace Hong Kong’s Citizen Science Research project. Together, they installed sampling tubes at their home to measure nitrogen dioxide (NO2), a pollutant closely linked to traffic emissions. When the results came back, they confirmed what Margret had feared: the air quality around their home was poor.

NO2 is known to irritate the mucous membranes, including those in the nose and throat. Long-term exposure can interfere with the healthy development of children’s respiratory systems. For a child like Lucas, already suffering from respiratory symptoms, this pollution adds an extra and unnecessary burden.

The problem is not limited to one apartment or one family. Last year, nine out of Hong Kong’s 16 monitoring stations recorded NO2 levels that exceeded national standards. These numbers reflect a broader reality: too many people in Hong Kong are breathing air that is harmful to their health.

Stories like Lucas’s show that air pollution is not an abstract issue; it is a daily, physical struggle for children and families living near busy roads. Hong Kong’s government has a responsibility to act. To protect public health, especially that of children, it must urgently curb the growth of private cars and accelerate the electrification of public transport.

By reducing traffic-related pollution, Hong Kong can help ensure that children like Lucas can breathe easier, grow up healthier, and live in a city where clean air is a right, not a privilege.
