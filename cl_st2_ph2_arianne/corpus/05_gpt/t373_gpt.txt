In 2020, climate emergencies intensified across the globe, exposing the deepening crisis of a warming planet and the urgent need for collective action. From storms and fires to floods and heat waves, communities everywhere faced overlapping disasters, often while still grappling with the impacts of a global pandemic.

In the United States, Hurricane Laura tore through communities, leaving a trail of devastation. The storm caused deaths and widespread power outages, plunging entire areas into darkness and disrupting lives and livelihoods. It was another stark reminder of how climate-fuelled extreme weather can overwhelm infrastructure and put the most vulnerable at greatest risk.

Far to the north, Siberia experienced alarming climate extremes. Unusual and intense heat waves swept across the region, contributing to oil spills and massive forest fires. These events not only destroyed local ecosystems and threatened communities, they also raised global concern about the stability of permafrost and the cascading impacts of warming in the Arctic and sub-Arctic regions.

In the Amazon, fires continued to rage, threatening one of the world’s most vital rainforests. The Amazon is crucial for regulating the Earth’s climate, and its destruction has direct consequences for global temperatures. As flames consumed forest areas, the world watched a critical carbon sink pushed closer toward a tipping point, with implications for biodiversity, Indigenous peoples, and the global climate system.

On the other side of the Americas, California faced prolonged and increasingly destructive fire seasons. These fires destroyed lives, homes, and ecosystems, leaving communities to cope with smoke-filled skies and the loss of forests and wildlife. Year after year, the lengthening fire season has underscored how rising temperatures and changing weather patterns are transforming the risks communities face.

Across the Pacific, the Philippines was hit by back-to-back typhoons. These powerful storms triggered severe floods and widespread displacement, forcing people from their homes and devastating infrastructure. In the aftermath, the destruction and human suffering added weight to growing calls within the country for a formal declaration of a climate emergency.

Even as the COVID-19 pandemic temporarily reduced emissions in some sectors, 2020 remained one of the hottest years on record. The apparent dip in pollution did not slow the underlying trend of global heating. Instead, the year was marked by overlapping climate disasters that underlined how deeply the crisis is already embedded in our daily reality.

Australia entered 2020 still reeling from catastrophic bushfires that had burned across vast areas, killing wildlife, destroying homes, and shrouding cities in smoke. These fires became one of the defining images of the year’s climate emergency, a symbol of how quickly conditions can spiral when hot, dry weather meets vulnerable landscapes.

Meanwhile, floods hit multiple countries, bringing deadly consequences and massive damage. In Kenya, Japan, China, Indonesia, and South Korea, heavy rains and rising waters led to loss of life and widespread destruction of homes, infrastructure, and farmland. These floods showed how water extremes—too much in some places, too little in others—are becoming more frequent and more severe in a warming world.

Taken together, the events of 2020 formed a global portrait of a planet in crisis. Fires, storms, heat waves, and floods converged with a pandemic to expose the fragility of our systems and the urgency of change. The year’s disasters underscored that climate change is not a distant threat but a present emergency, demanding collective action from governments, businesses, and communities to protect people and the planet.
