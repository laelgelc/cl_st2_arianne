Europe is running out of time to tackle the climate crisis, and the way we move is at the heart of the problem. The transport sector is responsible for more than a quarter of Europe’s CO2 emissions, and almost half of that – 45% – comes from road transport alone. Unless we change how we travel, we will miss the narrow window we have in the next decade to keep global warming in check.

Phasing out diesel and petrol vehicles is central to this transformation. Research by the Ecologic Institute and Greenpeace Germany lays out six key policy measures that can drive this shift and help rapidly cut emissions from transport.

First, governments need to set a clear end date for the sale of new internal combustion engine vehicles and back it up with binding production quotas for electric vehicles (EVs). This provides certainty for industry, accelerates innovation, and ensures that cleaner vehicles become the norm rather than the exception.

Second, public authorities must rapidly expand and subsidize charging infrastructure. People will only switch to EVs if charging is easy, affordable, and widely available – in cities, along highways, and in rural areas. Public investment and smart subsidies can close the gaps and make EV charging as straightforward as filling up a tank.

Third, incentives need to evolve with the market. Early on, generous support can help kick-start EV adoption; later, as EVs become more common and cheaper, incentives should be adjusted and better targeted. This avoids wasting public money and keeps support focused where it’s most effective – for example, helping low- and middle-income households make the switch.

Fourth, no single policy is enough. A mix of tools – such as subsidies, mandates, standards, and regulations – works better than any one measure on its own. Combining carrots and sticks helps overcome different barriers at the same time, from upfront costs to supply constraints.

Fifth, governments should make polluters pay while rewarding cleaner choices. That means higher taxes or charges on fossil-fuel vehicles and fuels, alongside financial advantages for EVs. Well-designed taxes and incentives can shift both consumer demand and manufacturer decisions, speeding up the transition away from diesel and petrol.

Finally, clear communication is essential. People need to understand not just what is changing, but why it matters and how it will improve their lives – from cleaner air and quieter streets to lower running costs and more stable energy prices. Transparent, consistent messaging helps build trust and public support for ambitious climate action in transport.

Electric vehicles are a crucial part of the solution, but they are not the whole story. The goal is not simply to replace every diesel and petrol car with an electric one. To truly cut emissions and build livable cities, Europe must also reduce the overall number of private cars on the road and prioritize alternatives: high-quality, affordable public transport powered by renewable energy, as well as safe and attractive infrastructure for cycling and walking.

The next decade is decisive. By combining a rapid phase-out of fossil-fuel cars with strong support for EVs and a broader shift towards public transport, cycling, and walking, Europe can slash transport emissions and move decisively toward a cleaner, fairer future.
