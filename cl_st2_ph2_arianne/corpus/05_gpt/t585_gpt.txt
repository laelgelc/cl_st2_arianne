Out on the open ocean, far from any coastline, it can feel like the sea stretches on forever. But for Greenpeace campaigner Will McCallum and the crew of the Esperanza, the illusion of endless abundance is shattered by the brutal reality of industrial shark fishing.

Sailing through a notorious fishing ground, they are in waters where up to 25,000 endangered sharks are killed every year. Most of these sharks are taken for their fins, and the scale of destruction is stark: sharks are being caught at four times the rate of swordfish. This isn’t a balanced fishery; it’s a one-sided assault on some of the ocean’s most vulnerable species.

From the deck of the Esperanza, the team watched a longliner vessel haul in its catch. Line after line came aboard, and with it, the evidence of a broken system. In a single haul, the longliner brought in eight sharks and just one swordfish. This is not an isolated incident but a snapshot of what is happening day after day, year after year, under the banner of “management” that is clearly failing to protect marine life.

Joining the crew is low-impact fisherman Jerry Percy, whose presence underscores that this is not only an environmental crisis but a social and economic one too. When industrial fleets decimate shark populations and other ocean life, coastal communities that depend on healthy seas for their livelihoods are left to pay the price. Small-scale, low-impact fishers are squeezed out by industrial operations that strip the ocean of life far faster than it can recover.

What the Esperanza is witnessing is a symptom of a deeper problem: the lack of effective, global rules to protect the high seas and the wildlife that depends on them. Sharks, already endangered, are being pushed closer to the brink in waters where governance is weak and enforcement is often absent.

Greenpeace is calling for a strong Global Ocean Treaty to change this. Such a treaty would put real limits on shark catches and create ocean sanctuaries—areas off-limits to destructive industrial fishing and drilling. These sanctuaries are not a luxury; they are exactly what scientists say is needed to give marine ecosystems a chance to recover and thrive.

The evidence from the Esperanza’s journey is clear: without strong global protections, industrial exploitation will continue to devastate shark populations and the wider ocean. A Global Ocean Treaty offers a path to safeguard endangered species, defend the livelihoods of coastal communities, and give the oceans the protection scientists are urgently calling for.
