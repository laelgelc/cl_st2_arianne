Across Kenya’s rural landscapes, smallholder farmers are raising their voices against a new law that threatens a cornerstone of their livelihoods and culture: the right to freely save, exchange and sell Indigenous seeds.

For generations, farmers have selected, shared and improved seeds adapted to local soils, climates and tastes. These Indigenous seeds are part of Kenya’s farming heritage and are not owned by large corporations like Bayer. They are the foundation of diverse, resilient fields that can better withstand pests, diseases and shifting weather patterns.

This tradition is not a niche practice. Studies show that 90% of seeds in Kenya come from informal systems, and 80% of smallholder farmers rely on these networks of sharing and exchange. In many communities, this is how people ensure they have enough seed each season, especially when commercial seeds are too expensive or unavailable.

Farmers like Petronilah Olunga save their own seeds precisely because of these costs. For her and many others, keeping and exchanging seeds is both an economic necessity and a way to maintain control over what they plant. They question why such a fundamental practice could be turned into a crime.

Under the new law, the exchange or sale of Indigenous seeds that are not registered can lead to severe penalties: up to two years in prison or a fine of KES 1,000,000. For smallholder farmers, these punishments are not just harsh; they threaten their ability to farm, feed their families and sustain their communities.

These restrictions come at a time of global biodiversity loss and mass extinction, when Indigenous Peoples and local communities (IPLCs) are at the forefront of defending ecosystems and protecting genetic diversity. Limiting their seed systems risks eroding the very biodiversity that is essential for climate resilience and food security.

In response, Kenyan farmers are organizing. In collaboration with groups such as Seed Savers Network and Greenpeace Africa, they are demanding meaningful consultation on laws that affect their seeds and their futures. They insist on the freedom to choose what seeds to grow and how to share them.

As farmer Samuel Wathome has voiced, this is about more than regulations; it is about farmers’ rights, autonomy and the survival of Indigenous seed systems that nourish both people and the planet.
