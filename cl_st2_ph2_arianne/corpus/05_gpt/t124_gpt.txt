Greenpeace East Asia’s latest investigation exposes a stark gap between Bumble Bee’s public promises on sustainability and human rights and the realities uncovered at sea and in its supply chain.

Central to Bumble Bee’s marketing is its “Trace My Catch” tool, which is supposed to give consumers confidence by allowing them to track where their tuna comes from. Yet the investigation found that this tool cannot be relied on to ensure that products are free from illegal fishing or human rights abuses. When Greenpeace East Asia traced Bumble Bee products and cross-checked the supplying vessels, serious problems emerged.

Out of 119 vessels identified as supplying Bumble Bee, 13 were found to have violated regulations and appeared on Taiwan’s official list for illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing. These vessels were associated with practices including shark finning and illegal fishing activities—exactly the kinds of abuses Bumble Bee claims its policies are meant to prevent.

The investigation linked one Bumble Bee product directly to the Taiwanese vessel Da Wang. This vessel has been at the center of a major forced labor and human trafficking case. On board Da Wang, a migrant fisher died following abuse. Authorities have since indicted those involved for forced labor and trafficking, underscoring the severity of the violations taking place in a supply chain that ultimately feeds the US seafood market.

Interviews with fishers added further evidence of systemic abuse. Workers reported excessive overtime and wages being withheld—classic indicators of exploitation at sea. These testimonies directly contradict Bumble Bee’s stated commitments to uphold human rights and decent working conditions throughout its supply chains.

The report warns that seafood sold in the United States is at risk of being tainted by both illegal fishing and labor abuses, despite corporate sustainability claims. Bumble Bee’s own policies and its traceability marketing are undermined when products can be traced back to vessels implicated in IUU fishing and forced labor.

At the heart of the investigation is the story of Manny, a migrant fisher who worked on Da Wang. Manny witnessed the fatal abuse of a fellow crew member and has since been seeking justice for what happened on board. His account brings a human face to the abuses hidden behind supply chain opacity and broken corporate promises.

The findings underline the urgent need for truly transparent, accountable seafood supply chains. Consumers increasingly support traceability, but tools like Trace My Catch must be backed by rigorous, independent verification and meaningful enforcement of human rights and environmental standards. Without this, traceability risks becoming a marketing façade rather than a safeguard for people and the oceans.
