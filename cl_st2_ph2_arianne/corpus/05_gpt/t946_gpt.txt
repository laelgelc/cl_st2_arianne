After years of legal battles, the litigation between Resolute Forest Products and several Greenpeace entities has come to a close, marked by a joint statement agreed by the parties. While these particular cases have ended, the underlying issues that sparked them remain urgent: the future of the Boreal Forest, the rights of Indigenous Peoples, and the responsibility of corporations that profit from forest destruction.

Around the world, people have shown that when they speak up, companies can be pushed to change how they source and use forest products. Public pressure has helped drive major brands like Kimberly-Clark, Procter & Gamble, Hewlett-Packard, and 3M to adopt policies that raise the bar for their suppliers, including companies like Resolute. These policies matter: they send a strong signal that forest destruction is bad for business and that suppliers must improve their practices if they want to keep major customers.

But not all companies are listening.

Rite Aid, a major customer of Resolute, continues to ignore the links between the paper products it sells and the destruction of forests, despite outreach urging it to act. As a significant buyer, Rite Aid has real power to push its suppliers toward better practices—or to walk away from those that refuse to change. Instead, it has so far chosen not to implement a meaningful paper policy that would help protect forests and respect Indigenous rights.

That needs to change, and public pressure can help make it happen.

Rite Aid should be hearing from everyone who cares about forests, climate, and human rights. People can send clear, public messages through social media calling on the company to adopt a strong paper policy and to stop supporting suppliers that destroy critical forest ecosystems.

This is especially urgent in the Boreal Forest, where Resolute’s logging operations continue to have serious impacts. The Boreal is a globally significant forest that plays a vital role in absorbing carbon, supporting biodiversity, and overlapping with the traditional territories of many Indigenous Peoples. Logging by Resolute has been linked to the destruction of critical caribou habitat and operations carried out without the consent of affected Indigenous communities. At the same time, a separate lawsuit by Resolute against Greenpeace Canada is still ongoing, underscoring that the conflict over forest protection and corporate accountability is far from resolved.

The end of some legal battles does not mean the end of the fight for forests. Companies that profit from the Boreal must be held to account, and their customers must no longer look the other way. By speaking up—especially to major buyers like Rite Aid—people can help protect the Boreal Forest, defend Indigenous rights, and push the marketplace toward real, lasting change.
