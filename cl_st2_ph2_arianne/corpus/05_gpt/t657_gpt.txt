Around the world, people are turning to the language of human rights to confront the climate crisis and demand climate justice. They are using courts and human rights bodies to hold governments and corporations accountable for the damage caused by climate change and for their failure to act fast enough.

Climate change is not only an environmental issue. It harms ecosystems, threatens health, and undermines basic rights, including the rights to life, food, and safety. These impacts are not felt equally: those who are already vulnerable and marginalised are often hit first and worst. Communities who contributed least to the crisis are facing rising seas, extreme weather, and collapsing livelihoods, while powerful actors continue polluting.

In response, people are pushing back through climate litigation grounded in human rights. Young people in Colombia have successfully gone to court to defend the Amazon Basin, arguing for their rights and the protection of this vital ecosystem. In the Philippines, an investigation has examined the role of major fossil fuel companies—the “carbon majors”—in contributing to climate change and its human rights impacts. In Switzerland, a group of senior women are pursuing a case against their government, arguing that inadequate action on emissions violates their rights.

These efforts are part of a broader global movement insisting that climate policies must respect, protect, and fulfil human rights. At the UN climate talks at COP 24, human rights experts urged governments to take rights-based climate action, recognising that climate decisions directly affect people’s lives, health, and security.

To support communities who want to use the power of human rights in their own struggles, Greenpeace has developed the People’s Guide. This guide helps people understand how to build climate cases that centre human rights, providing tools for communities to seek justice, demand accountability, and push for stronger climate action that protects both people and the planet.
