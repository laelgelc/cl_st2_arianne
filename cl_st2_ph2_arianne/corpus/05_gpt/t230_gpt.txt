Across Europe, the meat industry is pouring millions into advertising designed to push back against the rise of vegetarian, vegan, and flexitarian eating. A new study from Greenpeace Denmark, “Dissected,” shows how these campaigns are not just about selling products, but about selling powerful stories about who we are and what we value.

Semioticians working on the study examined meat industry campaigns and identified seven recurring myths that shape how meat is marketed. These myths are carefully crafted to tap into people’s emotional needs for belonging, identity, and well-being. They are not neutral messages about food; they are narratives that position meat as central to a good life.

The first myth frames meat as a climate solution. In this story, meat is rebranded as compatible with environmental responsibility, allowing companies to reassure consumers who are increasingly worried about the climate crisis. Instead of questioning high levels of meat consumption, the myth suggests that simply choosing certain meat products is enough to be “climate-friendly.”

The second myth presents meat as inherently healthy. Here, advertising leans on familiar associations between meat, strength, and vitality, implying that a good diet is incomplete without it. This overlooks the growing interest in plant-based eating and reinforces the idea that meat is the default cornerstone of a nutritious meal.

A third myth links meat to masculinity. Campaigns use images and language that equate eating meat with being strong, tough, or “real.” This reinforces gender stereotypes and suggests that cutting back on meat is a threat to male identity, rather than a legitimate and responsible choice.

The fourth myth positions meat as essential for good motherhood. In this narrative, caring parents—especially mothers—are shown serving meat as a way to nurture their children properly. The implication is that choosing less meat, or plant-based alternatives, risks failing to provide what children “need,” placing emotional pressure on parents.

A fifth myth casts meat as patriotic. National symbols, traditions, and cultural pride are woven into advertising to make meat consumption feel like an expression of loyalty to one’s country. Questioning meat-heavy diets is subtly framed as going against national identity or heritage.

The sixth myth presents meat as social. Meat is tied to gatherings, celebrations, and togetherness, from family dinners to barbecues with friends. This reinforces the idea that eating less meat is socially isolating or joyless, rather than a normal part of a changing food culture.

The seventh myth links meat to freedom. Advertisements suggest that choosing meat is an expression of personal liberty and autonomy. Any attempt to reduce meat consumption—whether through policy, public health advice, or social norms—is implied to be an attack on individual freedom.

These myths are not randomly targeted. The study shows that they are aimed at groups that are particularly vulnerable to emotional messaging and social pressure: children, young adults, and parents. Children and young people are still forming their identities and habits, while parents are under constant pressure to “do the right thing” for their families. By appealing to their desires for acceptance, strength, care, belonging, and independence, Big Meat’s campaigns make it harder for people to act on their concerns about health and the climate.

“Dissected” highlights that this is not just a matter of marketing tactics, but a public issue that demands a regulatory response. As awareness grows about the climate and health impacts of high meat consumption, the industry’s advertising strategies risk undermining efforts to shift towards more sustainable and plant-rich diets.

The study calls on public authorities to step in and regulate meat marketing in ways comparable to existing restrictions on tobacco and alcohol. Just as those regulations were introduced to protect public health from powerful industries and manipulative advertising, similar measures are needed now to support planetary health and help people make food choices that align with their values and with the needs of the climate.
