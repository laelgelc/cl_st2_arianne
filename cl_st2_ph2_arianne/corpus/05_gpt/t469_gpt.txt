In the midst of the COVID-19 crisis and the economic shocks it has unleashed, humanity stands at a crossroads. The choices made now about where money flows and whose interests are prioritized will shape our societies and our planet for decades to come. This moment must not be used to prop up the very industries that are destroying our common home. Instead, it is a chance to direct investments toward a just transition that protects both planetary and human health.

The pandemic has exposed how fragile and unequal our systems are. It has also shown how quickly governments can mobilize vast sums of public money in the face of an emergency. That same urgency and scale of response must be applied to the climate and ecological crises. Public funds should not be poured into planet-destroying industries that deepen pollution, accelerate climate breakdown, and sacrifice the health and safety of communities. They should be used to build societies that are more resilient, fair, and in harmony with nature.

This means holding leaders to account for the decisions they make now. Bailouts and recovery packages must not be written as blank cheques for corporations that have long profited from exploitation and environmental destruction. The Shock Doctrine—using crises to push through harmful policies and strip away protections—must be resisted wherever it appears. Workers and communities cannot be treated as expendable, forced to shoulder the costs while powerful interests emerge even stronger.

Instead, this is a time to invest in an open, cooperative, equal and peaceful future. One where economies are reoriented around care, community, and ecological balance, rather than endless extraction and short-term profit. A future in which our relationship with nature is based on respect and interdependence, not domination.

The response to the virus has already revealed powerful currents of cooperation and solidarity. People are organizing to support neighbours, protect the vulnerable, and share resources and knowledge. These are the values and practices that must guide how we rebuild. Protecting people must come before protecting industries. Recovery plans should prioritize those who are most at risk—workers, low-income communities, and those already facing the worst impacts of environmental harm.

Building alliances across movements and borders is essential. Health, climate, labour rights, social justice, and human rights are deeply intertwined. The same systems that sacrifice people to pollution and climate chaos also leave them exposed in a pandemic. By standing together, it is possible to demand that recovery efforts strengthen public health, safeguard the environment, and expand democratic participation, instead of concentrating power and wealth even further.

This moment also calls for new forms of leadership, rooted in compassion and courage. It asks us to learn from the lessons unfolding around us: how quickly behaviour can change when life is at stake, how vital public systems and collective action are, and how deeply we depend on one another and on the natural world. Leadership now means refusing to go back to a “normal” that was already failing so many people and destroying the planet.

On a personal level, navigating these overlapping crises can feel overwhelming. Many are struggling to find balance while caring for loved ones, facing uncertainty, or coping with isolation and fear. Yet even in this difficult time, there are countless acts of bravery and community—health workers risking their lives, neighbours supporting each other, people sharing what they have and standing up for those with less. These moments show what is possible when empathy and solidarity take precedence over greed and indifference.

The path forward is not guaranteed. Powerful interests are already working to use this crisis to entrench their control and keep the world locked into destructive patterns. But another way is within reach. By refusing to bankroll planet-destroying industries, demanding accountability from leaders, and insisting that recovery efforts serve people and the Earth, we can push toward a future that is more just, more caring, and more aligned with the needs of the living world.

The choices made now will echo far beyond the pandemic. Let them be choices that honour our shared vulnerability, our capacity for courage, and our responsibility to each other and to the planet we call home.
