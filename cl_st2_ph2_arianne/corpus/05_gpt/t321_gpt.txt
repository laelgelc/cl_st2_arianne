We spent three days moving between two oceans, yet it felt like stepping into an entirely different world.

Our journey from the Caribbean to the Pacific began with patience. Before we could even enter the Panama Canal, we joined a two-day queue, waiting our turn among ships of every size and purpose. The Canal is one of the busiest shipping routes on Earth, and it shows: tankers, cargo ships, and smaller vessels all lined up, inching forward toward the narrow gateway between seas.

When our time finally came, the crossing itself took around nine hours. The Canal’s six locks slowly lifted and lowered us between sea levels, a monumental piece of engineering that still feels surreal when you’re in the middle of it. We moved through each lock in stages, surrounded by concrete walls and the echoing calls of Canal workers guiding ships through tight spaces.

Because of the pandemic, every interaction with Canal staff required extra care. Distancing, masks, and strict precautions shaped the transit. Even the routine moments—passing a line, receiving instructions—were done with cautious separation. It was a reminder that even out here, between oceans, we are still living in a changed world.

In between maneuvers and safety checks, we used every moment we could to look outward. The Canal is more than a shipping lane; it’s also a corridor of life. Along the banks and in the surrounding waters we spotted cranes and waterfowls, moving through the shallows or perched along the edges. The most startling sight was a crocodile, gliding just beneath the surface near the shore, a reminder that wild nature persists even where industry is most intense.

Our crossing also included half a day of mast maintenance. While some of the crew worked aloft, checking and adjusting equipment, the rest of us watched the Canal slowly slide by. The combination of ship work, careful navigation, and wildlife watching turned those hours into a compressed snapshot of life at sea: practical tasks, constant vigilance, and sudden moments of wonder.

Once we emerged into the Pacific, the character of the voyage changed. The enclosed feeling of the Canal gave way to the open sweep of ocean, and with it came new encounters. Spotted and spinner dolphins appeared, riding the bow and leaping in tight arcs beside the ship. Their presence broke the monotony of long watches and reminded us why we were here.

We saw sea turtles drifting at the surface, lifting their heads briefly before disappearing again. Tuna moved below, their presence betrayed by splashes and the attention of seabirds circling overhead. These sightings were more than just beautiful—they underscored the urgency of protecting these waters from threats like ghost nets and destructive fishing practices that kill marine life indiscriminately.

The Pacific’s richness contrasted with the memories we carried from the Caribbean side of the voyage. There, flying fish had skimmed away from our bow in glittering bursts, vanishing as quickly as they appeared. Seabirds followed us, including pelicans and boobies, each adapted perfectly to life between sky and sea. Their effortless movement over the waves felt like a quiet continuity as we made our way toward the Canal.

The transition from the Caribbean to the Pacific compressed so many elements of ocean life into just a few days: crowded shipping lanes, heavy infrastructure, and delicate ecosystems all existing side by side. From the cranes and waterfowls along the Canal’s edges to the dolphins, turtles, tuna, pelicans, and boobies out in open water, every encounter reinforced the same message: these oceans are alive, and they need protection.

Our voyage through the Panama Canal was more than a passage between two bodies of water. It was a moving reminder of how closely human activity and marine life are intertwined—and how vital it is to defend these waters from the dangers we have created.
