When the heavy rain finally stopped and the river began to recede, the damage at Hangang Park was impossible to ignore. Pathways were broken, trees uprooted, and familiar spaces along the water’s edge were buried under mud and debris. This wasn’t just another rainy season. Korea had just endured the wettest monsoon on record, and the human cost was devastating: 42 people lost their lives, more than 8,000 became victims of the flooding, and landslides and agricultural losses rippled through communities across the country.

Standing in the middle of a place normally filled with cyclists, families, and people enjoying the river, the destruction felt like a warning. The floods weren’t an isolated disaster; they were part of a growing pattern. As the climate crisis accelerates, extreme rainfall, rising sea levels, and more powerful storms are making events like this more frequent and more severe.

Greenpeace analysis shows just how stark the future could be if we do not act. By 2030, an estimated 3.3 million people in Korea could be affected by flooding driven by climate change – a result of sea level rise combined with more frequent and intense storms. The scenes at Hangang Park offer a glimpse of what that future might look like, unless we change course now.

This is why urgent political action is essential. The Korean government must recognize that what we are facing is not a distant threat but a present emergency. Declaring a climate emergency would be a crucial first step, signaling that every part of government must prioritize the crisis and respond at the scale science demands.

Alongside this, Korea needs clear, ambitious targets: halving greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. These goals are not abstract numbers; they are lifelines that can help prevent the kind of suffering already experienced during this record-breaking monsoon season from becoming the new normal.

There are reasons for hope. Around the world, governments and companies are beginning to respond to the climate crisis. Corporate commitments, such as those made by Apple, show that major businesses are starting to take responsibility for their climate impact. On a broader scale, initiatives like the EU Green Deal demonstrate that large economies can begin reshaping their policies and investments toward a greener, more sustainable future.

These actions, while not sufficient on their own, prove that change is possible when there is political will and public pressure. They show that solutions exist and that transformation at scale is achievable.

What happens next in Korea will depend on all of us. The damage at Hangang Park, the lives lost, and the thousands of victims of this year’s monsoon must not be forgotten once the waters fully recede. They should be a catalyst for stronger climate policies, faster emission cuts, and a just transition away from fossil fuels.

Collective action is our greatest source of hope. Governments must act, corporations must follow through on their commitments and go further, and the public must demand that the climate crisis be treated with the urgency it deserves. By raising our voices, supporting strong climate policies, and standing together, we can help ensure that the future is not defined by ever-worsening disasters, but by our shared determination to prevent them.
