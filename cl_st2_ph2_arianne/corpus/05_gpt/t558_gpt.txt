From the icy edges of Antarctica to the hidden depths of the Atlantic, Greenpeace’s Pole to Pole voyage set out to show both the wonders of our oceans and the mounting threats they face. Every mile of the journey underscored the same urgent truth: the world needs a strong UN Global Ocean Treaty to create ocean sanctuaries and give marine life a fighting chance.

The voyage began in the Antarctic, where the impacts of climate change and industrial pressures are already reshaping life at the bottom of the world. Here, researchers documented worrying declines in penguin populations. These declines are closely linked to the scarcity of krill, the tiny crustaceans that form the backbone of the Antarctic food web. As krill numbers drop, penguins and other wildlife lose a critical food source, revealing how fragile and interconnected this ecosystem has become.

Further north, the expedition reached the Amazon Reef, a unique and still little-known ecosystem off the coast of South America. There, the team gathered evidence confirming that the area is a vital breeding ground for whales. This discovery highlighted the Amazon Reef’s importance not just as a biodiversity hotspot, but as a nursery for some of the ocean’s most iconic and vulnerable animals.

In the Sargasso Sea, the crew encountered a different kind of threat. This region, famous for its floating mats of seaweed and rich marine life, is increasingly choked with plastic pollution. Wildlife is becoming trapped in drifting debris, turning what should be a safe haven into a deadly maze of human waste. The images and data gathered there made the scale of plastic pollution painfully clear.

The journey then took the ship to the Lost City hydrothermal vents, a spectacular deep-sea landscape unlike anywhere else on Earth. These vents, teeming with unique life, now face the looming threat of deep-sea mining. The Pole to Pole voyage documented this risk, showing how mining interests are pushing into some of the most remote and least understood parts of the planet, long before their ecological value is fully known.

Throughout the expedition, Greenpeace teams confronted industrial fishing vessels on the high seas, exposing the role of overfishing in degrading marine ecosystems. They carried out research on turtles and sharks, species that are both emblematic and highly vulnerable, to better understand how human activities are affecting them. This scientific work added crucial evidence to the case for large-scale ocean protection.

The voyage’s message was also carried onto screens around the world through the film “Turtle Journey.” This story brought the reality of ocean threats into everyday homes, helping people connect emotionally with what is at stake and why urgent action is needed.

All of these findings and stories fed into a single political demand: a strong, binding UN Global Ocean Treaty capable of creating vast ocean sanctuaries, free from destructive human activity. Yet, as the voyage’s evidence mounted, UN negotiations remained disappointing, failing to deliver the level of protection scientists and communities are calling for.

From penguin colonies in trouble to whales breeding in fragile reefs, from plastic-entangled wildlife to deep-sea vents at risk of mining, the Pole to Pole voyage showed that the ocean is at a crossroads. The threats are global, but so is the opportunity. With a robust UN Global Ocean Treaty, the world can turn these warnings into a turning point for the blue heart of our planet.
