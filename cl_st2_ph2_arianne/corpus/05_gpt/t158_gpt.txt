The aviation industry wants us to believe that we can keep flying more and more without worsening the climate crisis. Slick ads, glossy sustainability reports and soothing promises of “green” flying all tell the same story: don’t worry, technology and clever accounting will fix everything. But behind the PR, aviation’s climate impact keeps growing – and the so‑called solutions being pushed are mostly smoke and mirrors.

A central pillar of this greenwashing is carbon offsetting. Airlines sell the idea that you can neutralise the climate impact of a flight by paying a little extra to “offset” emissions somewhere else. In reality, this does not make the jet fuel burned at 10,000 metres disappear. Offsetting does not effectively reduce emissions from flying; it simply shifts responsibility away from the industry and onto paper promises. It allows airlines to claim progress while their planes continue to pump greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.

Another favourite claim is that sustainable aviation fuels – or SAF – will soon make flying climate‑friendly. But SAF is currently scarce, often unsustainable, and nowhere near the scale needed to decarbonise aviation. Presenting it as a silver bullet ignores the hard limits of feedstocks and land, and distracts from the urgent need to reduce overall flight numbers. Betting on a fuel that barely exists today, and that brings its own environmental problems, is not a credible climate plan.

Alongside offsets and SAF, airlines promote efficiency improvements and “net zero” pathways as proof they are on track. More efficient aircraft and operations can help, but these gains are routinely swallowed up by growth in air traffic. The myth of “net zero” flying – where emissions are supposedly balanced by removals or offsets – creates a dangerous illusion that we can fly as much as we like as long as we tick the right accounting boxes. This delays real action and locks in more expansion of airports and routes.

All the while, the aviation sector enjoys generous public support. Subsidies and tax exemptions keep ticket prices artificially low and encourage more flying. Kerosene, the fossil fuel that powers most planes, is often untaxed, giving aviation an unfair advantage over lower‑carbon alternatives like rail. Public money and favourable tax treatment are effectively propping up one of the most climate‑damaging forms of transport.

If governments are serious about limiting global heating to 1.5°C, aviation cannot be allowed to keep growing unchecked. In Europe, that means flights need to decrease by about 2% every year. This is the opposite of what the industry is planning, but it is what the science demands. Reducing flight numbers is not an optional extra; it is a core part of any credible pathway to stay within 1.5°C.

Shifting course requires clear, concrete measures. Fossil fuel advertising – including the glossy campaigns that sell flying as “eco‑friendly” – must be banned so people are no longer misled about aviation’s true impact. Subsidies that encourage more flights have to end, and kerosene must finally be taxed like the polluting fuel it is. At the same time, governments need to invest in and promote rail as the default option for short‑ and medium‑distance journeys, making it affordable, accessible and attractive.

This is not just about cutting emissions; it is about a just transition for workers and communities. Moving away from a model of ever‑expanding air travel towards cleaner transport options can create new, more sustainable jobs and fairer mobility systems. But that will only happen if we stop believing in greenwashed fantasies of guilt‑free flying and start confronting the reality: to protect a stable climate, we have to fly less, support real alternatives, and hold the aviation industry to account for its role in the climate crisis.
