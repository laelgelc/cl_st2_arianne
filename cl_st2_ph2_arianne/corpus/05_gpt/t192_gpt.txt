Nuclear power is often marketed as a quick, safe, and efficient fix for the climate crisis, but the reality is very different. While the urgency to cut greenhouse gas emissions is real, relying on nuclear energy slows down the transition we need and diverts public money away from better solutions.

Nuclear electricity is expensive. With costs in the range of $112–$189 per megawatt-hour, it simply cannot compete with increasingly cheaper renewable energy sources. In a world that must cut emissions fast, every dollar counts: investing in high-cost nuclear projects means fewer resources for technologies that can deliver more clean energy, sooner, for less.

Time is another critical factor. New nuclear plants take an average of 10 years to build. That is far too slow when emissions must fall sharply in this decade. Long construction times lock in delays, while climate impacts worsen and cheaper, faster alternatives are ready to be deployed now. The promise that nuclear power can rapidly decarbonize energy systems does not match the realities of planning, permitting, financing, and building these reactors.

Nuclear plants are also vulnerable to the very climate impacts they are supposed to help address. Heatwaves and water stress can limit or shut down operations, as reactors often depend on large volumes of water for cooling. As temperatures rise and water availability becomes less predictable, this vulnerability undermines nuclear’s reliability just when stable, resilient power systems are most needed.

Despite being branded as “low-carbon,” nuclear energy is not free from significant CO2 emissions. Large amounts of greenhouse gases are released during the construction of plants and the processing of uranium fuel. When these lifecycle emissions are considered, nuclear’s climate benefits are less impressive than its promoters claim, especially compared to renewables that avoid these carbon-intensive stages.

Radioactive waste remains an unresolved problem. Nuclear power produces waste that stays dangerous for extremely long periods, and there is still no widely implemented, long-term solution for managing it safely. This leaves future generations with a toxic legacy while current projects move forward without a clear, sustainable plan for the waste they create.

Taxpayers are also left to shoulder the financial burden. Nuclear projects routinely depend on public subsidies and guarantees, shifting billions in costs and risks from private companies to the public. Instead of supporting distributed, rapidly scalable renewable energy and efficiency measures, public funds are tied up in large, complex nuclear schemes that overrun budgets and schedules.

Security risks add another layer of concern. Nuclear facilities can become targets in cases of terrorism, natural disasters, or war. The situation in Ukraine has shown how dangerous it can be when nuclear plants are caught in conflict zones, raising the possibility of severe radiological consequences that extend far beyond national borders.

New nuclear technologies are often presented as game-changers, but they are not delivering on their promises. Designs like EPR reactors and fusion projects are delayed and over budget, consuming vast resources while failing to provide the timely, affordable climate solutions they were supposed to offer. Betting on these unproven or underperforming technologies postpones the real work of transforming energy systems.

In contrast, renewable energy offers a faster, cheaper, and more scalable path to cutting emissions. Wind, solar, and other renewables can be deployed quickly, at falling costs, and without the long-term radioactive waste, security risks, and high financial burdens associated with nuclear power. In the race to stabilize the climate, choosing renewables over nuclear is not just a matter of preference—it is a matter of speed, cost, and safety in a rapidly closing window of opportunity.
