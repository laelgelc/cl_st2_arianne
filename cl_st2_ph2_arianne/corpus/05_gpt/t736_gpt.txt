Across Europe, cities are rethinking how people move in order to tackle air pollution and cut emissions. The focus is shifting away from private cars and toward public transport, cycling, and walking, with some cities already reshaping streets and public spaces to make cleaner travel the easiest choice.

Oslo is one of the clearest examples of this shift. The city is actively enhancing its cycling infrastructure, introducing car-free zones and transforming car parks into bike lanes. These changes free up space for people rather than vehicles and make cycling a more practical, safer option for daily trips.

Amsterdam is often seen as the global symbol of cycling, with more bikes than people. Its streets were redesigned following protests in the 1970s against traffic fatalities, which pushed the city to prioritise cyclists and pedestrians over cars. Yet despite its cycling culture, Amsterdam still exceeds EU air pollution limits. This shows that even cities with extensive bike use must continue to reduce emissions and traffic-related pollution.

Copenhagen is another leading city for active mobility. Its bike lanes are widely used and highly popular, and the city strongly encourages walking as part of everyday life. However, while its cycling and walking environment is strong, Copenhagen’s public transport only ranks in the mid-range, indicating room for improvement in offering a fully integrated, low-emission transport system.

Vienna has taken a different but complementary approach by making public transport affordable. Lower costs help shift people away from car use and support more equitable access to clean mobility options. Zurich, meanwhile, boasts high public transport usage, showing that many residents already rely on buses, trams, and trains. At the same time, the city needs to improve safety for cyclists and pedestrians to ensure that all sustainable modes are protected and encouraged.

A Greenpeace report compares 13 European cities, identifying both leaders and laggards in the transition away from car dependence. The ranking underscores that some cities are moving quickly to clean up their transport systems, while others are still falling behind. Those poorer-performing cities are now facing legal action from the EU for failing to meet air quality standards, underlining that inaction on pollution has real consequences.

Together, these examples show that transforming urban transport is possible—and already happening—but also that progress is uneven. Expanding safe cycling and walking infrastructure, improving and making public transport affordable, and reducing car dominance are all essential steps for cleaner air and lower emissions in European cities.
