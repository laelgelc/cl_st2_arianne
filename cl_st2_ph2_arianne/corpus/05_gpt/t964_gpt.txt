Reindeer, also known as caribou (Rangifer tarandus), are full of remarkable adaptations that help them thrive in some of the harshest environments on Earth. From the tips of their antlers to the pads of their hooves, almost every part of their bodies tells a story about life in the Arctic.

One of the most striking features of reindeer is their antlers. They grow a new set every year, and each animal’s antlers are unique, like fingerprints. While they are growing, the antlers are covered in a soft, warm layer known as velvet, which helps supply them with blood and nutrients. In winter, males shed their antlers around December, while females keep theirs for longer. The antlers that fall to the ground don’t go to waste; they become a valuable source of minerals for other animals that gnaw on them.

Reindeer are also unusual among mammals for the richness of their milk. Reindeer milk contains about 22% butterfat and 10% protein, making it exceptionally dense and nourishing. This concentrated nutrition is vital for calves growing up in cold, demanding Arctic conditions, where every calorie counts.

Their eyes hold another surprise. Reindeer eyes actually change color with the seasons, shifting from a golden hue in the brighter months to blue in the darker season. This change is linked to the extreme variations in light that define Arctic life, and it is one of the many ways reindeer are tuned to their environment.

Built for movement across vast distances, reindeer are speedy runners and highly energy-efficient. They can cover long stretches of tundra and snow while using relatively little energy, an essential skill for migrating, finding food, and avoiding predators. Their bodies are superbly adapted to conserve warmth. They have hollow hair that traps insulating air, helping them stay warm in freezing temperatures. Their noses warm the cold air they breathe in, protecting their lungs and helping maintain body temperature. Even their feet change with the seasons: the pads on their hooves adapt as conditions shift, helping them move across ice, snow, and bare ground.

Reindeer are not just visually distinctive; they also have a characteristic soundscape. Their knees make an audible clicking noise when they walk, a sound often associated with reindeer herds on the move. Inside their throats, air sacs help them produce unique vocalizations, adding another layer to the way they communicate with one another.

All of these details reveal reindeer as finely tuned Arctic specialists, shaped by the cold, the dark, the light, and the long distances they must travel.
