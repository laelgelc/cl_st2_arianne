The choices governments and societies make during the COVID-19 crisis will echo far beyond this moment. In their letter, Greenpeace leaders Jennifer Morgan and Anabella Rosemberg stress that the way we respond now will profoundly shape the climate emergency and the kind of future we build.

They argue that recovery efforts must invest in public health and planetary health together, rather than pouring resources into planet‑wrecking industries that deepen inequality and environmental destruction. For them, a just transition means directing support toward systems that protect people and nature, not those that fuel the next crisis.

They also warn that moments of shock and confusion can be exploited. Invoking the idea of the “shock doctrine,” they call for vigilance against those who would use this crisis to roll back protections or entrench harmful economic models. Instead, they urge a path based on cooperation, equality, and living in harmony with nature.

At the heart of their message is a call for community and compassion. The virus, they write, does not demand blame or division; it demands that we protect the most vulnerable and learn the deep lessons this crisis offers. That includes recognizing how interconnected we are and how much we depend on systems of care.

They share personal reflections on the strain their own families are facing—juggling responsibilities, coping with uncertainty, and worrying about loved ones. Within these challenges, they see countless acts of courage and solidarity. For them, these everyday examples of care are not a distraction from the political and environmental struggle; they are central to it.

Their letter closes on the need to keep care at the center of our priorities while remaining vigilant. As the world navigates COVID-19 and the climate emergency, they insist that we have a choice: either return to a harmful “normal” or seize this moment to build a fairer, more compassionate world in balance with the planet.
