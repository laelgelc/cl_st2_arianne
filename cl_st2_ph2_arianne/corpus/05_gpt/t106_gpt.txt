In the coastal town of Cayar, Senegal, a community-led struggle is unfolding against industrial pollution and its impacts on people’s lives, health, and food security. At the centre of this fight is the Taxawu Cayar Collective, a local group that has taken the TPM fishmeal factory to court for discharging toxic waste into the surrounding waters.

Community members, fishers, and local leaders say the factory’s operations are threatening jobs, access to food, and public health. On 6 October 2022, these concerns were brought formally before a court, where the Taxawu Cayar Collective presented evidence that included laboratory results showing the presence of toxic metals in the water, as well as video footage documenting illegal dumping by the factory.

Despite the gravity of the evidence, a ruling in November 2022 dismissed a request for the temporary shutdown of the factory. This decision did not end the community’s efforts. Instead, it marked a new phase in their struggle, as they continued to organise and seek legal avenues to protect their environment and livelihoods.

By January 2023, the pressure exerted by the community and its allies contributed to a significant local decision: the municipality of Cayar banned the discharge of wastewater into the environment. This municipal measure has, in turn, prompted further litigation, as the conflict between community rights and industrial activity moves into a new legal and political chapter.

The stakes in Cayar are high. The fishmeal industry in the region processes more than 500,000 tonnes of fish every year. This massive extraction of a key food resource has deep consequences for coastal communities who depend on fish for both income and nutrition. Local leaders, together with Greenpeace Africa, have highlighted how this scale of industrial fishing and processing is worsening food insecurity, especially for people who have traditionally relied on small-scale fisheries.

In Cayar, the fight against toxic pollution is inseparable from the fight to defend the right to food, decent work, and a healthy environment. The Taxawu Cayar Collective’s case against the TPM factory stands as a clear example of how communities are organising to confront environmentally destructive practices and to demand that public authorities and industries put people and the planet before profit.
