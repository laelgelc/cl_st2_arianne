During Women’s Month, Luchelle Feukeng dreams of a green Africa where climate action and women’s empowerment go hand in hand. In her vision, the continent is transformed by decisions that protect people and the planet, and women are at the centre of this change.

She imagines a South Africa where renewable energy has finally brought an end to load shedding. Without daily power cuts, female students can study at night without fear, in well-lit, safe environments. Electricity is no longer a privilege but a right that supports girls’ education and women’s independence.

In Cameroon, she sees women moving freely through clean forests and along unpolluted rivers. The city of Yaoundé is no longer choked by plastic bottles. Streets, streams, and markets are free of plastic waste, and the air and water are healthier. Women, who often carry the burden of caring for families, no longer have to worry about the health impacts of plastic pollution on their children and communities.

In the Democratic Republic of Congo, Luchelle’s vision includes a historic decision: the cancellation of oil block sales that threaten forests. Vast forest landscapes are kept intact, and Indigenous People celebrate the protection of their ancestral lands. Their knowledge, culture, and stewardship of the forest are recognised and respected, and the forest continues to sustain life and regulate the climate.

Along the Senegalese coast, she imagines women returning to the oceans and finding fish in abundance again. The waters are no longer depleted, and women fish processors and traders can once more secure food for their families and communities. Children eat nutritious meals, and livelihoods tied to the sea are restored.

In Kenya, a single change in law reshapes rural life. By amending a seed law, farmers are again allowed to share uncertified seeds. This simple act of exchanging seeds between neighbours and communities sparks celebrations across the country. Women farmers, in particular, gain more control over what they plant and how they feed their families, safeguarding local biodiversity and resilience.

These are not just scattered images for Luchelle Feukeng; they form a connected, hopeful picture of a green Africa. She dreams of using her voice and energy to advocate for this reality, where climate action protects forests and oceans, cleans cities, and strengthens the rights and opportunities of women and Indigenous communities across the continent.
