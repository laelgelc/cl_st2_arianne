Indonesia is home to some of the world’s most biodiverse and ecologically important forests. These landscapes support an incredible range of species and play a crucial role in storing carbon, regulating the climate, and sustaining local communities. Yet, like the Amazon and other forests across the globe, Indonesia’s forests are under severe threat from deforestation and fires, driving some of the highest carbon emissions in the world from land-use change.

The destruction is closely tied to the expansion of commodities such as palm oil, soya, and meat. These supply chains are often linked to forest clearance and burning, even when products are marketed globally as “sustainable.” Annisa Rahmawati, a forests campaigner with Greenpeace Indonesia, stresses that this is not just a local issue; it is part of a global crisis of forest destruction and climate breakdown.

She calls on companies to urgently cut ties with any suppliers that are linked to deforestation and to ensure that their entire supply chains are genuinely deforestation-free. This means going beyond paper policies and taking real responsibility for how raw materials are produced. Consumers, too, have a critical role: by demanding deforestation-free products and holding brands to account, they can push the market away from forest destruction and toward protection and restoration.

Annisa also points to the role of governments, criticizing those that enable or turn a blind eye to deforestation instead of enforcing strong protections. Weak regulations, poor enforcement, and political support for destructive industries all contribute to the ongoing loss of forests and the emissions that drive the climate crisis.

In 2018, Greenpeace launched a major campaign targeting Wilmar, the world’s largest palm oil trader, and Mondelez, one of the biggest global buyers of palm oil. The campaign mobilized 1.5 million people, sending a clear signal that the public would not tolerate palm oil linked to forest destruction. Under this pressure, Wilmar adopted No Deforestation, No Peat, No Exploitation (NDPE) commitments and, together with other stakeholders, issued a joint statement to develop systems for monitoring its supply chain.

However, efforts in 2019 to turn these commitments into a credible, functioning monitoring platform fell short. Despite collaboration, the process did not produce the robust, transparent system needed to truly track and eliminate deforestation from Wilmar’s supply chain. Faced with this failure to establish a credible platform, Greenpeace decided to withdraw from the collaboration.

Annisa’s message is clear: forests as rich and vital as Indonesia’s cannot be protected by weak promises or half-measures. Companies must act decisively to remove deforestation from their supply chains, governments must stop enabling destruction, and consumers must continue to demand products that do not cost the world its forests.
