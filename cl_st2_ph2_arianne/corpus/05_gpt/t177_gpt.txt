Biodiversity is the web of life that sustains us: from the forests that regulate our climate and water cycles, to the oceans that produce much of the oxygen we breathe, to the countless species that underpin our food systems and health. This diversity of life is not a luxury; it is the foundation of our survival and well‑being, playing a crucial role in food security, human health, and our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing climate.

Yet this foundation is under severe threat. Human activity is driving a biodiversity crisis so profound that one million species are now at risk of extinction. Vast ecosystems that once thrived are being degraded or destroyed. Only about 15% of the world’s forests remain intact, and a mere 3% of the oceans can still be considered pristine. As habitats are fragmented and species are pushed to the brink, we are not only losing irreplaceable life forms, but also the vital services they provide.

The consequences of this crisis ripple through every aspect of our lives. The loss of biodiversity worsens climate change by weakening nature’s ability to absorb and store carbon, and by destabilizing ecosystems that help buffer us from extreme weather. It also fuels the rise of zoonotic diseases—those that jump from animals to humans—by increasing risky contact between people and wildlife. COVID‑19 is a stark reminder of how deeply human health is tied to the health of natural systems.

In this context, the UN Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) COP15 meeting in Kunming, China, in the fall of 2022 is a pivotal moment. Governments have the chance to agree a new global framework to halt biodiversity loss and mass extinction. The decisions taken there will shape how the world responds to this emergency over the coming decade.

Central to the discussions is a proposal to protect at least 30% of the world’s lands and oceans by 2030. Safeguarding these areas is critical to give ecosystems room to recover, species space to survive, and nature the chance to continue supporting human societies. But protection on paper is not enough. It must be implemented in ways that respect and uphold the rights of Indigenous Peoples, whose territories often overlap with some of the most biodiverse regions on Earth and whose stewardship has long been essential to conserving them.

Finance and concrete implementation plans are equally crucial. Ambitious targets will remain empty promises without the resources and clear roadmaps needed to put them into practice. That means securing funding and mechanisms that can drive real change on the ground, from restoring damaged habitats to preventing further destruction.

Greenpeace is calling for COP15 to deliver ambitious outcomes that match the scale and urgency of the biodiversity crisis. This means strong, enforceable commitments to protect nature, robust recognition of Indigenous rights, and the financial and practical tools required to turn words into action. The future of countless species—and our own—depends on the choices governments make now.
