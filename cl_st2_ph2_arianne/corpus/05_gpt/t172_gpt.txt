Fossil fuel companies have spent decades polishing their image through advertising and sponsorships while continuing to drive the climate crisis. Their tactics closely mirror those once used by the tobacco industry: fund friendly research, sponsor beloved cultural moments, and flood the public sphere with reassuring messages that distract from the harm their core business causes.

Scientists and academics are increasingly calling this out. A group of 450 scientists has urged advertising and PR agencies to stop working with fossil fuel companies altogether. Their concern is straightforward: as long as major polluters can buy influence and public trust through clever campaigns, it becomes harder to build the political will needed for meaningful climate action.

The latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) adds weight to these concerns. It highlights the role of corporate lobbying and advertising in delaying and weakening climate policies, and it recommends regulation of these practices. The report makes clear that tackling the climate crisis is not only a matter of technology and economics, but also of confronting the ways powerful interests shape public debate and political choices.

Universities are another crucial battleground. More than 500 academics have called on universities to reject research funding from fossil fuel companies. Their goal is to prevent greenwashing – the use of academic partnerships to create a misleading impression of climate responsibility. When research agendas and public messaging are influenced by fossil funding, it becomes harder for universities to be independent voices for science and the public interest.

Meanwhile, fossil fuel sponsorships continue to reach deep into culture and sport. One prominent example is Gazprom’s sponsorship in European football, which remained visible even as Russia invaded Ukraine. This kind of branding helps fossil fuel companies associate themselves with unity, excitement, and positive values, even when their activities are linked to conflict, instability, and a worsening climate emergency.

In response, Greenpeace and 36 other organizations have launched a European Citizens’ Initiative calling for a ban on fossil fuel advertising and sponsorships, modeled on the restrictions placed on tobacco. The aim is to stop fossil fuel companies from using marketing to delay climate action and to reduce their ability to buy social and political influence.

The initiative needs 1 million signatures from EU citizens by October 2022. Reaching this threshold would oblige EU institutions to consider measures to curb fossil fuel advertising and sponsorships. The goal is to help dismantle the fossil fuel industry’s power over public debate and policymaking, opening space for faster, fairer climate action and contributing to both peace and climate protection.
