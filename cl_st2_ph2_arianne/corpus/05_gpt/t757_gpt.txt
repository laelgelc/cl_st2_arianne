Essity’s annual shareholder meeting in Stockholm was the scene of an uncomfortable spotlight on the company’s forest footprint, as Greenpeace presented CEO Magnus Groth with the “Golden Chainsaw Award” for failing to protect old-growth forests.

Essity is Europe’s largest tissue producer, behind everyday brands like Tempo and Velvet. But behind these familiar products lies a supply chain that is driving the destruction of forests that are vital to Sámi reindeer herders.

The problem centres on Essity’s pulp supplier, SCA. Instead of safeguarding old-growth forests, SCA is destroying them and replacing them with plantations of lodgepole pine – an invasive tree species in Sweden. These forests are not just trees on a map; they are critical grazing areas and cultural landscapes for the Sámi people, whose traditional reindeer herding depends on intact, biodiverse forest ecosystems.

This is not a new concern for Essity. In 2017, nearly 250,000 people signed a petition calling on the company to stop sourcing from destructive logging in these areas. Essity also promotes itself with strong sustainability claims. Yet, despite the public pressure and its own rhetoric, the company’s actions have fallen far short of what is needed.

Instead of committing to halt the destruction of old-growth forests, Essity has delayed and deflected. The company has held meetings, asked for more time, and postponed concrete decisions, while logging continues in forests that Sámi communities rely on. Both the Swedish Sámi association (SSR) and Greenpeace have repeatedly demanded that Essity stop sourcing from operations that damage these critical forest landscapes.

By granting Magnus Groth the Golden Chainsaw Award, Greenpeace highlighted this ongoing failure: the gap between Essity’s sustainability image and the reality of its pulp sourcing, and the company’s refusal so far to heed the clear demands of Sámi representatives and hundreds of thousands of concerned people to protect old-growth forests from destruction.
