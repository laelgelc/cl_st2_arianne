Two-thirds of our planet’s oceans lie beyond national borders, in international waters that currently lack strong, binding protection. In these vast areas, exploitation is too often prioritised over conservation, leaving marine life exposed to overfishing, pollution, and the looming threat of new industrial activities.

Nowhere is this more urgent than in the Central Arctic Ocean. This region is warming at roughly twice the global average. Sea ice is melting at an alarming rate, and scientists warn that the Arctic could see ice-free summers as early as 2030. As the ice retreats, it is revealing a “new” ocean – one that has been shielded by ice for millennia and is home to a wealth of vulnerable and little-understood marine life.

Instead of treating this newly accessible region as the next frontier for industrial exploitation, Greenpeace is calling for it to be protected as a sanctuary. In such a sanctuary, extractive activities like industrial fishing, deep sea mining, and oil drilling would be banned. This is not about closing off the Arctic from the world, but about ensuring that the life it supports is not sacrificed for short-term gain.

A strong United Nations treaty for the high seas could make this possible. Right now, governments are negotiating a new global agreement that could finally bring real protection to international waters, including the Central Arctic Ocean. Greenpeace has been closely monitoring recent UN discussions to ensure that this treaty delivers robust safeguards, rather than weak compromises that leave the door open to business as usual.

There is a window of opportunity to secure a lasting legacy for the Arctic and the wider high seas. The chair of the UN negotiations has set an ambitious goal of reaching agreement by 2019. That timeline underlines how little time there is to act, but also how close the world could be to a historic step forward for ocean protection.

By pushing for a strong, enforceable treaty and a sanctuary in the Central Arctic Ocean, Greenpeace is working to ensure that this rapidly changing region is not handed over to extractive industries, but instead safeguarded for the marine life that depends on it – and for future generations.
