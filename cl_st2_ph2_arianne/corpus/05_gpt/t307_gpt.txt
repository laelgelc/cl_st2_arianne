Illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing is often talked about in terms of lost catches and economic damage. But behind the numbers lies a brutal reality of violence, exploitation, and corruption that thrives far from public view.

One stark illustration of how brazen this criminal industry can be is Sea Shepherd’s 110-day chase of a notorious poaching vessel. For more than three months, activists pursued a ship that had built its business on stealing from the ocean, underscoring how determined and well-resourced these operators are—and how difficult they are to stop once they slip into the vastness of the high seas.

The scale of IUU fishing is staggering. An estimated 8–14 million metric tons of illegal fish are taken from the ocean every year, with a black-market value of roughly $9–17 billion. In 2019 alone, about $2.4 billion worth of illegally caught fish is estimated to have entered the United States as imports. These figures represent not just environmental theft, but the erosion of legitimate livelihoods and the fueling of a global criminal economy.

The costs are not only financial or ecological; they are deeply human. Fishery observers—those tasked with monitoring fishing activities and ensuring compliance—often work in some of the most hostile and isolated conditions on Earth. The documentary “Murder at Sea” shines a light on their perilous role, revealing how simply doing their job can put them in mortal danger. On vessels where illegal practices are routine, an observer with a clipboard and a conscience can become a target.

IUU fishing is frequently intertwined with severe human rights abuses. Films like “Buoyancy” and “Ghost Fleet” expose the modern slavery that underpins parts of the fishing industry, particularly in remote waters where oversight is weak or nonexistent. “Ghost Fleet” follows the work of activist Patima Tungpuchayakula, who has dedicated herself to rescuing enslaved fishers trapped on distant vessels and islands. Her efforts reveal a system built on deception and coercion, where people are treated as disposable tools in the pursuit of profit.

Taken together, these stories show that IUU fishing is far more than a matter of illegal nets and forged paperwork. It is a billion-dollar criminal enterprise bound up with murder, slavery, corruption, and lies—one that must be confronted not only as an environmental crime, but as a profound violation of human rights and human dignity.
