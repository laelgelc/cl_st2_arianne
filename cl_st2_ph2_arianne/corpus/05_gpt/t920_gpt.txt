Delegates from 15 European countries are meeting in Gothenburg under the OSPAR Convention to discuss the creation of a new Arctic Marine Protected Area in international waters north of Greenland. The proposed area, shaped like a pie slice and comparable in size to the United Kingdom, would be the first marine protected area in Arctic international waters.

This region is especially important for ice-dependent species such as polar bears, walruses, and harp seals. The Arctic is warming rapidly, and sea ice is melting so quickly that scientists warn the region could face ice-free summers as early as 2030. Despite the urgency, less than 1.5% of the Arctic Ocean is currently protected, and none of that protection lies in international waters.

Previous attempts to secure this protection have met resistance from Norway, Iceland, and Denmark, which have raised technical concerns. However, the proposal now on the table has been strengthened and improved compared with earlier versions, bringing the prospect of meaningful Arctic protection closer than ever.

To coincide with the Gothenburg meeting, Greenpeace is hosting an exhibition aimed at encouraging delegates to seize this moment and agree on protection for this crucial Arctic area. This effort is backed by more than seven million supporters worldwide who are calling for action to safeguard the Arctic for future generations.

Greenpeace is inviting people everywhere to add their voices by signing a declaration in support of the proposed Arctic Marine Protected Area, urging governments to finalize this protection and help secure a safer future for the ice-dependent life at the top of our planet.
