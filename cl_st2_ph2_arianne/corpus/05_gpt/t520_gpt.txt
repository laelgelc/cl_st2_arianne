From the deck of the Greenpeace ship Esperanza, the Sargasso Sea can look almost empty. Katie Camosy, Senior Video Producer at Greenpeace USA, joined the ship’s Pole to Pole expedition to this vast patch of the North Atlantic to help show why that first impression is misleading—and why this unique place needs protection under the Global Oceans Treaty.

As Visuals Lead on board, Katie knew that revealing the Sargasso Sea’s true character meant going far beyond what the human eye can see from the surface. Up top, the scene is deceptively quiet: long stretches of open water, only occasionally broken by a passing seabird or a burst of motion from a flying fish. To most people, it might seem like there’s not much there at all.

To confront that illusion, Katie brought in two underwater photographers, Tavish Campbell and Shane Gross, whose job was to show the living world hidden beneath the waves. Their mission: capture the Sargasso Sea’s biodiversity in a way that could speak loudly enough to reach people far from the ocean.

That meant turning to a specialized technique known as blackwater photography. Instead of diving along a reef or down a sunlit wall, Tavish and Shane entered the water at night, over depths of around 4,000 meters, and descended about 30 meters into the dark. Out there, suspended in the open ocean with no seafloor in sight, they waited for the night shift of the sea to arrive.

Each night, larval and adult creatures migrate upward from the mesopelagic zone, the “twilight” layer of the ocean where very little light penetrates. In this vertical migration, animals rise toward the surface under cover of darkness, and it’s here that the photographers met them—tiny, otherworldly forms drifting past their lights.

By documenting these animals in the water column, rather than in an aquarium or lab, Tavish and Shane helped reveal the Sargasso Sea as it truly is: not an empty blue desert, but a living, dynamic ecosystem that simply doesn’t show itself easily from above. Their images and footage are a crucial part of the Esperanza’s Pole to Pole expedition work, giving people a rare glimpse into life in the open ocean and supporting the effort to secure strong protection for the Sargasso Sea under the Global Oceans Treaty.
