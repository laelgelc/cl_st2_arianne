In 2013, super typhoon Haiyan tore through Tacloban in the Philippines, leaving a trail of devastation that changed countless lives forever. For Joanna Sustento, the storm was not just another disaster on the news—it was the day she lost most of her family.

Haiyan, made more destructive by climate change, did not only wash away homes and livelihoods; it tore families apart and shattered communities. Joanna carries the memory of that day with her, and with it, a determination not to stay silent while lives and livelihoods continue to be sacrificed for corporate profit.

Her grief has become a driving force in her climate activism. Rather than turning inward, Joanna has found personal strength and support by speaking out and standing alongside others who have suffered from climate impacts. She refuses to accept a world where the people least responsible for the climate crisis pay the highest price.

In a powerful letter to Shell and the wider oil industry, Joanna demands justice for her young nephew Tarin, one of the many lives lost to Haiyan, and for the thousands of people killed in the affected communities. She calls on these companies to confront the role they have played in worsening the climate crisis and to take responsibility for mitigating its impacts—before it is too late.

Her message is clear: the consequences of inaction will not spare anyone. Even the families of those working within the fossil fuel industry face the same climate risks. Joanna’s words are both a plea and a warning—an insistence that the industry must change course, not only for the sake of communities like Tacloban, but for their own children and future generations as well.
