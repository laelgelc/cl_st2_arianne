As the first round of UN negotiations for a Global Plastics Treaty wrapped up in Uruguay on December 2, 2022, governments left with more questions than answers—but also with a clearer sense of what is at stake. The meeting, known as INC-1, was largely consumed by procedural debates: how the talks would be structured, what rules would guide decision-making, and how future sessions would be organized. While these questions are important, they also meant that many of the most urgent issues—like how to actually cut plastic production—were pushed to the sidelines.

Throughout the session, communities, experts, and campaigners repeatedly highlighted how plastic pollution is not just an environmental issue, but a crisis for human rights, biodiversity, and the climate. From extraction to disposal, plastics harm frontline communities, contaminate ecosystems, and fuel the climate emergency. This is why Greenpeace and many allied groups went to Uruguay: to push for a strong, legally binding treaty that tackles plastic across its entire lifecycle, from production all the way to disposal.

A central demand was clear global rules to reduce plastic production itself, not just to manage waste once it already exists. Without production cuts, countries will be trapped trying to clean up an ever-growing flood of plastic. Greenpeace also urged negotiators to reject so-called “solutions” that simply shift the problem around, such as chemical recycling. These approaches risk prolonging dependence on plastics and fossil fuels instead of phasing them down.

Despite the slow pace and procedural focus, there were some encouraging signs. Many regional groups of countries expressed a sense of urgency and called for ambitious action. New and strengthened coalitions emerged around just transitions, emphasizing that the shift away from plastics must protect workers and communities, especially those who have been most affected by pollution. Human rights also gained visibility as an objective of the future treaty, helping to anchor the talks in the lived realities of people on the frontlines.

At the same time, powerful obstacles were on full display. Industry lobbying was active throughout the negotiations, pushing to weaken ambition and delay concrete decisions. Procedural wrangling consumed valuable time, slowing progress on the substantive measures needed to protect people and the planet from plastic pollution.

INC-1 closed without the kind of firm commitments needed to match the scale of the crisis, but it did set the stage for what comes next. The next negotiating session is expected to take place in Paris in May 2023. There, governments will have another chance to move beyond process and begin shaping a treaty that can truly confront plastic pollution—from production to disposal, and across its devastating impacts on human rights, biodiversity, and the climate.
