The Covid-19 pandemic made one thing unmistakably clear: access to green and public spaces in cities is not a luxury, but a basic necessity for health and well-being. As lockdowns confined people to their homes and restricted movement, parks, tree-lined streets, and small pockets of urban nature became crucial places of relief—spaces to breathe, move, and reconnect with the living world.

These green spaces do far more than offer a pleasant view. For children, regular contact with nature is linked to better brain development and improved cognitive function. Growing up with trees, parks, and natural play areas nearby can support learning, attention, and emotional regulation, laying foundations that last well beyond childhood.

For adults and older people, urban greenery is closely tied to a lower risk of non-communicable diseases. Living near green spaces and being able to use them is associated with reduced rates of cardiovascular conditions and diabetes, and with lower mortality related to air pollution and physical inactivity. Simply having safe, accessible places to walk, cycle, or sit outdoors can make a measurable difference in how long and how well people live.

Green environments also play a role in pregnancy outcomes. Access to nature has been linked with healthier pregnancies, and people who can spend time in green areas often report better perceived general health. In hospitals, views of nature and nearby green spaces are associated with shorter hospitalization times, showing that greenery supports recovery as well as prevention.

Mental health benefits are equally significant. Urban green spaces help reduce stress, depression, and anxiety, offering a sense of calm and refuge in dense, noisy cities. During the pandemic, many people turned to local parks and natural areas as a way to cope with uncertainty and isolation, underscoring how essential these spaces are for psychological resilience.

Urban civic spaces—such as plazas, squares, and other public gathering areas—can provide related benefits. When these spaces are welcoming, inclusive, and integrated with greenery, they support social connection, physical activity, and mental well-being, helping to build stronger, healthier communities.

One approach that has gained attention is the 3-30-300 Rule, which promotes accessible greenery as a way to confront both climate change and biodiversity loss while improving public health. While details of implementation can vary, the core idea is to set clear, easy-to-understand targets for urban greening so that nature is woven into the places where people actually live and work.

For this to truly work, however, urban greening must be equitable. Authorities are being called upon to ensure that all communities—especially those historically underserved or overexposed to pollution and heat—have fair access to green and public spaces. Making trees, parks, and civic spaces a shared right rather than a privilege is essential to building cities that are healthier, more just, and more resilient in the face of overlapping crises.
