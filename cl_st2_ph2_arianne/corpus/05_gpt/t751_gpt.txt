Oil spills in Russia’s Pechora river region are leaving a trail of poisoned water, dead fish, and damaged lives, especially for Indigenous communities who depend on the land and rivers for their survival. In the villages along the Pechora and its tributaries, people are watching their home change before their eyes as oil leaks into the environment.

Local resident Galina Chuprova describes the oil company Lukoil as if it were an invading enemy, not a neighbor. For her, the company doesn’t just represent pollution; it represents a direct threat to the community’s right to live safely on their own land. She calls on villagers to stand together in defense of their rivers and their future, insisting that unity is the only way to resist the damage being done.

Greenpeace volunteer Julia Lapshina has seen the impacts of oil spills in the region firsthand. She has witnessed toxic slicks and contamination, and she questions how oil producers can continue operating while ignoring basic safety and environmental standards. Her experience raises a stark question: if the companies responsible for extracting oil refuse to prioritize safety, who will protect the people and ecosystems placed in harm’s way?

In response, local activists and environmental defenders are organizing. The Save Pechora Committee, together with Greenpeace, is demanding that oil spills be drastically reduced and that much stricter standards be applied to oil production in the region. For them, it is not enough to clean up after disasters; they want the spills to stop at the source.

To bring people together and raise awareness, they organized a “Skis against oil” race, turning a traditional winter activity into a powerful act of protest. On the snow, villagers and supporters came together to show that the Pechora region is not just a resource to be exploited, but a living home worth defending. The event connected local struggles to the broader Break Free from Fossil Fuels movement, making clear that what happens on the Pechora river is part of a global fight for a safer climate and a just energy transition.

Members of the Save Pechora Committee, including Dmitriy Kanev and Fyodor Terentiev, explain that their motivation comes from a deep commitment to protecting nature and preserving traditional ways of life. For them, defending the river is the same as defending their culture, their food, and their future. They emphasize that no one can win this fight alone: only collective action—villagers, volunteers, and supporters standing side by side—has the power to challenge destructive fossil fuel interests and protect the Pechora for generations to come.
