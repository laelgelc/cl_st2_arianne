In 2008, a series of food safety scandals in China raised urgent questions about what people were really bringing home from the market. Against this backdrop, Greenpeace China launched a campaign focused on pesticides in fresh produce, working to expose risks and push for systemic change in how fruits and vegetables are grown, monitored, and sold.

A key moment in this effort came in 2015, when Greenpeace China supported a lawsuit against the major retailer Lianhua. The case centered on pesticide residues in fresh produce, and it helped drive a major policy response in Shanghai. Following the pressure and public scrutiny generated by the campaign and the lawsuit, Shanghai authorities established a city-wide traceability system for fresh produce. This system made it possible to track where produce was coming from and how it moved through the supply chain. As part of this shift, 50% of fresh produce in Shanghai began to be sourced locally. The city’s new system strengthened food safety oversight and has since been held up as a model at the national level.

The campaign also led directly to changes in corporate practice. Under pressure from Greenpeace China’s work and public concern, Lianhua agreed to drop 46 harmful pesticides from its supply chain. This demonstrated that retailers could take responsibility for reducing hazardous chemicals in the food they sell and that consumer and civil society pressure could drive such commitments.

Despite these advances, recent testing has shown that pesticide contamination remains a serious problem. Greenpeace China carried out tests on produce from six supermarket chains in eight cities. The results showed that 87% of the samples contained pesticide residues above safety limits. Produce that was wrapped in plastic had the highest levels of pesticide residues among the items tested, highlighting how packaging does not necessarily mean safer food and can in fact be associated with higher contamination.

These findings underscore the ongoing gap between policy goals and on-the-ground reality. In 2015, the Chinese government introduced a policy aiming for zero growth in pesticide use by 2020. This target signaled official recognition of the health and environmental risks linked to chemical-intensive agriculture. At the same time, sustainable organic farming has been emerging as an alternative approach, offering a way to reduce reliance on synthetic pesticides while still producing food.

Greenpeace China’s campaign, from its origins in 2008 through the landmark 2015 lawsuit and beyond, shows how public pressure, legal action, and policy advocacy can combine to shift both government systems and corporate behavior. Shanghai’s traceability system and Lianhua’s decision to stop using dozens of harmful pesticides are concrete outcomes. Yet the persistently high levels of pesticide residues found in supermarkets across multiple cities indicate that much more work is needed to align everyday food production and retail practices with the goal of safer, more sustainable agriculture.
