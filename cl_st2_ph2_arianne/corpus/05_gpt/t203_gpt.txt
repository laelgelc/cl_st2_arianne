Greenpeace Argentina, together with allied organizations, filed a class action lawsuit challenging the government’s approval of Equinor’s seismic exploration in the Argentine Sea. The organizations argued that the authorization was unconstitutional and posed serious risks to marine life and coastal communities. This legal action helped catalyze the #Atlanticazo movement, a wave of protests and public mobilizations along the coast and in other parts of the country.

In response, the Federal Court in Mar del Plata issued a precautionary measure that indefinitely suspended the seismic exploration project. The court’s decision underscored the importance of transparency and real citizen participation in environmental decision-making. It also stressed the need to comply with the Escazú Agreement, which guarantees access to information, public participation, and justice in environmental matters.

The ruling required that any environmental impact assessment for the project must properly address cumulative impacts and apply the precautionary principle. It recognized potential dangers such as oil spills and broader harm to marine ecosystems, and treated these risks as central to evaluating the project’s legality and legitimacy.  

This court decision represents a significant victory for public action and collective organizing in defense of the ocean and coastal territories, in a context marked by escalating climate and ecological crises.
