HD Hyundai Construction Equipment has announced a significant step to curb the use of its machinery in illegal gold mining across key Indigenous territories in the Brazilian Amazon. The company has committed to halt sales of heavy machinery in the states of Amazonas, Roraima, and Pará, stop providing maintenance services and spare parts, and terminate a dealership contract in the region. The decision aims to prevent its excavators from being used in illegal operations within the territories of the Kayapó, Munduruku, and Yanomami peoples.

This move comes in direct response to evidence revealed by Greenpeace. Between 2021 and 2023, Greenpeace documented 176 excavators operating in these Indigenous territories. Of these, 43% were manufactured by HD Hyundai Construction Equipment, making it the most commonly used brand among miners in these illegal activities.

Greenpeace’s findings were accompanied by a series of campaigns designed to push the company to act. These included press conferences and public demonstrations that highlighted the link between industrial machinery and the destruction caused by illegal mining in protected areas. The pressure helped bring about HD Hyundai Construction Equipment’s decision to withdraw from these high-risk markets and cut the support systems that keep the machines running there.

For the Kayapó, Munduruku, and Yanomami peoples, this is an important victory. Limiting access to heavy machinery is a crucial step in reducing the scale and speed of environmental devastation and the associated social impacts of illegal gold mining in their territories.

However, this decision alone will not be enough to eradicate illegal mining in the Amazon. Other machinery manufacturers whose equipment is present in these areas must adopt similar measures to ensure their products are not used to violate Indigenous rights or destroy protected forests. At the same time, the Brazilian government has a critical role to play in enforcing laws, strengthening oversight, and ensuring that illegal mining operations are dismantled rather than displaced.

The action taken by HD Hyundai Construction Equipment shows that corporate decisions can have a real impact on the ground when backed by solid evidence and public pressure. It also underscores the urgent need for broader, coordinated efforts from industry and government to protect Indigenous territories and stop illegal mining in the Amazon once and for all.
