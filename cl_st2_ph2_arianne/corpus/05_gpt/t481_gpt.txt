Europe stands at a crossroads. Our governments like to present the EU as a climate champion, but the reality is that the bloc is historically responsible for 22% of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions. With that legacy comes an obligation to lead the way in cutting pollution fast enough to help keep global heating to 1.5°C.

Right now, the draft EU Climate Law falls dangerously short of that responsibility. The current 2030 target on the table is far too weak. To have a chance of limiting warming to 1.5°C, the EU needs to commit to cutting emissions by at least 65% by 2030. Anything less locks in more climate chaos and shifts an even heavier burden onto younger generations and people in countries that have contributed least to the problem.

The draft law also fails to tackle some of the most obvious drivers of the climate crisis. Fossil fuels remain at the heart of Europe’s energy system, yet there is no clear plan to phase out the subsidies that keep coal, oil and gas artificially cheap and profitable. As long as public money continues to prop up fossil fuel companies, promises of climate leadership ring hollow.

Animal farming is another huge blind spot. It is responsible for an estimated 12–17% of the EU’s greenhouse gas emissions, but this sector is barely touched in the current proposals. Without confronting the climate impact of industrial livestock production, Europe simply cannot meet its fair share of global climate goals.

Transport is another area where the law lacks ambition. To align with climate science, the EU should be moving rapidly to end the sale of polluting cars. Yet there is no commitment to ban new petrol and diesel vehicles by 2028, a step that would send a clear signal to industry and consumers and accelerate the shift to cleaner mobility.

Even the headline-grabbing €1 trillion Sustainable Investment Plan is not the solution it appears to be. Not only is this level of funding too low for the scale of transformation required, but without strict rules it risks channelling money into projects that continue to support fossil fuels and other destructive activities. A “green” label is meaningless if the money still flows to the industries driving the crisis.

This moment is critical. The Climate Law and the broader European Green Deal could still be strengthened – but only if people across Europe demand it. National leaders will not act boldly enough unless they feel real pressure from the public.

That means turning concern into action: joining marches and demonstrations, contacting your government and Members of the European Parliament, and speaking out in your communities and workplaces. It means insisting that leaders stop tinkering at the edges and start addressing the root economic causes of the climate emergency, from fossil fuel dependence to industrial animal farming.

The decisions being taken now will shape Europe’s emissions – and its impact on the rest of the world – for decades to come. Europeans have both the power and the responsibility to push their governments toward climate policies that match the scale of the crisis. By raising our voices together, we can still turn the EU’s climate promises into real action.
