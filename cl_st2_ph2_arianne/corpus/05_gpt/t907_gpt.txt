On World Tuna Day, Greenpeace’s ship Esperanza is out in the Indian Ocean, confronting the destructive fishing practices of Thai Union, one of the world’s largest tuna companies. This is not just about a single corporation. It is about the future of tuna populations, the health of our oceans, and the wellbeing of the coastal communities that depend on them.

Thai Union owns well-known brands like John West and supplies major retailers such as Walmart. Behind the familiar cans on supermarket shelves lies an industrial fishing model that is placing enormous pressure on marine life. One of the most damaging tools used in this model is the fish aggregating device, or FAD.

FADs are floating objects that attract tuna and many other species, making them easier to catch with large nets. But this efficiency comes at a huge cost. Every year, FADs are responsible for an estimated 104,000 tonnes of bycatch in the Indian Ocean alone. That bycatch includes vulnerable species such as silky sharks, which are being killed in massive numbers simply because they are drawn to the same devices as tuna.

The problem is not only what is being caught, but who is doing the catching. Foreign industrial vessels, including those linked to Thai Union’s supply chains, are heavily exploiting tuna stocks in the Indian Ocean. These distant-water fleets compete directly with local fishers, depleting tuna populations that coastal communities rely on for food security and livelihoods. As local stocks decline, so do local incomes and the resilience of these communities.

The scale of extraction is staggering. In 2014, tuna catches in the Indian Ocean reached a record 4.8 million tonnes. At the same time, three-quarters of key tuna species such as bigeye and yellowfin were already being overfished. Continuing to fish at these levels, especially with destructive gear like FADs, pushes these species closer to collapse and undermines the long-term stability of the entire ocean ecosystem.

The damage from FADs does not end when the nets are hauled in. Many of these devices are unregulated and effectively disposable. They are constructed with plastics and often contain batteries and other electronic components. When they are lost or abandoned at sea, they become yet another source of marine pollution. FADs drift for months or years, eventually washing up on beaches and coral reefs, where they break apart and contaminate fragile habitats with plastic fragments and toxic materials.

Communities along the Indian Ocean coastline are already seeing the signs. Citizens have found fishing gear on their shores and have been able to link some of it back to Thai Union. These discoveries are a visible reminder that the impacts of industrial tuna fishing are not confined to the open ocean. They wash up on beaches, damage reefs, and intrude into the daily lives of people who had no say in how these oceans are being exploited.

Esperanza’s presence in the Indian Ocean on World Tuna Day is a direct response to this crisis. By confronting Thai Union’s destructive practices at sea, Greenpeace is standing alongside coastal communities, defending marine life, and demanding that one of the world’s biggest tuna players take responsibility for its impact. Ending the reliance on destructive FADs, protecting overfished tuna populations, and stopping the pollution of our oceans with disposable fishing gear are essential steps if we are to safeguard the future of tuna, the health of our oceans, and the communities that depend on them.
