When Greenpeace first challenged the global fashion industry to eliminate hazardous chemicals from its supply chains by 2020, the initial response was mixed. A few major sportswear brands such as Adidas, Puma, and Nike stepped forward with early commitments, while much of the sector resisted change and questioned whether toxic-free production was even realistic.

Today, the landscape looks very different. More than 70 fashion brands and retailers have now made Detox commitments, together representing around 15% of global textile production. Their progress shows that eliminating hazardous chemicals from textile manufacturing is not only possible, but already happening at scale. This shift sends a powerful message to the rest of the industry: toxic-free fashion is feasible, and delay is no longer justifiable.

To track and compare corporate performance, Greenpeace created the Detox Catwalk, which evaluates brands on three core elements: eliminating hazardous chemicals, committing to zero discharge, and ensuring transparency in their supply chains. Nineteen companies are currently ranked, and their positions show a clear divide between leaders and laggards.

At the forefront are H&M, Zara (Inditex), and Benetton, recognised as “Detox Avant-Garde.” These companies have adopted comprehensive bans on hazardous chemicals and taken significant steps toward supply-chain transparency. By disclosing information about their suppliers and pollution data, they demonstrate that openness and accountability are essential tools for driving change.

However, most of the brands assessed are not keeping pace. Sixteen companies, including well-known names such as Nike and Victoria’s Secret, fall into the “Faux Pas” or “Evolution Mode” categories. These lagging positions indicate that their actions are still too slow or incomplete to meet the urgency of the problem. While some have made commitments on paper, their implementation and transparency do not yet match the level of the leaders.

Greenpeace is calling on all brands to accelerate their efforts. With a significant share of the industry already proving that Detox is achievable, there is no excuse for half-measures or further delay. The organisation will continue to reassess corporate progress, updating the Detox Catwalk to reflect real-world performance and to keep public pressure on companies that are falling behind.

At the same time, Greenpeace is looking beyond Detox itself. Even as more brands move toward toxic-free production, there is a broader question about the long-term sustainability of a fashion system built on mass production and ever-growing consumption. Greenpeace is therefore beginning to focus on what truly sustainable, post-growth models for the fashion industry could look like—models that not only eliminate hazardous chemicals, but also move away from the logic of endless expansion.
