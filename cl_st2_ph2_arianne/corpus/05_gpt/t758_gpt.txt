On the forested slopes above the Kinder Morgan tank farm in Burnaby, British Columbia, a small wooden structure has become a powerful symbol of resistance. Indigenous leaders and their supporters have built a “Watch House” along the route of the company’s tar sands pipeline expansion, grounding their opposition in ceremony, culture, and community defense.

From this vantage point, land and water defenders are keeping vigil over a project that would move toxic tar sands bitumen from the Alberta oil sands to the Pacific coast. The pipeline lacks the free, prior and informed consent of many Indigenous communities whose lands and waters would be directly affected. For those standing in its path, the Watch House is both a place of spiritual practice and a frontline base for organizing.

Opposition to the pipeline has grown into one of the largest climate and environmental justice mobilizations in Canada in recent years. More than 10,000 people have taken to the streets to defend the coast, Indigenous rights, and the climate. Over 170 people have been arrested in acts of non-violent civil disobedience, putting their bodies on the line to stop a project they see as a direct threat to their homelands and to future generations.

The risks they are confronting are stark. The pipeline would carry heavy, polluting bitumen to the coast, where it would be loaded onto supertankers. That would mean a major increase in tanker traffic through sensitive marine ecosystems, further endangering already threatened orca populations. A spill of tar sands crude would be catastrophic for coastal waters, shorelines, and the communities and wildlife that depend on them. Once released, this heavy oil is extremely difficult to clean up, raising the specter of long-term contamination.

For many, the struggle against Kinder Morgan’s pipeline echoes the resistance at Standing Rock, where Indigenous water protectors and allies opposed the Dakota Access Pipeline. There, peaceful protesters faced militarized policing and violence. And in the wake of that mobilization, Energy Transfer Partners (ETP), the company behind the pipeline, filed a $900 million strategic lawsuit against public participation (SLAPP) against Greenpeace and others. The intent was clear: to intimidate, silence, and punish those who dared to speak out.

Instead of crushing dissent, that lawsuit has only strengthened the broader movement. Communities, organizations, and individuals have seen how far fossil fuel companies will go to protect their profits and suppress opposition. The experience at Standing Rock, and the legal attacks that followed, have deepened solidarity across struggles and borders, connecting the defense of water and land in the U.S. to the fight for Indigenous rights and a safe climate in Canada.

Those standing against Kinder Morgan’s pipeline are part of this growing, interconnected movement. They are asserting Indigenous sovereignty, defending endangered orcas and fragile marine ecosystems, and challenging the expansion of one of the world’s dirtiest fossil fuels. Their message is clear: no pipeline without consent, no sacrifice of coastal communities and wildlife to corporate interests.

Greenpeace stands with these land and water defenders and reaffirms its commitment to protecting the coast. The Watch House, the marches, and the arrests are not isolated acts of protest—they are part of a larger struggle to move away from fossil fuels, uphold Indigenous rights, and safeguard the climate and the oceans that sustain us all.
