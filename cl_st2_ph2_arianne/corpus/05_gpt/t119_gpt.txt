Climate anxiety is increasingly common, especially among young people. A 2021 study found that 84% of young people are worried about climate change, and over 45% say it affects their daily lives. For many, this isn’t an abstract concern about the future; it’s a constant emotional backdrop shaping how they think about school, work, family, and their plans for the years ahead.

At the same time, people are searching for ways to stay engaged without burning out. A growing number of podcasts now focus specifically on climate emotions and the psychological side of the crisis, offering tools, companionship, and stories that can help listeners cope and act.

One such resource is “Climate and You” by Domyo Burk. This podcast explores how we can relate to the climate crisis emotionally while remaining engaged. Rather than pushing feelings aside, it leans into them: fear, grief, anger, and even numbness. The episodes focus on how to stay involved in climate work without tipping into despair, and how acknowledging our emotions can actually support sustained action instead of shutting us down.

“Climate Change and Happiness,” hosted by Panu Pihkala and Thomas Doherty, approaches the issue from a psychological perspective. The podcast encourages listeners to articulate their fears and worries about climate change, rather than keeping them bottled up. By putting words to these feelings, the hosts suggest, people can begin to find a way through them. The conversations highlight that climate distress is a rational response to a real crisis, and that sharing this distress can make it more manageable.

Another recommendation is “How to Save A Planet,” which offers an energizing and often humorous take on climate solutions. Instead of focusing solely on problems, the podcast tells stories of people taking action. One of the best-known tools discussed on the show is Ayana Elizabeth Johnson’s climate “Venn diagram” exercise, which helps listeners identify where their skills, what they love, and what the world needs overlap. The podcast also includes episodes with Britt Wray, who brings in insights on climate-related emotions and mental health. Together, these elements make the show a source of motivation and practical ideas, while still acknowledging the emotional weight of the crisis.

“Outrage + Optimism” takes yet another approach, emphasizing the need to hold both justified anger and real hope at the same time. The podcast doesn’t shy away from the scale of the problem or the failures that fuel outrage, but it also highlights progress and possibilities. Guests such as David Attenborough and Luisa Neubauer join the hosts to discuss everything from biodiversity loss to youth climate activism. In conversations about youth climate anxiety, the show has drawn on studies of how young people are feeling and why, helping to validate those emotions while also exploring pathways forward.

For anyone struggling with climate anxiety, these podcasts offer different but complementary forms of support. Some focus on naming and processing difficult feelings; others highlight solutions, humor, and community. All of them recognize that climate anxiety is not a personal weakness but a response to a genuine global emergency—and that tending to our emotional lives can help us stay engaged for the long haul.
