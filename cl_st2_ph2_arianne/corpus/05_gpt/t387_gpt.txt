Around the world, a dangerous model of “fortress conservation” is being used to meet global biodiversity targets. Under this approach, nature is walled off and people are pushed out. Indigenous Peoples and local communities, who have often protected their lands for generations, are evicted or criminalized in the name of conservation. The result is not only injustice, but also violence.

In regions like the Congo Basin, this has led to harassment, beatings, and even murders carried out by eco-guards tasked with protecting these so-called “pristine” areas. These abuses are not accidents or isolated incidents; they are symptoms of a colonial model that treats Indigenous Peoples and local communities as obstacles instead of as rights-holders and guardians of biodiversity.

As governments rush to meet the 30x30 biodiversity targets — protecting 30% of land and sea by 2030 — there is a real risk that fortress conservation will be scaled up instead of dismantled. Without a fundamental shift, new protected areas could mean more forced evictions, more militarized conservation, and more human rights violations.

Layered onto this is the growing threat of conservation offsets. These schemes allow corporations to continue destructive activities as long as they “offset” their impacts somewhere else, often in or near Indigenous territories. This opens the door to greenwashing: companies can claim to be “nature positive” while their core business models remain rooted in extraction, pollution, and inequality. Offsets can turn forests, rivers, and grasslands into accounting entries, while the people who live with and depend on them lose control over their own territories.

Meeting biodiversity goals cannot come at the expense of human rights. It requires abandoning fortress conservation and centering the rights and leadership of Indigenous Peoples and local communities in any conservation effort. This means recognizing their land and tenure rights, ensuring their free, prior, and informed consent, and respecting their knowledge and governance systems. It also means shifting power and resources, so that communities can design, lead, and benefit from conservation on their own terms.

There are already concrete examples of what this can look like. In Mexico and Brazil, community-led protections have successfully conserved biodiversity while strengthening local rights and livelihoods. These experiences show that when communities are in charge, ecosystems can thrive without dispossession or militarization. They offer a clear alternative to colonial conservation models: one based on partnership, justice, and long-term stewardship.

But community leadership alone is not enough if the broader economic system still rewards destruction. To truly live in harmony with nature, societies must confront corporate greed and entrenched inequality. This means challenging business models that profit from deforestation, pollution, and land grabbing, and rejecting policies that treat nature as a commodity to be bought, sold, and offset.

Protecting biodiversity and defending human rights are not opposing goals — they are inseparable. Indigenous Peoples and local communities are on the frontlines of environmental protection, often at great personal risk. Supporting them, securing their rights, and following their leadership is not just the ethical path; it is the most effective way to safeguard the living world.

A just approach to conservation leaves no room for fortress walls, forced evictions, or greenwashed offsets. It starts with listening to and standing alongside the people who have been caring for their territories all along — the true guardians of biodiversity.
