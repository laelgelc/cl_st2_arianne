Greenpeace marked its 50th anniversary by turning to the creativity of its global community. To celebrate five decades of action, a worldwide design contest invited supporters to visually capture both the history of Greenpeace and its vision for the future. More than 200 designs were submitted from around the world, reflecting the diversity and passion of people who stand behind environmental protection and peace.

A panel of judges reviewed the entries, bringing together artistic and regional perspectives. Among them was Thai street artist Muebon, joined by representatives from Brazil, Hong Kong, Indonesia, the Philippines, Russia, Norway, and Africa. Together, they looked for artwork that could tell the story of Greenpeace’s journey and where the movement is headed next.

The winning design came from Barcelona-based artist Leire Dominguez. Her artwork features a peace dove whose form creates the number “50,” emerging from a Greenpeace ship. This image links the organization’s early anti-nuclear actions at sea with its broader fight for environmental justice today. The ship and dove together evoke Greenpeace’s roots in direct action and its ongoing commitment to peace, while the “50” marks a milestone that is as much about the future as the past.

Among the shortlisted artists was Russian creator Nickolay Drozdovskiy, whose work was inspired by the idea of planetary protection. His piece stood out to the judges as one of the designs that powerfully captured the urgency and global scale of environmental defense.

This anniversary contest is only part of the celebration. More 50th anniversary activities are planned, along with further recognition of the many shortlisted artists whose work helped tell the Greenpeace story in new ways.
