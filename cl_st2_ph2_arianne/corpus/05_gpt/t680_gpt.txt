Andreas Randøy is part of a new generation in Norway that refuses to accept business as usual in the middle of a climate crisis. As a young activist with Nature and Youth and Greenpeace, he has seen how climate change is no longer a distant threat but a lived reality, with impacts such as farming disasters already hitting communities.

Inspired by Greta Thunberg and the wave of youth climate action she helped spark, Andreas helped organize school strikes in Norway. Nearly 1,000 students took part, walking out of their classrooms to demand that decision-makers take the climate crisis seriously. For Andreas and many other young people, striking from school is not about skipping lessons, but about insisting that there is no point in education if leaders ignore the scientific warnings and fail to protect their future.

His activism has gone beyond the streets and into the courtroom. Together with others, Andreas helped take the Norwegian government to court over its decision to allow new oil drilling in the Arctic. They argued that expanding oil extraction violates the environmental rights enshrined in Norway’s constitution. Although they lost in the first round of the case, they chose to appeal, determined to keep pushing the legal system to recognize that a safe environment is a fundamental right, not an optional extra.

Andreas’s work also exposes a contradiction at the heart of Norway’s international reputation. The country is often seen as a global environmental leader, yet it remains one of the world’s major exporters of oil. This tension is central to his message: a green image cannot hide the reality of continued fossil fuel expansion.

When confronted with the familiar argument that oil is necessary to protect jobs, Andreas responds that alternatives already exist. He points to the possibilities in renewable energy and other sustainable industries, insisting that workers and communities can be supported through a transition away from fossil fuels. For him and many of his peers, the choice is not between jobs and the climate, but between clinging to an outdated, polluting system and building a fairer, cleaner future.

At the heart of Andreas’s activism is a vision shared by many young people: a rapid shift to renewable energy and a society that respects planetary boundaries. He calls for action not only for Norway’s sake, but for global climate justice. The decisions made in an oil-rich country like Norway affect people far beyond its borders, especially those who are already on the frontlines of climate impacts.

By striking from school, challenging the government in court, and speaking out against the expansion of Arctic oil, Andreas and his generation are demanding that leaders live up to their responsibilities. Their message is clear: the time for half-measures is over, and a just, renewable future must be built now.
