Around the world, fire seasons are becoming longer, more intense, and more destructive as the climate crisis drives temperatures higher and dries out forests and other ecosystems. What were once occasional, seasonal events are turning into recurring disasters that threaten people’s lives, health, homes, and fundamental rights.

In Siberia, extreme heat has collided with a deeply fragile landscape. Rising temperatures are not only drying out vast forest areas, they are also thawing permafrost. This has contributed to oil spills and created conditions where fires can burn unchecked. Unfought and often remote, these blazes have already consumed more than 22 million hectares, turning immense stretches of land into burn scars and releasing huge amounts of smoke and pollution.

In Brazil, fires are being deliberately set to clear land for agriculture. These are not accidental blazes; they are part of a destructive model of land use that treats forests as expendable obstacles. Policies under President Jair Bolsonaro have further encouraged this expansion, weakening protections and emboldening those who profit from deforestation. The result is a wave of fires that threatens Indigenous Peoples and their territories, undermining their rights, cultures, and ways of life while destroying some of the most biodiverse ecosystems on Earth.

Argentina is facing its own fire crises. In the Paraná Delta and the province of Córdoba, fires are being intentionally lit to convert land for farming and real estate development. Severe drought has made these landscapes even more vulnerable, turning planned burns into out-of-control infernos. What might be framed as economic development is, in practice, the large-scale sacrifice of wetlands, grasslands, and other vital ecosystems, along with the communities and species that depend on them.

On the west coast of the United States, California has been engulfed by massive wildfires driven by record-breaking heatwaves and sparked by lightning strikes. These fires have forced tens of thousands of people to evacuate, destroyed homes and infrastructure, and blanketed entire regions in thick, toxic smoke. The crisis has unfolded in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, worsening air quality and compounding health risks, especially for those already vulnerable. Black, Brown, and Indigenous communities are disproportionately affected, bearing the brunt of pollution, displacement, and the long-term consequences of environmental injustice.

Across these regions, a common pattern emerges: rising temperatures and drought linked to the climate crisis are intensifying fire seasons, while political decisions, destructive economic models, and systemic inequalities make the impacts far worse. Forests, wetlands, and other ecosystems are being pushed to the brink at the very moment when we need them most—for climate stability, clean air and water, and the protection of communities.

The path forward demands bold action at both local and global levels. Governments must stop policies and practices that drive deforestation, environmental degradation, and fossil fuel expansion. Indigenous rights and land protections must be upheld and strengthened, recognizing the crucial role Indigenous Peoples play in safeguarding forests and ecosystems. Emergency responses to fires must prioritize the health, safety, and rights of affected communities, with particular attention to those who are most exposed and least protected.

Protecting forests and people in an age of escalating fires is not optional—it is essential. The climate crisis is already reshaping our world, and the fires raging from Siberia to Brazil, Argentina to California are a stark warning. Acting now, with urgency and justice at the center, is the only way to prevent even more devastating fire seasons in the years ahead.
