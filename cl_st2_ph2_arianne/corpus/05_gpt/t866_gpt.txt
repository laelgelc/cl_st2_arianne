The air we breathe is a delicate mix of gases that sustains life. When this balance is disrupted by pollution, it directly affects our health. Polluted air is linked to respiratory problems, asthma, cardiovascular disease, and lung cancer. According to the World Health Organization, air pollution is responsible for 7 million premature deaths every year. These are not abstract numbers—they reflect the daily reality of people living in some of the most polluted places in the world.

Bulgaria ranks among the European Union’s most polluted countries. In cities like Stara Zagora, people are often exposed to dangerous levels of dust and particulate matter in the air. Yet pollution is frequently invisible, and official monitoring is often limited or inaccessible. Without clear, local information, it is difficult for communities to understand what they are breathing and to demand change.

To address this, Greenpeace Bulgaria launched the “Dustcounters” project in Stara Zagora. The goal is simple but powerful: give people the tools to measure the air around them. Using Arduino-based technology, the team developed affordable, open-source, do-it-yourself devices that measure local dust and particulate matter. These devices can be assembled and used by citizens themselves, helping to turn abstract concerns about pollution into concrete, measurable data.

The Dustcounters devices feed their measurements into a shared database, with the results made publicly available on the Greenpeace Bulgaria website. This transparency allows residents, activists, and decision-makers to see when and where pollution spikes, and to connect those patterns to everyday activities and local sources. In a country heavily affected by pollution from fossil fuels, such data is crucial for exposing the true scale of the problem.

By the end of February, Greenpeace Bulgaria plans to analyze the collected results. These findings will guide the development of an improved “Dustcounters 2.0” in 2017. The next generation of devices is intended to deepen understanding of how fossil fuel use contributes to air pollution and to strengthen the case for cleaner alternatives.

The Dustcounters project is not just about technology; it is about empowerment. When communities can monitor their own air, they can better protect their health and push for solutions. In a place where pollution is a daily threat, collective efforts to reduce emissions become both urgent and possible.
