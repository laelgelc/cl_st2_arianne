Around the world, people came together on World Oceans Day to send a simple, powerful message: our oceans need protection.

From city streets to sandy shores, supporters painted themselves blue and joined in human waves, using fun and creativity to call on world leaders to safeguard the seas. In 25 countries across all seven continents – from Russia and Senegal to New Zealand, Chile, Bulgaria, Thailand, and even Antarctica – people stood up for the oceans that sustain life on our planet.

These waves of blue were more than just a celebration. They were a signal to decision-makers that people everywhere care deeply about the health of our oceans and want urgent action to protect them.

You can explore moments from these actions by browsing the photo gallery of events from around the globe and seeing how communities brought the oceans to life in their own unique ways.
