COP27 is the first climate summit to put a strong emphasis on food and agriculture, yet critical discussions on biodiversity are still uncertain. At the same time, Indigenous Peoples are calling for genuine inclusion in decision-making spaces to protect the earth, even as they continue to face serious challenges on the ground and at the negotiating table.

Across Africa, rising grain prices are driving a deepening food crisis. In response, a ministerial panel at COP27 underscored the need to move away from monoculture-based food systems and towards agroecological solutions that support small-scale farmers and local communities. These approaches are being highlighted as key to building resilience, strengthening food sovereignty, and reducing dependence on volatile global commodity markets.

Despite this, the countries most responsible for pollution are stalling progress on the financial mechanisms urgently needed for adaptation, mitigation, and addressing loss and damage. By delaying decisions on funding, they are evading responsibility for their historical and ongoing emissions, leaving vulnerable communities to bear the brunt of climate impacts without the resources they need.

The situation demands immediate action. Global funds must be put in place and made accessible, and technical exchanges must be strengthened to share knowledge and support real solutions on the ground. Ending deforestation and industrial fishing is essential to protect ecosystems, biodiversity, and the livelihoods that depend on them.

Within the negotiations, advancing work under Article 6.8 and the Koronivia Joint Work on Agriculture is crucial to ensure that non-market approaches, food systems, and agriculture are addressed in a way that supports people and the planet rather than corporate interests. Above all, Indigenous Peoples must be meaningfully involved in these processes. Their participation and leadership are vital to shaping outcomes at COP27 that can positively influence the decisions taken at COP15 on biodiversity.

The choices made now on finance, food systems, and Indigenous rights will determine whether these summits respond to the intertwined crises of climate, food, and biodiversity with the urgency and justice they require.
