Unprecedented wildfires are tearing through eastern Russia, with Siberia’s Yakutia region at the epicenter of a crisis that is unfolding on a staggering scale. More than 300 active fires are burning across an area of 17.08 million hectares—an expanse larger than all other wildfires on the planet combined right now. These fires are being driven by record heat and severe drought, and they are transforming vast stretches of forest into smoke and ash.

The impacts are being felt far beyond the fire zones. Smoke from these fires has traveled extraordinary distances, reaching the North Pole, Mongolia, Canada, and Greenland. In affected regions, cities are shrouded in thick haze, visibility is collapsing, and pollution levels are surging. Roads and airports have been forced to close, and communities are being evacuated as conditions become too dangerous to stay. For many local people, daily life has been upended by toxic air, disrupted transport, and the constant threat that the flames will spread.

Northern Siberia is warming three times faster than the global average. This rapid heating is drying out forests and peatlands, making them far more vulnerable to ignition and harder to control once they catch fire. In this context, the current fire season is not an isolated disaster but part of a dangerous trend. If conditions continue, the scale of burning could surpass the previous record set in 2012, deepening the damage to ecosystems, wildlife, and human health.

In response, Greenpeace Russia is calling for systemic change through its Green Deal, which focuses on sustainable forestry and robust fire protection. The proposal emphasizes that forests must be managed in ways that reduce fire risk, protect biodiversity, and maintain their crucial role in stabilizing the climate. This includes strengthening fire-prevention systems and ensuring that fires are detected and tackled quickly, before they can grow into mega-fires.

Greenpeace Russia is urging governments to act on multiple fronts at once: cut greenhouse gas emissions to address the root causes of climate heating; restore degraded nature so that forests and landscapes are more resilient; halt cutbacks in forest protection that leave ecosystems exposed and response systems weakened; and support local communities and firefighters with urgent, practical measures. These include providing the resources, equipment, and backing needed to protect people and nature on the frontlines of the crisis.

The wildfires in Yakutia and across eastern Russia are a stark warning of what unchecked climate change and weakened environmental protections mean in practice: vast areas of forest on fire, smoke circling the globe, and communities struggling to breathe and to stay safe. The choices governments make now—to reduce emissions, safeguard forests, and support those on the ground—will determine whether this becomes the new normal or a turning point toward a safer, more resilient future.
