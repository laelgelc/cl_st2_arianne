In the darkness of the Indian Ocean, high-powered lights mounted on the Explorer II vessel cut through the water, drawing in marine life from far and wide. These lights, used to support industrial fishing operations and fish aggregating practices, became the focus of a bold Greenpeace action at sea.

Greenpeace activists, operating from the ship Esperanza, used water-based black paint to disable these powerful lights. This was a direct protest against the vessel’s fish-aggregating practices, which potentially breached regulations and contributed to destructive industrial fishing. By blacking out the lights, activists intervened in the very tools used to lure marine life into the nets of large-scale fishing operations.

The Esperanza’s crew has gone further than confronting a single vessel. At sea, they have removed dozens of fish aggregating devices (FADs) that contribute to overfishing and the depletion of marine ecosystems. Working alongside and supporting local Malagasy fishermen, they have highlighted the stark contrast between industrial fleets and the coastal communities who rely on healthy oceans for their livelihoods. At the same time, the crew has directly confronted destructive fishing operations that threaten both marine biodiversity and food security.

Following the action against the Explorer II, the type of high-powered lights it used was banned, showing how targeted interventions at sea can help drive concrete changes in fishing practices.

This work in the Indian Ocean is part of a much broader global campaign to transform the tuna industry and hold major corporations to account. Around the world, Greenpeace has taken action in multiple countries to expose and disrupt destructive fishing and supply chains linked to companies like Thai Union.

In New Zealand and France, Greenpeace’s efforts have contributed to factory shutdowns connected to problematic tuna supply chains. In Thailand, activists have used laser projections to publicly challenge corporate practices and shine a literal spotlight on the impacts of industrial fishing. Campaigners have also developed barcode matching that links products on supermarket shelves back to FADs, helping to reveal the hidden story behind a can of tuna and the fishing methods used to catch it.

These efforts have reached into supermarkets across several countries, where Thai Union tuna has been cleared from shelves in response to pressure from Greenpeace and concerned consumers. The message is clear: companies cannot ignore the environmental and social impacts of their supply chains.

The campaign is intensifying. Greenpeace is increasing pressure on major retailers that sell tuna products linked to destructive fishing, with more actions planned targeting companies such as Walmart and Sainsbury’s. By pushing these powerful retailers to demand better practices from their suppliers, Greenpeace aims to help shift the entire tuna industry toward methods that protect oceans, workers, and coastal communities.

From disabling illegal or harmful fishing tools at sea to driving corporate change on land, this campaign shows how coordinated global action can challenge destructive fishing and defend our oceans.
