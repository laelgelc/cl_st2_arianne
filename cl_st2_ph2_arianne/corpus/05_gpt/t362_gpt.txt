Every year on 11 February, the International Day of Women and Girls in Science is a reminder that science is still far from equal. Women remain underrepresented, making up less than 30% of researchers worldwide, and only 7% of 15-year-old girls say they aspire to technical professions. These numbers are not just statistics; they reflect lost perspectives, lost talent, and lost opportunities to tackle the interconnected crises facing our planet.

Within Greenpeace campaigns, women scientists are playing a central role in confronting some of the greatest environmental challenges of our time: climate change, the protection of our oceans, and understanding the links between COVID-19 and biodiversity loss. Their work is helping to show how environmental destruction is not only a planetary emergency, but also a public health issue.

Argentinian ecologist Sandra Myrna Díaz has described biodiversity as a tapestry, where each species is a thread. As threads are pulled out, the tapestry weakens. Applied to disease, this metaphor helps explain how biodiversity loss can increase the risk of transmission. When ecosystems are intact, a wide variety of species can dilute and buffer disease dynamics. But as habitats are destroyed and species disappear, the balance is disrupted, and the pathways for pathogens to spread between animals and humans can become more direct and more frequent. Protecting biodiversity is therefore also about preventing future pandemics.

On the frontlines of ocean protection, women scientists are helping Greenpeace build the evidence needed to secure strong global agreements. Soon, a new expedition will set sail on the Greenpeace ship Arctic Sunrise, led by marine scientist Kirsten Thompson. The team will head to the Saya de Malha Bank in the Indian Ocean, one of the largest submerged banks in the world, to study its coral reefs, seagrass meadows, and the marine life that depends on them.

Using tools like environmental DNA (eDNA), underwater photography, and acoustic monitoring, the expedition will document the rich life in this remote area. eDNA will help reveal which species are present simply by sampling the water; cameras will capture visual records of habitats and animals; and acoustic equipment will listen in on the hidden soundscape of marine life. Together, these methods will help build a picture of an ecosystem that is largely unseen and under-researched, but crucial for ocean health.

This scientific evidence is vital in the push for a strong Global Ocean Treaty that can protect at least 30% of the world’s oceans by 2030. By showing what is at stake in places like Saya de Malha, the expedition aims to strengthen the case for a network of fully and highly protected ocean sanctuaries, free from destructive human activities.

Marking the International Day of Women and Girls in Science means recognising the women whose expertise drives this work forward, and acknowledging the barriers that still hold many back. Empowering women in science is not only a matter of justice and equality; it is also essential for safeguarding biodiversity, preventing future pandemics, and winning the protections our oceans so urgently need.
