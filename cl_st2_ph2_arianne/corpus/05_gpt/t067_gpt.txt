Indigenous leaders from Canada, Brazil, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Indonesia came to COP15 in Montreal to demand that their rights be fully recognized in the final global biodiversity agreement. Their goal was clear: ensure that any deal to protect nature also acknowledges Indigenous Peoples’ central role in caring for lands, waters, and ecosystems.

Their efforts contributed to a key outcome of the summit: the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework recognizes Indigenous knowledge and practices as essential for protecting biodiversity. This recognition reflects what Indigenous communities have long asserted—that their ways of life and stewardship are fundamental to sustaining the natural world.

Reaching Montreal was not easy. Many Indigenous representatives faced serious obstacles, including visa delays that made participation uncertain or difficult. Despite these barriers, they made their presence felt throughout the summit. They joined marches in the streets, spoke at press conferences, and even interrupted official speeches to call out their exclusion from the heart of negotiations.

Again and again, they emphasized that traditional knowledge—not just new technology—must guide efforts to halt biodiversity loss. They denounced being sidelined from decision-making spaces, insisting that those who have protected biodiversity for generations must not be left outside the rooms where global commitments are shaped.

One of the defining moments of COP15 was a historic march of more than 3,500 people through Montreal. At its center was the leadership of Indigenous women, whose role in defending nature and rights was made highly visible. Their presence underscored how struggles for biodiversity, land, and human rights are deeply connected, and how Indigenous women are on the frontlines of these intertwined fights.

By the end of COP15, Indigenous leaders had pushed the global conversation forward. Their voices helped ensure that the new biodiversity framework does not only set targets for nature, but also explicitly recognizes the knowledge, practices, and leadership of the peoples who have safeguarded biodiversity for countless generations.
