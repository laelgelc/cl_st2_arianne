A new UN report from Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food, Hilal Elver, sends a clear message: pesticides are not just an environmental issue, they are a global human rights concern. By undermining the right to food, they are directly linked to violations of fundamental rights and the integrity of our food systems.

The report dismantles one of the most powerful myths in modern agriculture – that pesticides are essential to “feed the world.” Instead, it shows how the so‑called Green Revolution has primarily enriched powerful corporations while driving a cascade of harms: massive food waste, persistent hunger, climate change, biodiversity loss, and deepening social and economic inequality. Rather than solving hunger, this chemical-intensive model has entrenched it, especially for the most vulnerable communities.

At the heart of the report is a strong endorsement of agroecology as a real, viable alternative. Agroecology offers a sustainable way to produce food that respects ecosystems and human rights, instead of treating nature and people as expendable inputs. It is presented not as a niche option, but as a central pathway to transform food and farming systems away from dependence on hazardous pesticides.

The report also calls for concrete political action. It recommends a new, legally binding global treaty on hazardous pesticides to end the current patchwork of weak and uneven protections. It urges governments to adopt clear national targets to reduce pesticide use and to support civil society in educating farmers and communities about agroecology and non-chemical farming methods. These steps are framed as essential to protect the right to food and to move away from a model that sacrifices health and the environment for profit.

A major focus is the role of pesticide corporations. The report highlights their double standards and unethical marketing practices, including aggressively promoting products while denying or downplaying their harms. It points to an estimated 200,000 deaths from pesticide poisoning every year as a stark example of the human cost. At the same time, these corporations are described as exerting powerful influence over governments, lobbying to obstruct meaningful reforms and delay the transition to safer, more just food systems.

The conclusion is unambiguous: politicians must act. Ending corporate influence over public policy is presented as a prerequisite for protecting human rights, safeguarding the right to food, and enabling the shift to agroecology. Without decisive political will to rein in hazardous pesticides and the corporations that profit from them, the cycle of poisoning, inequality, and environmental destruction will continue. The report calls on governments to choose a different path—one that prioritizes people and the planet over corporate interests.
