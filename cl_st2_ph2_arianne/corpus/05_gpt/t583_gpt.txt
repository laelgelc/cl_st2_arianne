The recent HBO series on Chernobyl has captured global attention for its stark, meticulous portrayal of the 1986 nuclear disaster. Viewers and critics have praised its attention to period detail, from the clothing and architecture to the pervasive lack of awareness among residents about the scale and nature of the catastrophe unfolding around them. This realism has pushed the series to the top of IMDb’s rankings, reflecting how powerfully it has resonated with audiences worldwide.

But while the series has brought Chernobyl back into public consciousness, the disaster itself is far from a closed chapter. The explosion at Reactor 4 of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant led to the evacuation of around 350,000 people from affected areas. Entire towns and villages were emptied, and communities were uprooted, many of them never to return to their homes.

Decades on, the consequences of that night are still being lived every day. Around 5 million people continue to reside in territories contaminated by radioactive fallout. For them, Chernobyl is not history—it is an ongoing reality woven into the land they farm, the forests they walk in, and the food they eat.

The human health impacts remain a deeply contested and painful subject. The World Health Organization (WHO) has estimated that around 9,000 additional deaths may result from radiation exposure linked to the disaster. Research by Greenpeace, however, suggests the toll could be far higher, with up to 100,000 deaths from cancers exacerbated by radiation. Behind each number are families, stories, and communities that have had to confront illness, uncertainty, and loss over multiple generations.

Despite the scale of this legacy, reactors similar to the one that exploded at Chernobyl have not entirely disappeared. Ten reactors of a similar type are still in operation in Russia. Their existence underscores that the risks highlighted so dramatically in the HBO series are not only historical, but also embedded in today’s energy systems.

In towns like Novozybkov, the long shadow of Chernobyl is visible in everyday life. People continue to gather mushrooms and berries from local forests—foods that can accumulate radioactive contamination—and sell them at markets. This happens even after decontamination efforts, reflecting both economic necessity and the difficulty of fully erasing radioactive pollution from ecosystems. For many, there is no realistic alternative source of income or sustenance.

The story that emerges, both from the real Chernobyl and its television portrayal, is one of profound and enduring cost. When nuclear power goes wrong, the consequences are not confined to a single moment or a single site. They are carried by ordinary people—those evacuated from their homes, those still living on contaminated land, and those whose health may be affected years or decades later. These burdens stretch across time, passed from one generation to the next, long after the world’s attention has moved on.
