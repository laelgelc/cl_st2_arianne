The Paris Agreement set a clear and urgent goal: limit global warming to 1.5°C. Achieving this means transforming how we produce energy, move around, grow food, and run our economies. Every sector must play its part, and every delay makes the task harder.

In the electricity sector, change is already visible. Renewables are rapidly expanding, and in the EU they now provide over 20% of all power. This is a significant step away from fossil fuels and shows that with the right policies and investments, cleaner options can scale quickly.

But while electricity is moving in the right direction, transport is heading the other way. Emissions from the transport sector are rising, driven in large part by growing car sales. A major contributor is the surge in sales of heavier, more polluting vehicles like SUVs. This trend is undermining progress made elsewhere and pushing the transport sector further from a path compatible with the 1.5°C limit.

A study commissioned by Greenpeace and carried out by German researchers warns that simply relying on the current pace of electric vehicle (EV) adoption will not be enough. According to their findings, if Europe continues on its present course, the transport sector will blow through its remaining carbon budget. To keep within that budget and stay aligned with the 1.5°C goal, the study concludes that sales of new petrol and diesel cars in Europe must end by 2028.

This is a tight deadline, but there are already examples showing how rapidly change can happen with strong political will and smart policy design. Norway stands out as a leading case. Through a wide range of incentives and supportive measures, it has seen electric vehicles move from niche to normal in just a few years. Norway has set a target that all new cars sold by 2025 should be zero-emission, and its rapid EV growth demonstrates what is possible when governments make clean choices easier and more attractive for people.

At the same time, shifting to electric cars alone will not deliver a truly sustainable transport system. Even zero-emission vehicles take up space, require resources, and depend on infrastructure. A broader rethinking of mobility is needed. That means creating safe, extensive bike lanes so more people can choose cycling. It means investing in affordable, reliable public transport so that buses, trams, and trains become the backbone of daily travel. And it means supporting car sharing and other shared mobility options, reducing the need for every household to own a private car.

The Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C goal demands that we transform transport as decisively as we are transforming electricity. Phasing out new petrol and diesel cars by 2028 in Europe, accelerating the shift to electric vehicles, and redesigning our cities and systems around bikes, public transport, and shared mobility are all part of the same urgent task: cutting emissions fast enough to keep a safe and liveable climate within reach.
