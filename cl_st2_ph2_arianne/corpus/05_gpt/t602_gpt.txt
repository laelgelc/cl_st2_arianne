On 1 May, the UK Parliament declared a climate emergency, a moment that followed weeks of extraordinary disruption in London. Extinction Rebellion protests had occupied streets, bridges and public spaces, forcing the climate crisis into headlines and daily conversations. Their actions, widely supported by people from many walks of life, pushed politicians to acknowledge what scientists and campaigners have been warning for decades: we are running out of time.

The emergency declaration did not emerge in a vacuum. It came against a backdrop of mounting scientific warnings that the planetary biosphere is shifting in ways that could become irreversible. Researchers have been sounding the alarm on runaway global heating, accelerating biodiversity loss and the possibility that human civilisation could be pushed toward collapse or even extinction if current trends continue.

Essays such as Catherine Ingram’s “Facing Extinction” have helped bring these warnings into stark emotional and moral focus. Ingram explores what it means to look honestly at the possibility of human extinction and the unraveling of the living world. Rather than offering false comfort, she invites readers to confront the depth of the crisis and the grief that comes with recognising how much has already been lost, and how much more is at stake.

Similarly, Dr. William Rees has examined how certain human behavioural traits have contributed to our current predicament. His analysis points to our tendency toward short-term gratification, our difficulty planning for long-term, abstract threats, and our collective overshoot of Earth’s capacity to sustain us. These traits, which once may have been adaptive in small, local contexts, now collide with a globalised, industrial society whose scale and speed magnify their destructive potential.

Layered on top of these evolutionary biases is the myth of endless economic growth. The dominant capitalist model treats perpetual expansion of production and consumption as both natural and necessary. This growth imperative has driven the extraction and burning of fossil fuels, the clearing of forests, the depletion of oceans and soils, and the commodification of ecosystems. Even as evidence of ecological breakdown has accumulated, the story that more growth will somehow solve the problems caused by growth itself has remained deeply entrenched.

The May 1 declaration, then, can be seen as a political system finally beginning to respond—however hesitantly—to realities that have been visible for a long time. Ecologists, climate scientists and frontline communities have been issuing alerts for decades about destabilising climate patterns, collapsing species populations and the breaching of planetary boundaries. Yet these repeated warnings were largely sidelined in favour of short-term economic and political gains.

What is different now is the force and clarity of youth-led movements that refuse to accept this trajectory. Young people, from school strikers to university organisers, are insisting that survival must come before profit and that their futures are not bargaining chips. Their demands go beyond incremental policy tweaks; they are calling for a fundamental overhaul of how societies organise energy, food, transport, work and care.

Extinction Rebellion’s mass actions in London drew energy from this youth-led surge. Together, they challenged the assumption that “business as usual” can continue in the face of climate breakdown. By disrupting daily life, they exposed the fragility of systems we take for granted and made visible the gap between political rhetoric and the scale of change scientists say is necessary.

The UK Parliament’s climate emergency declaration is one response to this pressure. While symbolic on its own, it signals a shift in public discourse: the climate crisis is no longer framed as a distant or secondary issue, but as an immediate threat to the conditions that support life. It acknowledges, however cautiously, that the status quo is incompatible with a safe, liveable future.

Behind the parliamentary speeches and media headlines lies a stark choice. The scientific literature, the reflections of thinkers like Ingram and Rees, and the moral clarity of youth movements all converge on the same point: continuing on our current path courts biosphere destabilisation, deepening inequality and the risk of societal breakdown. Changing course will require confronting our short-term biases, questioning the myths that underpin our economies, and listening to those who have been warning of ecological limits for generations.

The protests that shook London and the declaration that followed are part of a growing recognition that survival demands more than minor adjustments. They mark a moment when the clash between an overheating planet and a growth-obsessed system became impossible to ignore. Whether this moment becomes a turning point depends on what comes next: whether societies are willing to undertake the profound transformations that young people, scientists and movements around the world are now urgently demanding.
