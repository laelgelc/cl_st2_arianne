When we picture a beehive, we often think of a single queen surrounded by countless workers. Yet every queen and every worker bee begins exactly the same way: as an egg laid in a tiny cell. What determines whether that egg becomes a powerful queen or a tireless worker is not its genetics, but its diet.

Larvae destined to become queens are fed royal jelly for a longer period than worker larvae. This prolonged consumption of royal jelly transforms their bodies and their futures. Queens grow larger, live much longer than worker bees, and gain the ability to lay millions of eggs over their lifetimes. Worker bees, in contrast, receive royal jelly only briefly before being switched to a different diet. They remain smaller, live shorter lives, and take on all the other roles that keep the colony functioning.

Bees have been closely connected to human life on the Korean Peninsula for a very long time. Records trace Korean beekeeping back to the Three Kingdoms period, from where it spread and developed over centuries. As beekeeping took root, bees came to symbolize diligence in Korean culture, embodying steady effort, cooperation, and productivity.

Today, however, the bees that have long been part of Korean landscapes and livelihoods are under threat. By early 2022, Korea’s honeybee population had already declined by 16%. This sharp drop is linked to multiple, overlapping pressures: the climate crisis, parasites, pesticides, and the loss of plants that bees depend on. Faced with this alarming trend, Greenpeace Korea is calling for the government to establish a dedicated committee to respond to the honeybee crisis and protect these vital pollinators.

To understand what is at stake, it helps to look more closely at who bees are and how they live. Bees evolved from carnivorous ancestors around 100 million years ago. Over that immense span of time, they shifted from meat-eating to a life centered on flowers, feeding on nectar and pollen from honey plants. Their bodies and behaviors evolved in step with flowering plants, creating the intricate relationships we see today between bees and blossoms.

A bee’s world is experienced through remarkable senses. Honeybees have five eyes: two large compound eyes and three smaller simple eyes. These help them navigate, find flowers, and orient themselves in relation to the sun. Inside the hive, communication is just as remarkable. Bees use dances to share information and make collective decisions. Through these movements, they can signal the direction and distance of food sources, helping the colony coordinate its foraging.

Life inside the hive is highly organized, and worker bees follow a kind of age-based career path. Young workers begin with tasks inside the hive, such as caring for larvae or cleaning. As they grow older, they take on new responsibilities, eventually graduating to foraging outside for nectar and pollen. Their lifespans also vary by season: bees born in different times of year live for different lengths of time, reflecting the changing demands and conditions they face.

All of this effort fuels the production of honey, but the amount of work required for even a small quantity is immense. Bees must visit many flowers and make extensive foraging trips to collect enough nectar and pollen. The honey we see in jars is the end result of countless flights, coordinated dances, and the labor of an entire colony.

Bees are more than just honey producers. They are ancient partners of flowering plants, long-standing companions in Korean history, and living symbols of diligence. As their numbers fall, the need for action grows clearer. Protecting bees means recognizing their value, understanding the pressures they face, and supporting measures—like a dedicated government committee—that can help ensure their survival in a rapidly changing climate.
