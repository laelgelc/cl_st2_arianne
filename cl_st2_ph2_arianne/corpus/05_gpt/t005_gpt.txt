In a beehive, every bee has a role, but two types stand out: queens and workers. Both start from the same kind of egg, yet their lives diverge dramatically because of what they eat. A queen bee is fed royal jelly for an extended period, while worker bees only receive it briefly after hatching. This difference in diet shapes their bodies and their destinies. The queen becomes larger, lives much longer, and has the extraordinary ability to lay millions of eggs over her lifetime. Worker bees, in contrast, remain smaller, live shorter lives, and take on the many tasks needed to keep the hive running.

The relationship between people on the Korean Peninsula and bees has deep roots. Beekeeping in Korea dates back to the Three Kingdoms period. Over time, beekeeping spread widely and bees came to symbolize qualities like diligence and wealth. Honey and beeswax were valuable resources, and the image of bees working tirelessly together resonated with cultural values of hard work and prosperity.

Today, this long relationship is under serious threat. In 2022, Korea lost 16% of its honeybees. This is not a small fluctuation: it is a warning signal. Multiple pressures are converging on these insects. The climate crisis is changing temperatures and seasons, disrupting flowering times and the conditions bees depend on. Parasites weaken and kill colonies. There are fewer honey plants available, reducing food sources for bees. Pesticides add yet another layer of stress and danger. Together, these factors are pushing bees toward crisis, and with them, the ecosystems and food systems that rely on pollination.

To respond to this emergency, Greenpeace Korea is calling for the establishment of a “Save the Honeybees Committee.” Such a committee would focus attention and action on protecting bees, recognizing that their decline is closely linked to the broader climate and ecological crisis. Protecting bees means protecting the web of life they support and, ultimately, human food security.

Honeybees themselves are remarkable beings, and understanding them can deepen our sense of why they matter. They did not start out as gentle pollinators. Bees evolved from carnivorous ancestors, gradually shifting to a life centered on flowers and nectar. Their bodies are finely tuned to this role, even down to their five eyes: three simple eyes on the top of the head and two large compound eyes on the sides, helping them navigate and communicate.

Inside the hive, decisions are not simply dictated from above. Honeybees are known for making democratic decisions, especially when choosing new nest sites. They communicate options and preferences through dances, and through this process, the colony reaches a collective decision. This same dance language is used by foragers to share information about where food can be found.

Work in the hive is divided by age. Young bees start with tasks inside the nest, such as cleaning cells and caring for larvae. As they grow older, they take on roles like building comb, guarding the entrance, and finally, foraging outside. Their lifespans also shift with the seasons. Bees born in times of intense work may live only weeks, while those born to overwinter can live much longer, bridging one season to the next.

All of this activity depends on honey plants. Without enough flowering plants that provide nectar and pollen, bees cannot sustain their colonies. For every spoonful of honey we consume, countless trips have been made by foraging bees, each visit gathering tiny amounts of nectar that together become the honey stored in the hive. This effort is not only for our benefit; it is how bees feed themselves and their young. But in doing so, they pollinate the plants that feed many other species, including humans.

The story of bees in Korea connects ancient history, cultural values, and the urgent realities of the climate crisis. The differences between queen and worker, the long tradition of beekeeping, the recent loss of 16% of honeybees, and the many fascinating facts about bee biology and behavior all point in the same direction: bees are indispensable, and they are in danger. Acting now to protect them, through measures like a “Save the Honeybees Committee,” is not just about preserving one insect species. It is about safeguarding an entire living system that has supported human societies for centuries.
