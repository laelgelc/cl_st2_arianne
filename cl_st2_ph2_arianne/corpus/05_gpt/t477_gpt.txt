Climate activism used to feel simple to me. It was loud, energizing, and even fun: marching in the streets, chanting with friends, holding signs that said exactly what we believed. The work felt straightforward—show up, speak out, demand change.

Over time, that changed. The movement I love became more complex, and so did my role in it. The strikes and rallies were still there, but they were joined by policy briefings, coordinating volunteers, handling media requests, and navigating the constant stream of news about the worsening climate crisis. The urgency that first pushed me into activism began to mix with stress, exhaustion, and a creeping sense of anxiety.

Some days, the weight of it all made me wonder how anyone keeps going. I found myself thinking about people like Kotchakorn Voraakhom, whose work as a landscape architect is closely tied to climate resilience. I wondered whether she ever feels hopeless, whether she ever looks at the scale of the crisis and thinks it’s too much. But what stands out to me is that she, like so many others, continues anyway. That persistence became something I held on to.

A lot of how I cope with these feelings comes from my mother. She has always approached problems as puzzles to be solved rather than walls to crash into. Growing up with that mindset, I learned to look for possibilities even in situations that feel overwhelming. Instead of letting the stress of activism shut me down, I began to ask: how can I turn this into something meaningful?

That question led me toward storytelling. I realized that my activism didn’t have to be limited to organizing or attending protests. I could merge my advocacy with the things I love—writing, film, and photography—and use them to communicate what the climate crisis feels like, not just what it is. Through stories, I could explore the emotional landscape of activism: the fear, the fatigue, the determination, and the hope that refuses to fully disappear.

This shift didn’t erase the difficulties, but it did give them a purpose. Policy work and public communication still feel heavy at times, but when I see them as part of a larger narrative I’m helping to tell, they become more manageable. They turn from endless tasks into pieces of a story that might move someone else to care, or to act.

I’ve also drawn strength from the women in my life. Watching them navigate their own struggles has taught me that it’s possible to hit emotional lows and still find a way back. They’ve shown me that persistence doesn’t mean never falling apart; it means learning how to recover, how to rest, and then how to stand up again.

From them, I’ve learned to hold on to hope—not as blind optimism, but as a choice to keep going even when the outcome is uncertain. I’ve also learned to recognize my own efforts. For a long time, I tended to downplay my achievements, to treat them as accidents or as things that weren’t “enough” compared to the scale of the crisis. Now, I’m learning to give myself credit for what I do manage to contribute, however small it might feel.

Climate activism is no longer just the joy of chanting in the streets for me. It’s complicated, emotional, and sometimes painful. But it’s also a space where I can transform fear into creativity, stress into stories, and challenges into opportunities to connect. The work is hard, and the future is uncertain, but the lessons I carry—from my mother, from other women, and from those who persist in the face of difficulty—help me continue with a little more resilience, and a little more hope.
