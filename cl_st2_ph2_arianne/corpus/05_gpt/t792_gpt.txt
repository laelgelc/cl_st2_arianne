Around the world, powerful institutions are driving the destruction of our planet—but they can be resisted by equally powerful acts of courage. These acts are not limited to dramatic moments on the front lines of protests. They also live in everyday decisions: questioning the stories we’re told about consumerism, refusing to accept powerlessness as normal, and choosing to stand together rather than look away.

Greenpeace International’s Executive Directors reflect on how courage has shaped real, tangible victories. People-powered movements have exposed destructive trade deals and confronted systems that treat nature as expendable. Collective pressure has helped protect vital ecosystems and secure marine sanctuaries, creating safe havens for ocean life. Legal challenges have been used to hold destructive actors to account, proving that the law can be a tool for climate justice. Campaigning and public pressure have contributed to phasing out single-use plastics and have pushed the world closer to ending the age of fossil fuels.

They urge us now to fix our gaze firmly on “tomorrow.” That means breaking the grip of overconsumption and the myth that endless growth can exist on a finite planet. It means holding corporations accountable for the damage they cause, instead of letting them profit while communities and ecosystems pay the price. It requires confronting the massive impacts of industrial livestock production, and transforming our food systems so they no longer rely on practices that harm the climate, biodiversity, and human health.

Building a livable future also demands a deep commitment to equality. Inequitable power structures—economic, political, and social—must be shaken and reshaped so that the costs and benefits of our societies are shared more fairly. The struggle for climate justice is inseparable from the struggle for human rights and dignity.

The constant stream of disheartening news can make it easy to feel overwhelmed or numb. But the Executive Directors insist that this is exactly when we must rise, together, through contagious courage. That courage can be expressed in championing renewable energy, supporting sustainable agriculture, and backing leaders and movements that are willing to rebuild our world on fairer, greener foundations.

The message is clear: every act of resistance, every stand for justice, every choice to believe in a better tomorrow contributes to a larger wave of change. By refusing to give in to despair and by taking action—large or small—we help create the positive future that is still within our reach.
