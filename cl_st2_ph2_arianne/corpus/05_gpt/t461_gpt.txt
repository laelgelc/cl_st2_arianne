The corona crisis has exposed deep cracks in the systems that govern our lives. Structures that once seemed immovable are suddenly shifting, revealing just how quickly societies and economies can change when they must. In this moment of disruption, we face a pivotal choice: rebuild the same system that has driven inequality and environmental destruction, or use this turning point to reimagine economies that place human wellbeing and the health of the planet at their core.

After the 2008 financial crash, governments poured vast sums of public money into bailing out polluting industries, locking in more emissions and delaying the shift away from fossil fuels. That response propped up the status quo instead of transforming it. This time, the world cannot afford to repeat that mistake. The planet must be treated as “too big to fail.”

A recovery that truly protects people means one that also reduces our impact on the climate and ecosystems we depend on. Economic stimulus packages can be powerful tools to accelerate a just and green transition—if they are designed with clear priorities. Rather than funnelling resources into the industries most responsible for pollution, public money should support workers, communities, and sectors that build a safer, fairer future.

Investments in green sectors have the potential to create 65 million jobs by 2030 and generate billions in economic gains. This isn’t just about avoiding harm; it’s about actively shaping a more resilient and equitable economy. Supporting renewable energy, ecological farming, and sustainable mobility can simultaneously cut emissions, protect nature, and provide dignified livelihoods.

To ensure this shift, economic recovery packages must follow a simple but powerful principle: do no harm. That means no blank cheques or bailouts for polluters that deepen the climate crisis. Instead, support should be conditional on plans that phase out fossil fuels, transform agriculture towards ecological practices, and build transport systems that are clean, accessible, and sustainable.

The choices made now will reverberate for decades. By prioritizing people and the planet in recovery efforts, governments can help build economies that are more just, more resilient, and aligned with the limits of our shared home.
