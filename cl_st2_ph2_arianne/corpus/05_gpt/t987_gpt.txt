Protected areas have expanded dramatically since 1965, yet biodiversity continues to decline at an alarming rate. This contradiction lies at the heart of a growing critique: the idea that simply drawing lines on a map and declaring land or sea “protected” is not enough to stop species loss.

Mora and Sale describe many of these areas as “paper parks” – protected in name, but not in reality. On the ground and in the water, they are undermined by poor management, inadequate enforcement, and chronic underfunding. Poaching, destructive development, and pollution often continue largely unchecked. Global warming adds yet another layer of pressure, reshaping habitats and species distributions in ways that ignore human-imposed boundaries.

The result is that, even as the global network of protected areas has grown, both terrestrial and marine species have continued to decline. These trends expose a core flaw in treating conservation as a matter of setting aside isolated fragments of nature while allowing business as usual everywhere else.

Ecosystems are dynamic, interconnected systems, not static museum pieces. Species move, migrate, and depend on complex relationships across landscapes and seascapes. Pollution and climate impacts travel through the atmosphere and oceans, crossing borders and protected-area boundaries with ease. Trying to safeguard biodiversity through scattered, poorly managed islands of protection in a sea of escalating human pressure is proving to be tragically inadequate.

The critique goes deeper than management failures inside protected areas. It challenges the assumption that conservation can succeed without confronting the drivers of biodiversity loss in the wider world. Limiting human population growth and reducing consumption are highlighted as essential steps. Without tackling these systemic pressures, protected areas are left to absorb impacts they were never designed to withstand.

Despite decades of environmental effort and the rapid expansion of formal protections, biodiversity continues to plummet. This stark reality signals that conservation strategies must evolve. It calls for embracing the true complexity of nature – recognizing that ecosystems are fluid, boundary-crossing, and deeply entangled with human societies.

Protecting biodiversity will require more than promises on paper. It demands broader, enforced changes that address how we use land and oceans, how much we consume, and how many pressures we place on the living systems that sustain us. Only by aligning conservation with the interconnected, dynamic nature of ecosystems can we hope to slow – and ultimately reverse – the accelerating loss of life on Earth.
