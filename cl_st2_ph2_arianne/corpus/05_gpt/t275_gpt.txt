Every morning on Cousin Island Special Reserve in Seychelles, 25-year-old Athina Antoine heads out to the reef with a clear purpose: help bring a damaged coral ecosystem back to life.

As a member of the Reef Rescuers team with Nature Seychelles, Athina is part of a hands-on effort to restore coral reefs using the “reef gardening” method. Her work begins with collecting small fragments of Pocillopora corals from healthy donor colonies on the reef. These fragments are carefully broken down into even smaller pieces, called nubbins, which can grow into new coral colonies.

Back on the water, Athina and her team attach these nubbins to ropes suspended in midwater nurseries. Hanging in the water column, the ropes give the young corals space and light to grow. For the next 9 to 12 months, Athina’s days are shaped by the rhythms of these nurseries: monitoring coral growth, cleaning away biofouling organisms that could smother the nubbins, and checking that the structures remain secure and healthy.

Once the corals have grown large and strong enough, they are transplanted back onto degraded reef areas. Piece by piece, Athina and her colleagues rebuild sections of reef, using their nursery-grown Pocillopora colonies to create new, living structures where marine life can return and thrive.

This work is urgently needed. Coral bleaching driven by ocean warming, along with pollution, has already taken a heavy toll on reefs in Seychelles. When corals bleach and die, the impacts ripple far beyond the reef itself. In Seychelles, coral reefs support fisheries that many people depend on for food and livelihoods. They are also central to tourism, drawing visitors to the islands’ clear waters and vibrant marine life. Beyond that, reefs provide vital ecosystem services, from coastal protection to supporting biodiversity.

Athina’s role with Reef Rescuers is about more than restoring coral; it is also about restoring hope. She wants her work to show other young people that they can be part of ocean conservation, too. By sharing her experience in the water and in the nurseries, she hopes to inspire more youth in Seychelles and beyond to get involved in protecting and restoring the ocean that sustains them.
