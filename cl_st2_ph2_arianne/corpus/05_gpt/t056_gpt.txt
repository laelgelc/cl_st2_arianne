In the Kyiv suburb of Horenka, a hospital badly damaged by war is now reopening with a very different kind of lifeline: clean, efficient energy.

Greenpeace Central and Eastern Europe, working together with Ukrainian partners Ecoaction, Ecoclub, and Victory of Ukraine, has helped reconstruct the facility by installing a modern renewable energy system instead of rebuilding the old fossil-based one. At the heart of the project is a heat pump connected to 65‑metre‑deep ground probes, paired with a hybrid solar power system on site.

This combination transforms the hospital’s energy use. The new system can cover up to 60% of the building’s energy needs, dramatically reducing its dependence on external supplies. Heating costs are expected to fall by around 80%, a crucial saving for a community under enormous strain. The total investment of €56,000 is projected to pay for itself within six to seven years through lower energy bills.

By cutting CO2 emissions while strengthening resilience, the Horenka hospital shows what it means to apply “Build Back Better” principles in practice. Instead of locking in outdated, polluting technologies during reconstruction, the project demonstrates how war-damaged infrastructure can be rebuilt to be cleaner, safer, and more affordable to run.

This hospital is intended as a model for Ukraine’s broader recovery. Greenpeace CEE and its partners are seeking cooperation with European cities to replicate similar sustainable reconstructions across the country, so that rebuilding from destruction also becomes an opportunity to accelerate a just, renewable energy future.
