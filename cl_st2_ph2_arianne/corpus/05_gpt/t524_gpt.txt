Norway likes to present itself as a country that loves and protects nature – a place of clean fjords, dramatic coastlines and thriving marine life. But behind the polished image lies a very different reality: when it comes to actually safeguarding the oceans, Norway is consistently standing in the way.

On the global stage, Norway has opposed a strong Global Ocean Treaty, a crucial tool that could help create large-scale ocean sanctuaries and protect marine life in international waters. This obstruction is not an isolated incident. In 2016, Norway helped block the creation of protected areas in the Central Arctic Ocean. Last year, it joined Russia and China in blocking new protected areas in the Antarctic. These are some of the most vulnerable and rapidly changing regions on Earth, yet Norway has chosen to side with those delaying real protection.

At home, the priorities are just as troubling. Norway spends more on oil exploration – €6.9 million – than it does on protecting the ocean. Instead of shifting away from fossil fuels, the government is planning new Arctic drilling, pushing industrial activity into one of the most fragile ecosystems on the planet. This is happening despite clear scientific warnings about the impacts of climate change and industrial exploitation on polar and marine environments.

Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg has openly dismissed stronger ocean protection measures on the grounds that they do not create jobs. This reduces the ocean to a resource to be exploited, rather than a living system that underpins climate stability, food security and biodiversity. It also ignores the mounting scientific evidence that healthy oceans are essential for long-term economic and social wellbeing.

The reality in Norwegian waters starkly contradicts the country’s green reputation. Less than 1% of Norway’s coastal areas are protected, far below the 10% protection Norway promised to achieve by 2020. Rather than catching up with its own commitments, Norway is also resisting more ambitious global targets, such as protecting 30% of the world’s oceans through a network of ocean sanctuaries.

Norway cannot claim to be a responsible ocean nation while it blocks protection in the Arctic and Antarctic, spends more on oil exploration than conservation, plans new Arctic drilling, and keeps ocean protection at home at less than 1%. The world needs governments that are willing to put science and the health of the oceans first. Norway has the resources, influence and responsibility to do much better – but right now, it is choosing not to.
