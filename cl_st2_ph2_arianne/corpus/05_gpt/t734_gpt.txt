Around the world, people whose lives and livelihoods are already being disrupted by the climate crisis are turning to the courts to demand climate justice. Their message is clear: governments and institutions must protect people, not pollution.

Lavender farmers in France, beekeepers in Portugal, Romanian shepherds, Kenyan school children, Swedish Sámi youth, and islanders in Germany and Fiji are all part of a growing wave of legal actions. Each of these communities is experiencing the impacts of a warming world in their own way, and each is insisting that those in power uphold their responsibilities.

In Switzerland, the Swiss Senior Women for Climate Protection are taking their government to court. They argue that stronger greenhouse gas emission reductions are urgently needed to protect vulnerable elderly people from the impacts of extreme heat. Their case highlights how the climate crisis is not only an environmental issue, but also a matter of public health and human rights. A court decision on their lawsuit is still pending.

Further north, in Norway, Greenpeace Nordic and the youth organisation Nature and Youth are appealing against licenses for Arctic oil. Their case centres on the right to a healthy environment, challenging the expansion of fossil fuel extraction in one of the most fragile regions on Earth. By contesting these licenses, they are pushing for a future where climate commitments are taken seriously and where human rights are not sacrificed for short-term profit.

At the European level, families from multiple countries are suing the European Union. They argue that the EU’s weak emission reduction targets violate their fundamental rights to life, health, occupation, and property. Their case underlines how inadequate climate policies can directly threaten people’s ability to work, to stay healthy, and to keep their homes and communities safe.

In the Netherlands, the Urgenda case has already set an important precedent by requiring the Dutch government to adopt more ambitious climate action. The case is moving forward with an appeal, keeping pressure on the government to live up to its legal obligations and to act at the speed and scale that science demands.

From Europe to the Pacific, from farmers and shepherds to school children and elders, people are using the law to insist that their rights be protected in the face of the climate emergency. These legal actions are not isolated events; together, they form a powerful call for climate justice and for a safer, fairer future for everyone.
