Around the world, women are bearing the brunt of the climate crisis. As temperatures rise and weather patterns become more extreme, women are often the first to feel the impacts: harsher and more precarious working conditions, heightened health risks, and the trauma of being forced from their homes. These injustices are not abstract. They are intensified every day by fossil fuel projects that drive global heating and poison communities.

The consequences of polluting industries fall heavily on women working outdoors in agriculture, in informal or precarious jobs, and in communities already facing inequality and discrimination. More frequent heatwaves, droughts, floods, and storms put their livelihoods and safety at risk. Health hazards—from air pollution to contaminated water and extreme heat—hit hardest where access to healthcare is already limited. When climate disasters force people to move, women and girls are often more exposed to violence, exploitation, and the loss of education and income.

This reality makes opposition to coal, oil, and gas not just a scientific or economic necessity, but a moral imperative. Every new fossil fuel project locks in more catastrophic weather, more health emergencies, and more displacement. Standing against these polluting industries is about defending basic human rights and dignity, especially for those who are most affected and least responsible.

Across the globe, women in Greenpeace and allied movements are taking that stand every day. Libby, Irene Wabiwa, Dana, Zanna, Edina Ifticene, Anita Cosgrove, and Anusha Narayanan are among those leading campaigns that confront the fossil fuel industry head-on. From the forests and communities of the Congo to the contested waters of the Eastern Mediterranean, from the fracking and drilling of the Permian Basin to the massive gas expansion at Australia’s Burrup Hub, they are challenging powerful interests that profit from pollution and climate breakdown.

These women are organizing communities, exposing corporate and government negligence, and demanding a rapid shift away from oil, gas, and coal. Their work shows that climate justice and gender justice are deeply connected: when women lead in resisting fossil fuel expansion, they are also fighting for safer workplaces, cleaner air and water, and the right to stay in their homes and on their lands.

This leadership does not stand alone. It is part of a broader legacy of women who have shaped and continue to shape the environmental movement. Vandana Shiva has long highlighted how ecological destruction and social injustice go hand in hand. Greta Thunberg has galvanized a global youth movement that refuses to accept a future defined by climate chaos. Wangari Maathai showed how grassroots action, especially by women, can restore ecosystems and strengthen communities at the same time.

Women on the frontlines of the climate crisis are not just its victims—they are powerful agents of change. By confronting fossil fuel projects in places like the Congo, the Eastern Mediterranean, the Permian Basin, and the Burrup Hub, and by building on the legacy of leaders like Vandana Shiva, Greta Thunberg, and Wangari Maathai, they are charting a path toward a safer, fairer world. Standing with them means rejecting the expansion of polluting industries and insisting on a future where no one’s health, work, or home is sacrificed to the fossil fuel economy.
