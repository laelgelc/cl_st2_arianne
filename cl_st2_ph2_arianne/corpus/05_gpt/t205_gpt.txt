In just a few days, the world will receive another stark reminder of what the climate crisis means for people and the planet. On February 28, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) will release the second part of its Sixth Assessment Report – the most comprehensive global assessment of climate science since 2014.

This new installment builds on last August’s warning, described as a “Code Red for Humanity,” which laid out in clear terms how human activity is driving unprecedented changes to our climate system. Now the focus shifts from causes to consequences: how the climate crisis is already affecting humanity and ecosystems, and what it means for our shared future.

The report will examine climate impacts on communities and natural systems, highlighting who and what is most vulnerable, and where resilience is being tested or shattered. It will look closely at coastal communities on the frontlines of sea-level rise and extreme weather, and at how societies can build resilience in the face of changes that are now unavoidable, including further warming and rising seas.

A crucial part of this assessment is social justice. The report will address how climate-resilient development must reckon with inequality: who is most exposed, who has the least resources to cope, and how decisions about adaptation and protection can either deepen injustices or help correct them. It will explore adaptation solutions that can protect people and ecosystems as conditions continue to change.

This is only one piece of the IPCC’s Sixth Assessment. A third part, due in April, will focus on what must be done to cut greenhouse gas emissions, and how quickly. Then, in October, a synthesis report will bring together the findings from all three parts into a single, integrated picture of the climate crisis, its impacts, and the options still open to us.

These reports arrive at a critical moment. Since the last full assessment in 2014, the climate has continued to warm, with several of the hottest years on record occurring in that period. The worsening conditions on the ground make it impossible to ignore what scientists have been saying for decades: we are running out of time to avoid the most dangerous outcomes, and every fraction of a degree matters.

The findings of this new report will be central to political discussions at COP27 and beyond. Governments will not be able to claim ignorance of the risks, the vulnerabilities, or the choices before them. Scientists are sounding the alarm with increasing urgency; it is up to decision-makers to listen, and to act at the scale and speed that the evidence demands.
