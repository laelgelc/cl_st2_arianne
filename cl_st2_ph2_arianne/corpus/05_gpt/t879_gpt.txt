My phone wakes me up each morning, guides me through unfamiliar cities, holds my calendar, keeps me in touch with family and friends, and lets me work from almost anywhere. It’s hard to imagine my daily life without it. In many ways, I see technology as a powerful force for good—connecting people, spreading information, and solving problems that once felt impossible.

But there’s a side of our digital lives we rarely stop to think about. We’ve slipped into treating our electronics as if they were disposable. Phones, laptops, and tablets are often designed and marketed to be replaced every couple of years. When a battery wears out, a screen cracks, or a device starts to feel slow, the default response is usually to buy something new.

This disposable mindset has real consequences. Electronic waste is already a massive and growing problem. In 2012, the world generated 48.9 million tonnes of e-waste. That number is expected to reach 65.4 million tonnes by next year. Every device that ends up in a drawer, a landfill, or a shredder represents not just waste, but the loss of all the resources and energy that went into making it.

Manufacturing our gadgets is incredibly resource-intensive. A typical device can contain around 40 different elements, many of which are mined and processed at significant environmental cost. On top of that, producing electronics requires vast amounts of water. By the time a new phone or laptop reaches our hands, it has already left a large footprint on the planet.

As the CEO of iFixit, I believe we can change this story. Instead of accepting short lifespans as normal, we can choose to repair and maintain the technology we already own. Every time we fix a device instead of replacing it, we keep it in use longer and delay the need for a new one to be manufactured.

That’s why we focus on empowering people to repair. We publish free repair tutorials so that anyone, anywhere, can learn how to open up their gadgets, replace worn-out parts, and bring old devices back to life. People are fixing old phones instead of tossing them, upgrading their computers to extend their usefulness, and choosing products that are designed to be repairable in the first place.

These actions might seem small at the individual level, but together they add up. Repairing what we already have reduces waste, conserves resources, and gives us more control over the technology that plays such a central role in our lives. By embracing repair and demanding products that last, we can keep enjoying the benefits of our digital world without treating our gadgets—and the planet—as disposable.
