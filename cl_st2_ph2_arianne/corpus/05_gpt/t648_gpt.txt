As a new year begins, it’s a powerful moment to rethink what resolutions really matter—for our own wellbeing and for the planet we share. Beyond the usual goals of exercising more or saving money, we can choose commitments that help create cleaner air, healthier communities, and a safer climate.

One of the most impactful resolutions is to demand that our governments redesign our cities around people, not cars. That means pushing for more and safer bike lanes, reliable and affordable public transportation, and policies that phase out fossil fuel cars in favour of cleaner alternatives. When cities are built for walking, cycling, and transit, everyone benefits: less air pollution, less traffic, and more vibrant, liveable streets. A resolution can be as simple as pledging to contact local representatives, support campaigns for sustainable urban planning, or join community groups advocating for better transport options.

Alongside calling for systemic change, we can also choose everyday actions that make a real difference. Opting to bike, walk, or use public transport instead of driving doesn’t just cut climate‑warming emissions—it also improves our own health. Swapping some car journeys for active travel can build exercise into daily routines, reduce stress, and help reclaim our streets as public spaces rather than traffic corridors. Even small shifts, like choosing the bus a few times a week or cycling short distances, add up over time.

Another powerful resolution is to get more involved in climate activism. Volunteering with Greenpeace offers ways to turn concern into collective action, whether that’s joining marches, supporting peaceful direct actions, or helping organize local events. From taking to the streets to occupying oil rigs, people-powered movements have always been at the heart of environmental progress. Committing a few hours a month to activism can amplify your voice and connect you with others who share your determination to protect the planet.

What we eat is also deeply connected to the climate crisis. Reducing meat and dairy consumption is a concrete step individuals can take to cut greenhouse gas emissions. Shifting towards a more plant-based diet can lower our environmental footprint while also supporting better health. A resolution might be to try plant-based meals a few times a week, explore new recipes, or choose plant-based options when eating out. These choices, multiplied across millions of people, can help transform our food systems.

Plastic pollution is another urgent challenge that New Year’s resolutions can address. Rejecting single-use plastics—such as disposable bottles, cups, bags, and packaging—is a direct way to cut waste and protect oceans, rivers, and wildlife. Carrying reusable bags, bottles, and containers, and choosing products with minimal or refillable packaging, are simple habits that quickly become second nature. But personal choices alone are not enough. We can also use our voices to demand that major corporations like Coca-Cola and Nestlé move away from single-use plastics and adopt truly sustainable packaging solutions.

Each of these resolutions—pressuring governments to build cleaner, fairer cities; choosing low-carbon transport; volunteering in climate campaigns; embracing more plant-based foods; and rejecting single-use plastics while pushing companies to change—connects personal action with systemic transformation. This year, our goals can be about more than self-improvement. They can be about reshaping the world we live in, so that clean air, a stable climate, and a healthy environment are part of everyone’s future.
