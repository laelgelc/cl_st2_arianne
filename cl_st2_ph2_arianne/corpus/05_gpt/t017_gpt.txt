On a quiet street in Quezon City in April 2021, as COVID-19 lockdowns deepened hunger and unemployment across the Philippines, a simple cart appeared.

It was filled with rice, vegetables, canned goods, and other essentials. A handwritten principle guided it: “Give what you can, take what you need.” This was the Maginhawa community pantry, started by Patricia Non at a time when many people, including jeepney drivers and informal workers, had lost their livelihoods and were struggling to eat.

What began as one cart quickly became a nationwide movement. The idea was simple but powerful: neighbors helping neighbors, without conditions, paperwork, or bureaucracy. People who had a little extra shared what they could. People who had nothing took what they needed to get through the day.

Within weeks, the Maginhawa model spread across the country. More than 6,700 community pantries emerged in cities, towns, and villages, feeding thousands of people. Long lines formed as families, workers, and the elderly queued for basic food. Jeepney drivers, whose routes had been suspended or reduced during lockdowns, were among those who relied on these pantries to survive.

The pantries did more than fill empty stomachs. They built new connections between rural and urban communities. Small farmers like Rosalina Tagle, who often risked seeing their crops go to waste when they couldn’t reach markets, found a way to bring their produce directly to people in the city. Instead of vegetables being left to rot in the fields, they were shared through pantries, ensuring both nourishment for communities and dignity for farmers.

From this experience grew the BuyAnihan system, an evolution of the community pantry model. BuyAnihan emphasized food sovereignty, local sourcing, and stronger support for farmers. It aimed to ensure that food systems worked not only in times of crisis, but in ways that respected the rights and needs of those who grow food. By prioritizing local produce and direct connections, BuyAnihan helped strengthen community control over food and reduce waste.

The movement did not grow without obstacles. Organizers and volunteers faced red-tagging, a dangerous practice that put them at risk simply for engaging in mutual aid. Despite this, the spirit of solidarity persisted. The pantries and the BuyAnihan system became symbols of resilience—ordinary people stepping up where formal systems fell short.

At its heart, the community pantry movement is about mutual aid and shared responsibility. It shows how communities can come together to address hunger, support small farmers, and build more sustainable and just ways of accessing food. It also underscores a clear demand: that government institutions must act to ensure sustainable, reliable food access for all, so that no one has to rely on emergency measures just to eat.

From one small cart on Maginhawa Street, a nationwide call for dignity, food sovereignty, and collective care continues to echo.
