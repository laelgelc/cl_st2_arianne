The holidays are supposed to be a season of joy, but the reality behind the gifts we exchange is often anything but cheerful—especially when it comes wrapped in single-use plastic. From toy packaging to decorative trimmings, plastic that’s used for a few seconds or minutes lingers in our environment for decades or longer.

Only 9% of all plastic ever produced has been recycled. The rest is burned, buried, or left to pollute our lands and waters. Every single minute, the equivalent of a truckload of plastic enters our oceans. There, it breaks down into smaller and smaller pieces, harming marine life that mistake it for food and ultimately making its way into our food chains.

This isn’t just an unfortunate byproduct of modern life; it’s the result of a system built on throwaway culture. Corporations have aggressively promoted convenience and mass consumption, flooding the market with disposable packaging and products. At the same time, they’ve pushed the narrative that the real solution lies with individual consumers—telling us to recycle more, or feel guilty when we can’t—while continuing to churn out more single-use plastic than ever.

In 2018, people pushed back. Consumer pressure forced major companies like Kroger, McDonald’s, and Starbucks to respond. They began to reduce some of their plastic use, starting with high-profile items like plastic straws. Those moves showed that public demand can drive change—but they were only a first step. Straws are just a tiny fraction of the problem, and the vast majority of plastic packaging remains untouched.

The scale of the crisis demands much more than symbolic gestures. Single-use plastics are not only an environmental disaster; they also pose serious health and justice concerns. Communities living near plastic production and waste facilities bear disproportionate burdens from pollution and toxic exposure, while people worldwide are exposed to plastics and their additives through food, water, and air.

That’s why our resolutions cannot stop at using one less straw or one more reusable bag. The coming year must be about fundamentally changing our relationship with plastic. On a personal level, that means doing everything we can to eliminate our own use of throwaway plastics—saying no to unnecessary packaging, choosing reusables, and rethinking what we buy in the first place.

But it also means demanding far more from those with the power to transform the system. Corporate leaders must phase out single-use plastics entirely, redesigning products and packaging so that reuse, refill, and truly sustainable alternatives become the norm, not the exception. Political leaders must back this shift with strong policies that curb plastic production, restrict harmful products, and hold corporations accountable for the waste they create.

The plastic pollution crisis is not inevitable. It’s the result of choices—by companies, by policymakers, and by all of us. In the wake of another holiday season filled with plastic packaging that will outlive the gifts it contained, it’s time to choose a different path: one that protects our oceans, our health, and our communities by ending the age of throwaway plastics once and for all.
