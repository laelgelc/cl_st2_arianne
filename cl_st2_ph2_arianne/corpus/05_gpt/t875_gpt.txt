When US President Obama announced what will be the world’s largest ocean sanctuary, it sent a powerful signal: protecting our oceans at scale is both possible and urgently needed. At the same time, governments are gathering at the United Nations to negotiate a new treaty for the high seas – the vast areas of ocean beyond national borders where life is rich, but protection is desperately poor.

Right now, less than 1% of the high seas is protected. Scientists are clear that this is nowhere near enough. They recommend that at least 30% of the world’s oceans be placed under protection to help marine life recover, rebuild fish stocks, and strengthen our fight against climate change. Ocean sanctuaries are one of the most effective tools we have to achieve this.

Governments have already promised to protect at least 10% of the oceans by 2020, but most are far behind their commitments. The new UN treaty talks are a critical chance to close this gap and put us on a path to the 30% target scientists say is needed. Without strong rules and clear mechanisms to create and enforce sanctuaries on the high seas, these commitments risk remaining empty words.

The benefits of properly protected sanctuaries are profound. When areas of ocean are fully protected, marine life can rebound dramatically. Biomass and biodiversity can increase up to fourfold, turning depleted waters into thriving refuges for species of all kinds. These gains don’t just stay inside sanctuary boundaries; they spill over into surrounding areas, helping to rebuild fish stocks and support more sustainable fisheries.

Healthy oceans also make economic sense. Strong sanctuary protection can boost local and national economies through tourism and more resilient fisheries. As marine life recovers and ecosystems stabilize, communities that depend on the ocean for their livelihoods stand to benefit.

Crucially, ocean sanctuaries are also a frontline defense against climate change. Oceans absorb and store vast amounts of carbon, and healthy, intact marine ecosystems are better at locking that carbon away. By protecting key areas, we help safeguard this natural climate regulation system, making our planet more resilient to the impacts of a warming world.

Greenpeace is pushing hard for strong, enforceable sanctuary rules in the UN high seas treaty. This means clear processes for creating large-scale protected areas, robust safeguards against destructive activities, and a framework that can deliver protection at the scale scientists are calling for.

President Obama’s announcement is a major step forward, but it is only one part of the global effort needed. The UN negotiations must deliver a robust deal that can turn political promises into real protection in the water. With less than 1% of the high seas currently protected and so much at stake for biodiversity, economies, and the climate, there is no time to lose.
