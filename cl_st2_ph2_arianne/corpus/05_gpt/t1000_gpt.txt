Bob Hunter’s life traced a path from rebellious journalist to pioneering environmental activist, leaving a legacy that continues to shape Greenpeace and the wider climate and environmental movement.

Born in 1941 in Winnipeg, Bob Hunter built a reputation as a nonconformist writer, eventually becoming a columnist for the Vancouver Sun. His work there reflected a sharp, questioning mind and a willingness to challenge the status quo. That same rebellious streak led him to make a defining choice in 1971: he quit his column to join a small group of activists sailing toward Amchitka Island in Alaska, determined to confront a planned U.S. nuclear weapons test.

That 1971 voyage not only helped galvanize public opposition to nuclear testing; it also gave rise to a name and idea that would echo around the world. During this campaign, Hunter coined the term “Greenpeace,” capturing in one word the fusion of ecological protection and non-violent action. What began as a single voyage became the spark for a global environmental organization and a new kind of activism.

From 1973 to 1977, Hunter served as president of Greenpeace. In that role, he helped define the group’s character and strategy, developing what he called “media mindbombs” — vivid, dramatic actions designed to sear environmental issues into the public imagination. He understood that to change policy, you first had to change what people could see and feel.

Under his leadership, Greenpeace volunteers carried out actions that became iconic. They confronted whaling ships at sea, placing small boats between harpoons and whales to create powerful images of courage and vulnerability. They also experimented with tactics like dyeing whitecoat seal pups to make their fur commercially worthless, challenging the brutal seal hunt while drawing intense media attention. These actions were carefully crafted to reach far beyond the immediate scene, using the power of images and storytelling to shift global opinion.

Hunter’s influence extended beyond direct action. He became a familiar face and voice in the media, hosting television shows and using broadcast platforms to bring environmental issues into people’s homes. As an author, he wrote books including “Warriors of the Rainbow,” where he helped articulate the spirit and stories that animated early Greenpeace campaigns.

A central inspiration for Hunter was a Cree myth of the “rainbow warriors” — a prophecy describing people who would rise to defend the Earth when it was in peril. He wove this story into the identity of Greenpeace and the broader environmental movement, offering a narrative of responsibility, courage, and hope. For Hunter, activism was not only about protest; it was about embodying a hopeful vision of what humanity could be.

Despite the seriousness of the crises he confronted, Hunter was known for his humor and optimism. He brought wit, irreverence, and a sense of possibility to his work, helping others believe that ordinary people could stand up to powerful interests and make a difference. That blend of creativity, courage, and optimism became a hallmark of Greenpeace’s early years and continues to influence its campaigns.

Bob Hunter died of cancer on May 2, 2005. He was 63. His death marked the loss of one of Greenpeace’s founders and most original thinkers, but the ideas and tactics he championed live on wherever people use bold, non-violent action and powerful storytelling to defend the planet.
