The future of transport that dominates our screens is sleek, shiny – and deeply unsustainable. Hollywood blockbusters and glossy car ads keep selling the same basic fantasy: every person in their own private vehicle, gliding effortlessly through empty streets or flying above them. But beneath the CGI and chrome is a vision that locks us into high energy use, soaring emissions, and cities built around machines instead of people.

There is another story we can tell – one that already exists in many places, and that points toward a fairer, cleaner future.

Efficient public transport systems show what’s possible when we design mobility for people, not for cars. Trains, buses, and trams move far more people using far less energy and space than private vehicles ever could. They don’t just cut climate pollution; they act as a social safety net, giving everyone – regardless of income, age, or ability to drive – a reliable way to get to work, school, healthcare, and community life.

Cities around the world are proving that this works in practice. Moscow’s extensive metro network, Beijing’s vast web of rail and buses, and Auckland’s growing public transport system demonstrate how coordinated, frequent services can reshape daily life. When public transport is fast, affordable, and dependable, it becomes the obvious choice – not a last resort.

To make room for this kind of future, we need to confront how much of our cities has been surrendered to cars. Los Angeles is a stark example: huge swathes of valuable urban land are given over to parking lots, multi-storey garages, and wide roads. This is space that could instead be used for homes, parks, schools, and community spaces. Reducing the number of cars doesn’t just cut emissions; it frees up entire landscapes for people to live better lives.

Clean air is one of the most immediate benefits of moving away from private car dependence. Fewer cars mean fewer exhaust fumes and less particulate pollution, which translates into healthier lungs and hearts, especially for children and older people. Streets designed for walking, cycling, and public transport become quieter, safer, and more welcoming.

There will still be times when vehicles are needed – for people with limited mobility, for emergency services, for certain kinds of work and travel. Shared electric vehicles can cover many of these essential needs without locking society into one-car-per-person. When combined with strong public transport, walking, and cycling infrastructure, shared EVs become a complement rather than a new way to prolong car dominance.

Some cities are already showing how to rebalance streets in favour of people. London has expanded cycling routes and low-traffic neighbourhoods, encouraging more journeys on foot and by bike. Copenhagen has long prioritised cycling, with networks of bike lanes that make it normal and safe for people of all ages to travel on two wheels. These choices don’t happen by accident – they come from deliberate decisions to put health, climate, and community ahead of car convenience.

Resistance to the car industry’s role in the climate crisis is growing. In Frankfurt, people have taken to the streets to protest an industry that continues to push bigger, heavier vehicles and car-centric lifestyles despite the mounting damage to the climate and our cities. Their message is clear: the status quo is not acceptable, and the future must not be written in exhaust fumes and traffic jams.

Challenging the car-centred vision that dominates our culture means demanding better from both policymakers and industry. It means supporting investments in clean, efficient public transport; backing measures that reclaim parking and road space for people; and insisting that walking and cycling be safe, attractive options for everyone.

An open letter is calling for exactly this kind of change – a shift away from the narrow, car-dominated story of mobility and toward transport systems that protect the climate, clean up our air, and put people first. Adding your voice is a concrete way to push back against the fantasy future sold by Hollywood and the car industry, and to help build a real future where our streets belong to the many, not the machines.
