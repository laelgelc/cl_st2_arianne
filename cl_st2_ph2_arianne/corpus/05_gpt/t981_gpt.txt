Greenpeace Italy welcomes the Benetton Group’s decision to eliminate all hazardous chemical releases from its global supply chain and products by 2020. This commitment follows similar pledges from brands including Zara, Mango, Esprit, and Levi’s, and comes after strong pressure from activists and consumers demanding cleaner, safer fashion.

With Benetton joining, 13 major clothing brands have now committed to detox their production, sending a clear signal that the fashion industry can no longer ignore its role in toxic pollution. While these companies move forward, competitors such as Calvin Klein, GAP, and G-Star Raw risk being left behind and appearing out of touch with growing public concern and expectations.

The call now is for more fashion houses to follow suit and commit to eliminating hazardous chemicals from their supply chains and products. People are encouraged to share the “Detox Fashion” video to increase pressure on brands that have not yet acted, such as Victoria’s Secret, and to push them to adopt non-hazardous alternatives and help end fashion-related pollution.
