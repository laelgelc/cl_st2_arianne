COVID-19 has shown how deeply human health is connected to the way we treat animals and the environment. As a zoonotic disease, like SARS and avian flu, it emerged from the complex relationships between people, animals and ecosystems. These diseases are not random accidents; they are warning signals from a planet under pressure.

Industrial animal farming plays a significant role in increasing the risk of outbreaks. When animals are kept in cramped, stressful conditions, disease can spread quickly and mutate more easily. High numbers of animals packed together, often with limited genetic diversity, create ideal conditions for viruses to thrive. This system is designed for maximum production, not for resilience or safety, and it leaves both animals and people more vulnerable to new and dangerous diseases.

At the same time, environmental degradation is weakening the natural barriers that help protect us from pandemics. Deforestation, pollution and the destruction of habitats disrupt ecosystems that would otherwise act as buffers. When forests are cleared and wild areas are fragmented, people and domesticated animals come into closer contact with wildlife, increasing the chances that new diseases will jump between species.

Intact ecosystems are powerful allies in preventing and mitigating health crises. Healthy forests filter air, store carbon and regulate local climates. They support biodiversity, including species and ecological processes that help keep disease in check. Oceans, too, play a vital role in stabilizing the climate, producing much of the oxygen we breathe and supporting complex food webs. These natural systems are also a source of medical knowledge and potential treatments, offering insights that can lead to new medicines and therapies.

As societies look toward recovery from COVID-19, the choices made now will shape our future vulnerability to pandemics and climate breakdown. Public money should not be used to bail out industries that drive environmental destruction and increase health risks. Propping up polluting sectors or expanding industrial animal agriculture only deepens the underlying problems that contributed to the crisis in the first place.

Instead, recovery efforts can support green jobs and sustainable food systems that protect both people and the planet. Investing in renewable energy, ecological farming and resilient local economies can reduce emissions, improve public health and create more secure livelihoods. Shifting towards food systems that prioritize animal welfare, biodiversity and reduced pollution lowers the risk of future disease outbreaks while providing healthier diets.

Banning the wildlife trade is another essential step. The capture, transport and sale of wild animals bring different species into unnatural contact, often in stressful and unhygienic conditions. This creates opportunities for pathogens to spread and evolve. Ending this trade reduces the risk of new zoonotic diseases emerging and protects threatened species at the same time.

Ultimately, the pandemic underscores that human health and planetary health are inseparable. Protecting forests and oceans, transforming industrial agriculture, ending destructive practices and building sustainable economies are not optional extras; they are central to preventing future crises. By choosing recovery paths that put people and the planet first, and by acting together across communities and borders, it is possible to build a safer, healthier and more just world for everyone.
