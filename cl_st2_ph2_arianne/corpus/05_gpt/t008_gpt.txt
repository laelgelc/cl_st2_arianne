A recent report from the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has sparked serious concern among public health and climate advocates. The report claims that meat, eggs, and milk provide essential nutrients that are difficult to obtain from plant-based foods, and that these animal-based products are therefore vital for health, particularly for vulnerable groups. Yet this framing stands in stark contrast to a growing body of evidence indicating that well-planned plant-based diets can meet nutritional needs across all life stages.

The FAO’s emphasis on animal products echoes long-standing messaging from the meat and dairy industry, which has consistently sought to position its products as indispensable for human health. This overlap is not coincidental. The report was influenced by livestock organizations, including the Global Dairy Platform and signatories of the pro-meat Dublin Declaration. These ties raise serious questions about the objectivity and independence of a document that will likely be used to guide nutrition and agricultural policy around the world.

This is especially troubling given the conclusions of major scientific efforts such as the EAT-Lancet Commission, as well as positions from nutrition bodies that recognize well-planned plant-based diets as nutritionally adequate. These sources highlight that plant-based diets can support good health, and that shifting away from high levels of animal product consumption is crucial for both human and planetary wellbeing. By downplaying this evidence and foregrounding the supposed irreplaceability of meat, eggs, and milk, the FAO report risks reinforcing outdated dietary patterns that are at odds with climate and health goals.

The dynamics surrounding this report mirror a familiar pattern from another powerful sector: fossil fuels. For decades, fossil fuel companies have funded research, public relations campaigns, and lobbying efforts to minimize public understanding of the climate impacts of coal, oil, and gas, and to slow the transition to cleaner alternatives. The meat and dairy industries now appear to be deploying similar tactics—shaping scientific narratives, influencing international institutions, and promoting the idea that their products are essential and irreplaceable, despite mounting evidence of their environmental and health harms.

By aligning so closely with livestock industry messaging, the FAO risks undermining its own credibility at a time when the world urgently needs clear, science-based guidance on food system transformation. Public institutions must be transparent about industry influence and must prioritize independent, peer-reviewed evidence that fully accounts for both health and climate impacts. Anything less plays into the hands of powerful interests whose business models depend on maintaining high levels of animal product consumption.

The controversy around this report is a reminder that the struggle over the future of food is not just about recipes or personal preference. It is about whose voices shape global policy, whose science is elevated or sidelined, and whether we learn from the playbook of the fossil fuel industry—or repeat its mistakes in the realm of food and agriculture.
