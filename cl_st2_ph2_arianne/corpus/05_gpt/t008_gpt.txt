The UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has released a report claiming that meat, eggs, and milk provide “essential” nutrients that are difficult to obtain from plant-based foods, and are therefore vital for health – especially for children, adolescents, pregnant and breastfeeding people, and older adults. At a time when the climate and biodiversity crises demand urgent dietary shifts away from industrial animal agriculture, this framing is deeply troubling.

The report’s core message mirrors long-standing meat and dairy industry narratives: that animal products are nutritionally unique and irreplaceable, and that cutting back on them is a threat to public health. Yet this sits uneasily alongside a growing body of research and guidance from independent nutrition and health authorities. The EAT-Lancet Commission, for example, has concluded that well-planned plant-based and plant-forward diets can meet nutritional needs while significantly reducing environmental impacts. Major nutrition bodies have also affirmed that appropriately planned vegetarian and vegan diets are nutritionally adequate for all life stages.

The FAO document does not exist in a vacuum. It was reviewed by powerful livestock industry groups, including the Global Dairy Platform and the International Meat Secretariat. Several of its authors are also linked to the Dublin Declaration – a statement promoted by pro-meat academics and industry-aligned voices that defends the continued expansion of livestock production. These connections raise serious questions about the report’s objectivity and about whose interests it ultimately serves.

When organizations tasked with safeguarding public interest allow industry influence to shape their messaging, the result is predictable: the environmental and health harms of high meat and dairy consumption are minimised, while the supposed irreplaceability of animal-source foods is amplified. The tactics are strikingly familiar. Just as fossil fuel companies have spent decades funding research, shaping narratives, and lobbying to downplay their role in driving the climate crisis, parts of the livestock sector now appear to be working to preserve business as usual by framing animal products as nutritionally indispensable.

This is not a neutral scientific debate. It is a struggle over the story we tell about what a healthy, sustainable diet looks like in a heating world. Elevating a narrative that meat, eggs, and milk are uniquely essential – while sidelining evidence that plant-based diets can fully meet human nutritional needs when properly planned – risks locking in high-emissions food systems at precisely the moment we need to transform them.

Public institutions like the FAO have a responsibility to ensure that their guidance is free from undue corporate influence and reflects the full weight of independent science. That means being transparent about conflicts of interest, critically examining industry involvement in report drafting and review, and giving equal space to the robust evidence supporting plant-based nutrition.

The world cannot afford a repeat of the fossil fuel playbook in our food systems. As the climate crisis accelerates, we need clear, unbiased guidance that supports a rapid shift towards diets that are good for people and the planet – not narratives that protect the profits of the meat and dairy industry.
