In the coastal district of Chana in southern Thailand, 18-year-old Khairiyah Rahmanyah stands at the center of a struggle over the future of her community’s land and sea.

Khairiyah is the daughter of a fisherman and grew up closely connected to the marine environment that sustains local livelihoods. Her father’s involvement in the Thai Sea Watch Association exposed her early on to the impacts that large-scale industrial projects can have on coastal ecosystems and fishing communities. That experience shaped her understanding of what is at stake for Chana.

The proposed project she is now opposing would turn 26.8 square kilometers of seaside into an industrial zone for heavy industries. For local people, this isn’t an abstract development plan. It would transform areas they depend on for fishing and other marine resources, with consequences for both the environment and the social fabric of the community.

Khairiyah has become a leading voice in the protests against this project. Alongside other residents, she has helped build the Save Chana movement, which organizes demonstrations and challenges the project’s approval process. Their persistent actions have delayed public hearings, buying crucial time for local concerns to be heard and for scrutiny of the project to continue.

Her activism has come at a personal cost. Khairiyah has faced police intimidation, arrests, and ongoing surveillance because of her role in the movement. Despite this pressure, she continues to speak out, using tools like Facebook Live to share protests and updates directly with a wider audience. Social media has become one of her main ways to ensure that what happens in Chana is visible beyond her district.

Khairiyah draws inspiration from young climate activists like Greta Thunberg, seeing herself as part of a broader generation standing up for environmental protection and community rights. For her, defending Chana’s coast is not only about resisting a single industrial project but about safeguarding a way of life and a relationship with the sea that has defined her community for generations.

Looking ahead, she dreams of studying psychology so she can bring those skills back to her hometown. Even as she navigates the risks of frontline activism, her vision for the future remains rooted in supporting and strengthening the people of Chana.
