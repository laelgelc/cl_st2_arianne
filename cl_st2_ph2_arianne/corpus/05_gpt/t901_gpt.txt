When Mike Fincken sat down to help judge the #SaveTheArctic poster competition, he wasn’t in a quiet gallery or a formal jury room. As captain of Greenpeace’s Arctic Sunrise, he was reviewing more than 2000 entries from 75 countries with the Arctic itself never far from his thoughts. The result of that global outpouring of creativity: three young artists – Anastasia (21, Russia), Sara (18, Spain), and Emile (20, Canada) – will join him on a voyage to the Arctic.

Their posters rose to the top of an extraordinary collection of work that turned concern for the Arctic into powerful images. As Mike sifted through the entries, he shared some of his favourites on Twitter. Among them were a poster titled “Bear Walks into a Bar,” a surreal scene of giraffes towering above rising seas, a shocking image of a fist throttling a polar bear, and a reimagining of Life of Pi featuring Arctic animals. Each one used familiar symbols and stories in unexpected ways to demand attention for a region under threat.

For Mike, these weren’t just posters; they were “artivism” in action – art used as a tool to fight injustice. The competition showed how a paintbrush, a pen, or a tablet can become a megaphone for the Arctic, carrying messages across borders and languages. It also highlighted how people everywhere, especially young people, are ready to stand up for a fragile, vital part of our planet.

As the three winners prepare to travel north aboard the Arctic Sunrise, their journey is part of a much larger movement. Mike is clear that the images can’t just stay on the page or the wall. He’s calling on all of us to use social media to amplify these messages, share the posters, and keep pushing the call to #SaveTheArctic into feeds, timelines, and conversations around the world.

Every share, retweet, and post helps these acts of “artivism” reach further. The Arctic may feel distant, but through this global wave of creativity and online action, its future is being pulled closer to the centre of public attention – where it needs to be.
