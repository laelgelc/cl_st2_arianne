At the Rebuild Indonesia Youth Festival, around 200 young people gathered to do something simple but powerful: imagine a different future for Indonesia.

In the “Dare to Dream” activity, Greenpeace invited participants to picture an Indonesia free from oligarchy, injustice, and environmental crises. Instead of starting from fear or despair, the space was designed around hope, creativity, and the belief that another world is possible.

Using the AI tool MidJourney, participants turned their visions into images. They typed in the futures they wanted to see using words like “clean cities,” “no pollution,” “green spaces,” “safe streets,” and “community.” Each set of keywords produced a different visual outcome, showing how many ways a just and sustainable Indonesia can be imagined. Artists were on hand to help refine and develop these images, supporting participants to better express what they had in mind.

The result was a diverse collection of visual futures: cities reimagined, streets reclaimed, and communities centered in their own stories. These images were not just artworks, but conversation starters. They opened up discussions about what it would mean to move beyond models of infinite economic growth, to tax oligarchs, and to cancel GDP as the main measure of progress.

Rather than treating young people as passive observers of the climate and social crises, the activity placed them at the center as co-creators of solutions. By daring to dream, they explored how Indonesia could be rebuilt on foundations of justice, care, and ecological balance.

The “Dare to Dream” experience showed that imagination is a crucial tool for change. When young people are given the space and tools to visualize a different future, it becomes easier to talk about bold alternatives and to see themselves as part of building a sustainable world.
