Indonesia’s textile industry, worth around US$20 billion and supplying many global fashion brands, has left a heavy environmental footprint. For decades, rivers such as the Citarum have been used as dumping grounds for industrial wastewater. Since the 1990s, this pollution has helped render surrounding rice fields unproductive, undermining the livelihoods of local farming communities and damaging one of the country’s staple food sources.

Between 2004 and 2015 alone, the economic losses linked to this environmental damage reached IDR 11.4 trillion (about US$838 million). These figures reflect not just degraded land and poisoned waterways, but also the broader social and economic costs borne by communities who depend on clean rivers and fertile soil.

In May 2016, a significant legal breakthrough offered a measure of hope. A court ruling suspended government decrees that had effectively legalized wastewater discharges from three textile companies: PT. Kahatex, PT. Insan Sandang Internusa, and PT. Five Star Textile. The court found that these discharge permits had been issued without proper environmental studies or adequate monitoring. By invoking the precautionary principle, the ruling underscored that when there is a risk of serious or irreversible environmental harm, the absence of full scientific certainty cannot be used as a reason to delay protective measures.

This decision is a crucial reminder that the law can serve as a tool to defend rivers, fields, and communities from industrial pollution. It also sends a signal to both companies and regulators that shortcuts on environmental safeguards are unacceptable, especially when entire ecosystems and local economies are at stake.

For communities along rivers like the Citarum, the ruling offers a glimpse of what a cleaner, healthier future might look like if pollution is controlled and prevention is prioritized. But legal victories alone are not enough. The global fashion brands that source from Indonesia’s textile sector have a direct responsibility to ensure that their supply chains do not poison waterways or destroy farmland.

Greenpeace is calling on these brands to fully deliver on their Detox commitments. That means eliminating hazardous chemicals from their supply chains, investing in clean production, and ensuring transparency and accountability from factory to finished product. Only when brands act on these commitments can we begin to protect the health of people living near production sites, safeguard vital ecosystems, and move towards a fashion industry that no longer trades clean water and fertile land for cheap clothes.
