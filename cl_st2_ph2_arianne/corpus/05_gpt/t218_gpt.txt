In a year when the world was still reeling from the pandemic and the climate crisis was intensifying, people everywhere continued to step up and take action. Across continents, communities and activists refused to accept a return to the old “normal” of fossil fuel dependence and greenwashing. Instead, they put their bodies, creativity, and courage on the line to demand a safer, fairer future.

In Spain, activists confronted the fossil fuel industry head-on by blocking a fossil gas vessel. As governments and companies tried to rebrand gas as a “clean” or “transition” fuel, this action sent a clear message: fossil gas is part of the problem, not the solution. On the Adriatic coast in Croatia, activists turned their attention to a sunken gas rig, spotlighting the dangers and long-term impacts of fossil fuel infrastructure that outlives its usefulness but not its risks. Together, these actions challenged the narrative that fossil fuels can be managed safely or framed as climate-friendly.

In the United States, activists called for a complete phase-out of fossil fuels, insisting that climate pledges mean little if coal, oil, and gas continue to flow. Their demand was simple and uncompromising: to avoid the worst of climate breakdown, fossil fuels must stay in the ground. Thousands of kilometres away in Vanuatu, women stood at the forefront of the movement, demanding climate justice. Their leadership underlined a reality that is too often ignored: those who contribute least to the climate crisis are among those who face its most devastating impacts.

As governments gathered in Glasgow for COP26, people around the world mobilised to expose and challenge greenwashing. Protests outside and around the talks called out the empty promises and cosmetic pledges that allowed big polluters to maintain business as usual. Global actions demanded bolder measures from decision-makers, insisting that climate policy be measured by real-world emissions cuts, not public relations spin.

The pushback against greenwashing extended beyond the negotiating halls. In France, activists painted a plane to denounce aviation greenwashing, highlighting how the industry’s glossy sustainability claims clash with its growing climate impact. In Germany, a projection on a power plant turned a symbol of fossil-based energy into a canvas for truth-telling, making visible the ongoing reliance on polluting fuels at a time when a rapid shift to renewables is urgently needed.

In Brazil, Indigenous communities and allies focused on land demarcation, a crucial step for protecting forests, biodiversity, and cultural survival. Securing Indigenous territories is one of the most effective ways to safeguard ecosystems and stabilise the climate, and the struggle for demarcation is inseparable from the wider fight for climate justice.

In Indonesia, an “oligarchy monster” installation brought to life the shadowy forces driving environmental destruction. By giving a face and form to oligarchic power, the installation helped people see how political and economic elites profit from ecosystems being sacrificed and communities being pushed aside.

None of this would have been possible without the countless supporters who stand behind these actions: the people who show up, donate, share stories, and keep the pressure on. Their solidarity amplifies every banner raised, every ship blocked, every projection cast against the night sky.

The courage and creativity of these actions have been captured in powerful images available in the media library, documenting a year when, despite immense challenges, people around the world refused to give up on a livable planet.
