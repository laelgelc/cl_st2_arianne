Climate change is not just an environmental crisis; it is a profound injustice. Those who have contributed least to the problem are facing the most severe and immediate consequences, from deadly heat waves and prolonged droughts to devastating storms that destroy homes, livelihoods, and entire ways of life.

The unequal responsibility for climate change is stark. Since the 1750s, the United States alone has been responsible for more than a quarter of all cumulative greenhouse gas emissions, while the entire African continent has contributed only about 3%. Yet it is communities across Africa, along with many other parts of the Global South, that are already living with some of the harshest impacts: failing crops, water scarcity, and intensifying weather extremes that threaten food security and public health.

Inequality is also deeply rooted within countries and across income groups. Between 1990 and 2015, the wealthiest 5% of the world’s population were responsible for 36% of global emissions. In contrast, the poorest half of humanity contributed less than 6%. This means that the people with the fewest resources, and the least power to shape political decisions, are paying the price for a crisis they did almost nothing to cause.

Corporate responsibility is another critical part of this picture. Just twenty companies are linked to more than one-third of recent global emissions. Their business models, built on extracting and burning fossil fuels, have driven the climate crisis while communities on the frontlines struggle to survive its impacts. This concentration of responsibility underscores why voluntary pledges and half-measures are not enough; binding rules and real accountability are essential.

Some regions face not just hardship, but existential threats. Small island states confront rising seas and stronger storms that can wipe out infrastructure and render entire islands uninhabitable. In sub-Saharan Africa, climate impacts are already undermining agriculture, water supplies, and health systems, with consequences that ripple through societies and economies. For many people in these regions, climate change is not a future risk but a present emergency.

Addressing climate injustice means centering fairness and human rights in every climate decision. Wealthy nations and high-emitting actors must be held accountable for their outsized role in driving the crisis. This includes providing substantial financial support to countries and communities on the frontlines, both to help them adapt to unavoidable impacts and to address the losses and damages they are already experiencing.

Moments like the Glasgow climate conference are critical tests of whether governments, corporations, and financial institutions will act in line with this reality. Climate policies must be grounded in justice: rapid emission cuts from those most responsible, major financial transfers from rich to poorer countries, and strong mechanisms to hold big polluters to account.

Climate justice is not an optional add-on to climate action; it is at the heart of any meaningful solution. Without confronting the deep inequalities in who caused this crisis and who is suffering from it, the world cannot hope to build a safe, livable future for all.
