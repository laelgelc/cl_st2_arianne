For years, the global canned tuna industry has been built on practices that come at a devastating cost to people and the oceans. Forced labor, illegal fishing, ocean destruction, and opaque, untraceable supply chains have been allowed to flourish behind the labels on supermarket shelves. At the very center of this system sits Thai Union, the world’s largest canned tuna company.

Greenpeace has been campaigning to change that. Through sustained pressure from activists and consumers over the past two years, Thai Union is now engaging directly with Greenpeace and considering major reforms to how it does business. This moment matters far beyond a single company: what Thai Union does next could help transform the entire seafood industry.

The changes under consideration go to the heart of the problem. Thai Union is looking at reducing destructive fishing practices that damage marine ecosystems and contribute to overfishing. It is also examining ways to minimize labor abuse in its supply chains and to tackle illegal fishing and overfishing more broadly. Crucially, the company is exploring how to ensure full traceability, so that seafood can be tracked from ocean to can, making it harder for human rights abuses and environmental crimes to hide.

Because Thai Union is so large, the impact of any reforms it makes would ripple across the sector. The company owns well-known brands like Chicken of the Sea and supplies major retailers such as Walmart. If Thai Union raises its standards on fishing practices, labor conditions, and traceability, other companies will be pushed to follow or risk being left behind by consumers demanding better.

To help drive this change, Greenpeace has launched a video that brings together internet cats, mermaids, sharks, turtles, and activists with a clear message: the time for half-measures is over. The video calls for immediate, sweeping reforms to protect workers and the oceans, and to bring transparency to a supply chain that has long operated in the shadows.

Supporters are being urged to add their voices and demand that Thai Union acts now. By insisting on reduced destructive fishing, strong protections against labor abuse, real action on illegal fishing and overfishing, and full traceability, people around the world can help push the world’s largest canned tuna company—and with it, the wider industry—toward a future where seafood is not bought at the expense of human rights and a healthy ocean.
