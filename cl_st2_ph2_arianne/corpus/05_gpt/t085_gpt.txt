The world is facing a biodiversity crisis of staggering scale. One million species are now threatened with extinction as forests are cleared, oceans are emptied of fish, and ecosystems are stripped of their resources. These are not isolated problems; deforestation, overfishing, and destructive resource extraction are driving a breakdown of the natural systems that sustain life.

In response to this crisis, governments have gathered under the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), a global agreement meant to safeguard nature. Yet progress has been painfully slow. The CBD has suffered from weak implementation, vague commitments, and a lack of accountability. Without clear mechanisms to ensure that promises translate into real protection on the ground, biodiversity continues to decline.

This is why the decisions made at COP15 are so critical. At this conference, governments have the opportunity—and responsibility—to turn the tide. A central issue is finance. Protecting and restoring ecosystems at the scale needed requires substantial funding, especially in the Global South, where much of the world’s remaining biodiversity is found. Rich countries in the Global North have a particular responsibility to provide this support.

Currently, there is a $700 billion annual gap between what is being spent and what is needed to halt and reverse biodiversity loss. Closing this gap means not only increasing funding, but also stopping the flow of money that is actively harming nature. Harmful subsidies that drive deforestation, overfishing, and ecosystem destruction must be redirected toward protecting and restoring nature instead.

Any credible global plan to protect biodiversity must recognize who has been safeguarding it all along. Indigenous Peoples are stewards of around 80% of the world’s remaining biodiversity. Their lands, knowledge, and governance systems are central to keeping ecosystems healthy. Respecting and securing Indigenous Peoples’ rights is therefore not optional; it is essential to any successful biodiversity strategy.

This also means rejecting “fortress conservation” models that exclude or displace Indigenous Peoples and local communities. Conservation that treats people as a threat rather than as rights-holders and partners has a long and harmful history. Instead, Indigenous Peoples and local communities must be at the heart of conservation efforts, with their rights fully recognized and upheld.

One of the key proposals on the table is the “30x30” target: conserving at least 30% of the world’s land and water by 2030. On paper, this could be a powerful tool for biodiversity protection. But how it is implemented will determine whether it helps or harms. For 30x30 to be effective and just, it must center Indigenous Peoples and local communities, uphold their rights, and build on their leadership in caring for biodiversity.

At COP15, governments must move beyond weak promises and adopt clear, enforceable mechanisms that match the scale of the crisis. That means closing the biodiversity finance gap, ending harmful subsidies, recognizing and protecting Indigenous Peoples’ rights, rejecting exclusionary conservation, and ensuring that any global targets—like 30x30—are grounded in justice and community leadership.

The biodiversity crisis is not a distant threat. It is unfolding now, and the decisions made today will shape the future of countless species, including our own.
