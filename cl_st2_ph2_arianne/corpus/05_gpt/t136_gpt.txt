For 21 days, Cristiane Mazzetti traveled deep along the Manicoré River in the Amazon, joining a journey that was both scientific expedition and a continuation of a long struggle for justice. For 16 years, local communities in this region have been fighting for their territorial rights and the protection of the forest that sustains their lives, culture, and livelihoods.

This expedition brought together riverside communities and scientists from the National Institute for Amazonian Research (INPA). Along the Manicoré, they carried out biodiversity research focused on birds, mammals, botany, fish, reptiles, amphibians, and even fossils. The work went far beyond collecting data: it created important spaces for exchange between academic science and traditional knowledge, recognizing the deep understanding that local people hold about the forest and its cycles.

Visits to the communities along the river revealed everyday practices that show how it is possible to live with the forest without destroying it. Families are harvesting andiroba oil, açaí, cocoa, and cassava through agroforestry systems that combine food production, income generation, and forest conservation. These practices demonstrate that standing forest is not an obstacle to development but the basis for a different and more sustainable way of life.

One of the central achievements celebrated during the expedition was the securing of a CDRU document, which grants land use rights to local communities. This step strengthens their capacity to defend their territory and supports the ongoing push to create a Sustainable Development Reserve in the region. Such a reserve would help secure long-term protection for the forest while recognizing the role of traditional populations as its guardians.

All of this is happening in a context where the Amazon continues to face serious threats from deforestation and land grabbing. These pressures are part of broader environmental challenges in Brazil, where forests and the people who protect them remain under constant risk. Yet, amid these difficulties, the Manicoré expedition renewed a sense of hope. The combination of community resistance, scientific collaboration, and concrete advances in land rights showed that it is still possible to defend the forest and support those who have been on the frontlines of this struggle for years.
