Dorothy Stowe would be 100 years old this year. Ten years have passed since she died in Vancouver, the city where she helped co-found Greenpeace with her husband Irving and a small circle of pacifists and ecologists. Yet her presence is still felt wherever people gather to protect the planet with courage, humility, and care for one another.

A photograph from 2009 shows Dorothy at a CD release party for the legendary 1970 concert featuring Joni Mitchell and James Taylor. That concert helped launch what would become Greenpeace. In the image, she is not at the centre of the stage, not seeking the spotlight, but simply there—quietly supporting, encouraging, and helping make things happen. It’s a fitting snapshot of how she moved through the world.

Dorothy’s activism was defined by unwavering dedication and modesty. She focused on the issues, not on herself. She volunteered for any task that needed doing, whether or not it was glamorous or visible. What mattered to her was that the work advanced peace, justice, and protection of the Earth. This consistency of purpose, carried through decades, made her a moral anchor for those around her.

She was also unintimidated by power. Even when dealing with figures such as Canada’s Prime Minister, Dorothy did not back down. Her calm resolve and clarity of purpose allowed her to speak truth to power without bluster. She understood that courage could be quiet and that principled persistence could be more powerful than confrontation for its own sake.

Dorothy and Irving’s lives were rooted in a deep commitment to justice long before Greenpeace was born. They chose to hold their wedding at the headquarters of the NAACP, aligning this personal milestone with the broader struggle for civil rights. They became Quakers, dedicating themselves to peace and justice as a spiritual calling as well as a political and ethical one. Even the name they chose together—“Stowe,” in honour of Harriet Beecher Stowe—reflected their desire to stand in a tradition of resistance to injustice.

In Greenpeace’s early years, Dorothy and Irving provided a stabilizing, inclusive influence. Movements, especially in their beginnings, can be turbulent—full of strong personalities, big ideas, and inevitable disagreements. Dorothy helped hold people together, not by force of ego, but by example: hard work, kindness, and a refusal to give up on either the mission or the people carrying it out.

Those who worked alongside her were inspired not only by what she did, but by how she did it. She showed that effective activism could be grounded in modesty and kindness, that one could be uncompromising on principles while generous with people. Her combination of hard work and heart helped shape Greenpeace’s character in its formative years and left a legacy that continues to guide those who follow.

Marking the centenary of Dorothy Stowe’s birth is not just an act of remembrance. It is a reminder that movements grow strong when they are rooted in values lived every day: dedication, humility, inclusion, and a steadfast commitment to peace and justice. Dorothy embodied those values, and through the organisation she helped build, her influence endures.
