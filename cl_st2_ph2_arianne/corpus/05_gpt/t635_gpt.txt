The mud came without warning. In a matter of moments, 13 million cubic meters of toxic mining waste surged through Brumadinho, Brazil, after the collapse of a Vale-operated tailings dam, killing 110 people and leaving more than 230 others missing. It was a catastrophe measured not only in lives lost, but in a river poisoned and a way of life abruptly torn apart.

Downstream, the Pataxó Hã-hã-hãe Indigenous community watched the Paraopeba River turn from a source of food, culture and spirituality into a thick, toxic sludge. In the Naô Xohã village, the river had been central to daily life. People fished in it and bathed in it. Children played on its banks. Now, those same waters are contaminated, making both fishing and bathing impossible. What was once a lifeline has become a threat.

Community leaders Hayô and Werymerry describe their despair as they confront this new reality. They speak not only of the immediate destruction, but of a deep fear rooted in memory. Just a few years earlier, in 2015, another tailings dam collapse in Mariana, also in Minas Gerais state, had already shown what mining disasters can do to rivers, communities and ecosystems. For the Pataxó Hã-hã-hãe, the Brumadinho collapse is not an isolated incident; it is another chapter in a pattern of devastation.

The loss for Naô Xohã is not only material. The river is tied to identity, culture and spirituality. Its contamination affects the community’s food security, health and social fabric. The most vulnerable members of the community are now even more exposed, as families who depended on the river are forced to rely on outside donations to survive. Everyday activities that once defined life in the village have been replaced by uncertainty and grief.

In their statements, Hayô and Werymerry make clear that this tragedy reinforces their opposition to mining on Indigenous lands. For them, the Brumadinho disaster is proof that the risks of mining extend far beyond mine boundaries and corporate promises of safety. They point to the repeated failures of tailings dams and the profound consequences for Indigenous peoples and the environment.

Greenpeace has been on the ground documenting the tragedy and its impacts on the Pataxó Hã-hã-hãe and the Paraopeba River. By bearing witness to the contamination, the loss of livelihood and the emotional toll on Naô Xohã, Greenpeace is amplifying the voices of those most affected and demanding that those responsible be held to account. Justice, in this context, means more than compensation: it means recognition of the community’s suffering, guarantees of non-repetition and respect for Indigenous rights and territories.

As the mud settles along the Paraopeba’s banks, the Pataxó Hã-hã-hãe face an uncertain future in a village whose river can no longer be trusted. Their calls for justice and for an end to mining on Indigenous lands echo far beyond Naô Xohã, reminding the world that the true cost of mining disasters is borne first and hardest by communities who did nothing to cause them.
