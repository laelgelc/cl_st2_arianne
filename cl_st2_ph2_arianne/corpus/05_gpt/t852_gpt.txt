In late 2015, Greenpeace launched the Detox Outdoor campaign with a clear goal: eliminate hazardous PFCs from the weatherproofing used in outdoor gear. These chemicals, long used to make clothing and equipment water- and stain-resistant, were found in products from major outdoor brands. The campaign set out to push the industry toward safer, PFC-free alternatives.

A central focus quickly emerged: Gore Fabrics, the company behind GORE-TEX®, a material widely used in jackets, shoes and other outdoor products from well-known brands such as The North Face and Mammut. Because of its dominant role in the market, a commitment from Gore had the potential to transform the entire outdoor industry.

That transformation is now underway. Gore Fabrics has committed to remove hazardous PFCs from its general outdoor laminates by 2020, and from its specialized laminates by 2023. This means that over time, products using GORE-TEX® from major brands will be made without these hazardous chemicals in their weatherproofing materials.

This outcome did not happen on its own. It is the result of sustained pressure from the outdoor community and Greenpeace supporters around the world. Hundreds of thousands of people took action: signing online petitions, voting on which products should be tested, and taking part in more than 150 activities globally that called on brands to change their practices. Together, these actions sent a clear message that people who love nature do not want their gear to pollute it.

Some companies moved early and helped show that change was possible. Brands like Paramo, Rotauf and Vaude became leaders by signing commitments to go PFC-free before Gore’s announcement. Their decisions demonstrated that functional outdoor gear can be made without hazardous PFCs, and they used their influence to urge Gore Fabrics to follow suit.

The commitment from Gore Fabrics marks a major step in the Detox Outdoor journey. It reflects the combined impact of persistent campaigning, the leadership of early-moving brands, and the determination of hundreds of thousands of people who demanded gear that protects both them and the environment.
