When Hiroshima was bombed, Hiroshi Harada was just six years old. He was at Hiroshima Station with his father when the atomic bomb exploded. In the chaos that followed, they escaped through flames and falling rubble, surviving an attack that instantly transformed the city and countless lives.

Decades later, Harada became the director of the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum, dedicating his life to ensuring that what he witnessed as a child would not be forgotten. In his role, he faced difficult decisions and resistance as he tried to share Hiroshima’s story beyond Japan.

One major challenge came when the museum agreed to loan artifacts for an exhibition in the United States. The aim was to show the reality of the atomic bombing and its human impact. However, the exhibition was ultimately cancelled after encountering strong resistance, reflecting how contested and sensitive the history of nuclear weapons remains.

Harada was also deeply involved in efforts to have the Genbaku Dome (the Atomic Bomb Dome) recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage site. Even this attempt to protect a symbol of Hiroshima’s destruction and memory met opposition, including from the United States and China. Despite this, the push for UNESCO status was driven by a determination to preserve the site as a warning to the world about the consequences of nuclear war.

Now, as the number of survivors decreases and their memories fade with age, Harada emphasizes how urgent it is to preserve their testimonies. He believes that connecting these lived experiences to younger generations is essential to conveying the true horror of nuclear weapons. For him, remembering Hiroshima is not only about the past; it is a vital act to prevent nuclear weapons from ever being used again.
