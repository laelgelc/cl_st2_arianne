Fast fashion promises a circular future where every garment is reused, recycled, or repurposed. But in reality, this “circularity” often means exporting the problem out of sight – and onto communities and ecosystems in the Global South.

Kenya offers a stark example of how this plays out. In 2019 alone, the country imported around 185,000 tonnes of used clothing. On paper, these imports are framed as second-hand clothes that extend the life of garments and provide affordable options for people. But for many of the vendors on the ground, what arrives in bales of Mitumba is not quality used clothing – it’s waste.

Vendors report that a significant share of these bales is filled with poor-quality, damaged or completely unusable items. Between 30% and 40% of the imported clothing is estimated to be unusable. That translates into a daily flood of textile waste: roughly 150 to 200 tonnes of clothing dumped or burnt every single day.

The impacts are visible in places like Dandora dumpsite and along the Nairobi River, where mountains of discarded textiles pile up or are set on fire. These clothes – produced in excess by brands in the Global North – end up polluting soil and water, clogging waterways, and filling the air with toxic smoke when burned. The communities living and working around these sites are left to deal with the health and environmental consequences of a system they did not create.

This is not circularity. It is a form of neocolonial dumping: a flow of overproduced, low-quality garments from the Global North to the Global South under the guise of reuse, shifting the burden of waste management and pollution onto countries least responsible for the overproduction crisis.

To change this, the fashion industry must tackle the problem at its source. That means producing fewer clothes overall, and focusing on garments that are durable, repairable, and made to last. It also means ending the practice of exporting unmanageable waste streams as “second-hand goods” and instead supporting local manufacturing and textile economies that can meet people’s needs without flooding them with junk.

Policy can play a critical role. The EU’s textile strategy is a step towards holding brands accountable for the full life cycle of their products and reducing the volume of waste generated. But the scale and cross-border nature of the problem demand more than regional action. A global treaty is needed to stop fashion waste dumping, set clear rules for responsibility and waste prevention, and protect communities and ecosystems from becoming the final destination of the world’s discarded clothes.
