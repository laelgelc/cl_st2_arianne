Nature & Youth and Greenpeace Nordic, together with a broad coalition, have taken the Norwegian government to court to stop new Arctic oil exploration by Statoil in the Barents Sea. This legal challenge is rooted in a simple but powerful idea: the Norwegian state must live up to its own Constitution and its international climate promises.

The case is led by Ingrid Skjoldvær of Nature & Youth and Truls Gulowsen of Greenpeace Nordic. They are invoking Article 112 of Norway’s Constitution, which guarantees the right to a healthy environment for current and future generations. By opening new oil fields in the Arctic, the government is putting this constitutional right at risk.

The lawsuit also demands that Norway respect the 1.5°C warming limit set out in the Paris Agreement. While Norway has pledged to cut emissions and support global climate action, it is simultaneously planning new drilling in the Barents Sea. This contradiction lies at the heart of the case: a country cannot credibly promise climate leadership while expanding fossil fuel extraction.

Science shows that to avoid climate catastrophe, at least 80% of known fossil fuel reserves must stay in the ground. New Arctic oil exploration moves the world in the opposite direction, locking in emissions for decades and threatening fragile polar ecosystems.

This legal action is people-powered. It brings together citizens and organisations who refuse to accept that short-term fossil fuel interests should override the rights of future generations and the commitments made in Paris. By challenging Arctic drilling in court, the coalition aims not only to protect the Arctic, but also to inspire movements around the world to resist new fossil fuel projects and push governments to honour their climate obligations.
