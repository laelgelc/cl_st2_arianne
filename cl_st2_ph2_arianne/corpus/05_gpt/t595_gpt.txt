In May, Israel experienced more than a thousand wildfires during a period of record-breaking heat that reached up to 45°C. These extreme conditions led to evacuations and the loss of homes, and were linked to climate change. Rising temperatures, more frequent and intense heat waves, and drier conditions all contribute to making fires more likely and more destructive.

The Middle East has already warmed by 1.5°C, which is 50% higher than the global average. This rapid warming is changing the region’s seasons. A study warns that by the end of the century, summers in the region will become longer and winters shorter. This shift is expected to increase both droughts and the risk of wildfires, putting communities, ecosystems, and infrastructure under growing pressure.

Greenpeace is calling for an immediate halt to fossil fuel prospecting in the Mediterranean and a rapid shift towards renewable energy. Ending new fossil fuel exploration is crucial to limiting further warming and reducing the conditions that fuel dangerous wildfires.

People can also help reduce fire risks through everyday actions. It is important to fully extinguish cigarettes and any open fires, never leave flames unattended, and report any wildfires as soon as they are spotted. In terms of safety, the advice is to evacuate in the case of forest fires, smother grass fires where it is safe to do so, and alert neighbors to danger so they can act quickly.
