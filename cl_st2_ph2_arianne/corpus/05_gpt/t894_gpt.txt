On 18 May 2016, the Norwegian government took a step that runs directly counter to the global effort to tackle climate change: it granted new Arctic oil drilling licenses to 13 oil companies. The decision was presented by the petroleum minister as a “new chapter” for the country’s oil industry, even as that same industry is facing serious trouble. Shell has already pulled out of Arctic drilling, Norwegian oil production has been cut in half compared to its peak, and oil prices have plunged. Instead of prompting a rethink, these warning signs are being used to justify pushing even further into one of the most fragile and climate‑critical regions on Earth.

This move comes just months after governments around the world agreed in Paris to limit global warming, and shortly after Norway and the United States announced a joint deal on Arctic sustainability. Handing out new licenses in the Arctic is in stark contrast with those commitments. The Arctic is warming faster than the rest of the planet, and decisions made there have global consequences. Yet some industry leaders are still treating a warming world as a business opportunity. Chevron’s CEO has even suggested that climate change could be “beneficial” for gas production, revealing how deeply out of step the fossil fuel industry is with climate science and the public interest.

While politicians and oil executives celebrate new drilling, civil society groups are charting a different course. In Norway, organisations including Greenpeace are seeking a constitutional review that would test the country’s environmental rights protections. At the heart of this effort is a simple question: can a government that has committed to climate action and environmental protection still open up new areas of the Arctic to oil drilling?

If Norway’s highest legal principles are found to protect citizens’ right to a healthy environment and a stable climate, this could become the basis for court action. Such a case would not just be about one set of licenses; it would be about the kind of future Norway chooses. Will the country double down on risky Arctic oil, or seize the chance to lead on renewable energy instead?

The push for a constitutional review offers a real source of hope. It shows that people are not willing to accept decisions that lock us into more fossil fuels at the expense of the climate. It shows that environmental rights are not abstract ideals, but tools that can be used to challenge destructive projects and demand a different path.

At a time when the Paris Agreement and international Arctic commitments call for rapid cuts in emissions and protection of vulnerable regions, Norway’s new Arctic licenses send the wrong signal. Yet they also sharpen the contrast between a fading fossil fuel past and a cleaner, safer future. By turning to the courts and to the language of rights, civil society is insisting that the law – and our politics – catch up with the reality of climate change, and that the promise of a renewable future is taken more seriously than the lure of Arctic oil.
