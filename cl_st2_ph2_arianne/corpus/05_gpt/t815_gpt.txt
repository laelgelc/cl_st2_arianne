Across France and Belgium, nuclear power plants are sitting on a risk that should worry us all: poorly protected pools of highly radioactive spent fuel. Independent experts, commissioned by Greenpeace, have compared this situation to a “Sword of Damocles” hanging over millions of people.

Their report, submitted to authorities in France, Belgium, Germany, Switzerland, and Luxembourg, focuses on one critical weak point: the storage pools where spent nuclear fuel is kept to cool down. These pools contain very large quantities of radioactive material. Yet, unlike reactor buildings, which are housed in reinforced structures, these pools are not adequately protected against modern-day threats.

Since 9/11, the world has had to reckon with the possibility of deliberate attacks using aircraft, explosives, or other means. The report warns that current protections around spent fuel pools are not designed to withstand such scenarios, whether the threat comes from organized criminals or isolated individuals. This gap leaves a dangerous vulnerability at the heart of nuclear facilities.

If a spent fuel pool were to be damaged, it could lose its cooling water. Without sufficient cooling, the fuel could overheat, potentially releasing massive amounts of radioactivity into the environment. This is not a distant theoretical risk: it is a direct consequence of failing to secure some of the most hazardous materials on the planet.

Greenpeace is calling on the operators of these plants—EDF in France and Engie-Electrabel in Belgium—to urgently reinforce the protection of spent fuel storage. Strengthening these defences is essential to reduce the risk of a catastrophic release of radioactivity.

Because of the sensitivity of the information involved, Greenpeace is not publishing the full expert report. Instead, an executive summary has been made available so that the public, media, and decision-makers can understand the scale and nature of the problem without revealing details that could themselves create security risks.

The message is clear: as long as these vulnerabilities remain, communities in and around these nuclear plants are exposed to unnecessary danger. Protecting people and the environment means treating spent fuel pools with the same seriousness and security as reactor cores themselves.
