In 2015, Greenpeace Mexico’s campaign for healthy food took important steps toward promoting ecological farming that empowers farmers and respects consumers. The work focused on both scientific research and collaboration with communities, governments, and companies.

A key moment was the tour of the Esperanza ship, which allowed scientists to collect samples in Sinaloa and the Mexican Caribbean to detect the presence of pesticides and fertilizers. These samples are expected to provide concrete data once the results are available, helping to better understand the impact of industrial agriculture on Mexico’s waters and ecosystems.

The Esperanza tour was not only about science. It also created a platform to engage directly with food companies, pressing them to be more transparent about how and where food is produced. This push for transparency was supported by 50,000 consumers, demonstrating that people in Mexico are demanding healthier food and more responsible practices from the food industry.

In the Yucatan Peninsula, the campaign worked closely with Mayan communities, other NGOs, and local governments. Together, they highlighted the importance of traditional milpa systems, which are based on growing diverse crops such as corn, beans, and squash. These systems reflect a long-standing ecological approach to agriculture that supports biodiversity and community resilience.

This collaboration contributed to a significant political commitment: the governor of Yucatan pledged to adopt, by 2018, a strategy to support ecological farming rooted in these diverse, traditional cropping systems. This commitment marked a concrete step toward integrating ecological practices into public policy, with the potential to benefit both farmers and consumers.

Through these efforts in 2015—combining scientific sampling, consumer mobilization, engagement with companies, and alliances with Indigenous communities and local authorities—Greenpeace Mexico’s healthy food campaign advanced its goal of fostering ecological farming that protects the environment and strengthens food sovereignty.
