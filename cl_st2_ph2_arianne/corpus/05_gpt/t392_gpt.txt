When the COVID-19 pandemic began, many of us were suddenly forced to think differently about what it means to be safe. For Jen Maman, that reflection started at home, feeling relatively secure with her daughter while the world outside felt increasingly uncertain. From that place of personal safety, she listened to colleagues around the world describe what safety means to them, and how far many communities still are from experiencing it.

Those conversations revealed a shared understanding: real safety is about much more than the absence of immediate danger or the presence of armed protection. Colleagues spoke about safety as having reliable access to clean water, clean air, and healthy food. They linked safety to fair and accessible healthcare systems that care for everyone, not just those who can afford it. They described the importance of governments that confront inequality rather than deepen it, and that take meaningful climate action so that people are not forced to live with constant threats from floods, fires, storms, and other environmental disasters.

Against this vision of safety, current global spending priorities look deeply out of step. One striking comparison highlighted in the reflection is that the cost of a single $3.4 billion submarine could instead fund 30 hospitals. It is a stark illustration of how public money is being directed toward military hardware rather than the systems and services that actually keep people well and secure in their daily lives.

The imbalance is particularly visible in the United States, where spending on defense is six times higher than spending on education. This is happening even as global peace is in decline. The resources poured into weapons and war preparations are not translating into a safer, more peaceful world. Instead, communities are facing multiple, overlapping crises: a pandemic that has exposed and worsened existing inequalities, police violence that undermines trust and safety in public spaces, and escalating environmental disasters fueled by climate change.

In this context, the reflection argues that if we are serious about safety, we need to rethink what we fund and why. It calls for redirecting public money away from excessive military spending and towards the things that actually make people safe: strong public healthcare systems that can withstand crises like COVID-19; clean energy that reduces pollution and tackles the climate emergency; and robust support for communities so they can meet basic needs, recover from shocks, and build resilient futures.

The experiences shared by Jen and her colleagues point toward a simple but powerful conclusion: true safety is collective. It depends on the health of our planet, the fairness of our institutions, and the strength of our public systems. Investing in those foundations is how we create a world where everyone can feel as safe at home as Jen did with her daughter—during this pandemic and beyond.
