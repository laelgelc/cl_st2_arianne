For three years running, global brand audits have identified Coca-Cola, Nestlé, and PepsiCo as the world’s top plastic polluters. This is not a coincidence or a temporary spike in waste; it is the predictable result of a business model built on single-use plastic and a refusal to move away from fossil fuels.

These companies continue to invest in what Greenpeace calls false solutions—approaches that sound promising but fail to tackle the root causes of plastic pollution. Instead of fundamentally reducing plastic production, they partner with oil companies to produce even more plastic, locking in dependence on fossil fuels and worsening the climate crisis.

Plastic is not just a litter problem. It is made 99% from fossil fuels, tying every bottle, wrapper, and sachet directly to the extraction and burning of coal, oil, and gas. From production to disposal, plastic is toxic throughout its entire lifecycle. It harms communities and ecosystems where it is produced, used, and discarded, and it accelerates climate breakdown at every stage.

Despite decades of industry rhetoric about recycling, only 2% of plastic is recycled in a truly circular way—turned back into material that can be used again and again without degrading. The rest is burned, dumped, landfilled, or downcycled into lower-quality products that will eventually become waste. This is not a circular system; it is a linear pipeline from fossil fuels to pollution.

To break this cycle, Coca-Cola, Nestlé, and PepsiCo must rapidly end their reliance on single-use plastic packaging. That means redesigning their business models around refill and reuse, not just tweaking packaging or shifting to other disposables. It also means moving away from fossil fuels across their supply chains and openly supporting strong regulations that cut plastic production and use at the source.

Millions of people around the world are already demanding this shift. Through petitions, lobbying, and community actions, they are pushing governments and corporations to adopt refill and reuse systems that dramatically reduce plastic waste. This growing movement is clear: real solutions exist, and they start with using less plastic, not producing more of it.

The path forward is simple but urgent. Major brands must stop driving plastic production, stop relying on fossil fuels, and back the regulations and systems that make refill and reuse the norm. Only then can we seriously reduce their plastic footprint and confront the climate crisis that plastic is helping to fuel.
