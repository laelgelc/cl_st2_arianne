Across the globe, more than one million people have already taken a stand against single-use plastics, sending a powerful message to the corporations driving the plastic pollution crisis. From local bans on throwaway items to community cleanups that carefully sort and audit what’s collected, people are shining a light on which companies are most responsible and demanding real change.

These community cleanups are about more than removing trash from beaches, rivers, and neighborhoods. By documenting and auditing the brands and types of plastic collected, communities are holding corporations accountable for the waste they produce and the damage it causes. Local bans on single-use plastics are showing what’s possible when people come together and push decision-makers to act.

Building on this momentum, Greenpeace is introducing the goal of “A Million Acts of Blue.” An Act of Blue is any action that prevents single-use plastic from being created in the first place. It’s rooted in the idea that protecting our planet means stopping pollution at its source and making sure corporations take responsibility for the plastic they put into the world.

An Act of Blue can look like many different things, but all of them share a common purpose: preventing single-use plastics before they become pollution. To support people everywhere in taking these steps, Greenpeace is sharing a toolkit designed to help communities organize and scale up their efforts.

The toolkit includes guides for giving presentations that inform neighbors, schools, and local groups about the impacts of single-use plastics and what can be done to stop them. It offers tips for reaching out to local media so that community actions and solutions get the attention they deserve. It also provides strategies for targeting supermarkets to reduce their reliance on unnecessary plastic packaging, and for urging fast food chains to eliminate throwaway items from their operations.

With every local ban, every cleanup that tracks which companies are polluting, and every community action inspired by the toolkit, people are adding to a growing wave of Acts of Blue. Together, these actions are pushing corporations to move away from single-use plastics and toward systems that protect our planet instead of polluting it.
