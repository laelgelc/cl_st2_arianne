The planet is heating like never before. Record temperatures are being broken again and again, and climate disasters are escalating in regions all around the world. Heatwaves, storms and other extremes are becoming more frequent and intense, and the damage they cause is growing. This isn’t a distant threat: it is already reshaping daily life and putting millions of people at risk.

In this new reality, how we move, eat, shop and organize together really matters. One of the most urgent habits to reconsider is our reliance on cars. Car use is a major source of pollution, and in extreme heat it can be especially dangerous. Roads and parking lots trap and radiate heat, exhaust worsens air quality, and sitting in traffic on scorching days can be hazardous for health. Choosing public transport instead can cut pollution, reduce congestion and help make cities more liveable in a hotter world.

There are many practical solutions we can embrace right now. Planting trees and flowers helps cool our streets and neighbourhoods, provides shade and supports biodiversity. Shifting to plant-based diets reduces the strain on the planet while also cutting emissions linked to industrial animal agriculture. Avoiding plastics wherever possible reduces pollution and the fossil fuel demand that drives their production. At the same time, we can push for a rapid shift to renewable energy so that our homes, workplaces and transport systems are powered by wind, sun and other clean sources instead of coal, oil and gas.

Amid rising fear and anxiety about the future, it’s vital to hold on to hope. Hope is not about ignoring the danger; it’s about recognising our power to change course. That means taking action beyond our individual choices. People everywhere can join protests against fossil fuels, demand climate justice for the communities hit first and worst, and call on governments and institutions to declare climate emergencies and act accordingly. Collective pressure is essential to phase out fossil fuels and build fair, renewable-powered societies.

As extreme heat becomes more common, survival in the short term is as important as transformation in the long term. There are simple but crucial steps to protect ourselves and each other when temperatures soar. Staying hydrated is key: drink water regularly, even before you feel thirsty. Eating lightly can help your body cope better with the heat. Slowing down, especially during the hottest parts of the day, reduces the risk of heat-related illness. Whenever possible, stay cool indoors, using fans or other cooling methods, and dress lightly in breathable clothing.

No one should face extreme heat alone. Building support networks with neighbours, friends, family and colleagues can save lives: checking in on each other, sharing cool spaces, and helping those who are more vulnerable. These same networks can become the foundation for organizing to combat climate change more broadly, turning mutual care into collective power.

The planet’s unprecedented heating is a warning and a call to action. By changing how we travel, what we eat, what we buy and how we organize, we can protect ourselves in the heat of today while fighting for a cooler, safer tomorrow.
