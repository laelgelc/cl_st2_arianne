The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed, with painful clarity, just how fragile life is. It has also reminded us of a truth that Indigenous Peoples have voiced for generations: human beings are inseparable from the web of life that sustains us. When forests fall, rivers are poisoned, and animals are driven from their habitats, it is not only ecosystems that suffer—it is our collective future, our health, and our very survival.

For Indigenous Peoples in Brazil, this understanding is not an abstract idea. It is lived knowledge, rooted in daily relationships with forests, waters, and all beings that share these territories. From this perspective, the pandemic is not an isolated tragedy. It is part of a broader pattern of imbalance driven by a predatory economic model that treats nature as an infinite resource to be exploited, rather than a living system on which all life depends.

The destruction of biodiversity is not only a crime against nature; it is also a direct threat to human life. As habitats are destroyed and ecosystems are destabilised, the risks of new pandemics grow. When we invade forests, displace species, and push the natural world to its limits, we create the conditions for new diseases to emerge and spread. Caring for Mother Earth is therefore not a secondary concern or a distant ideal—it is an urgent, practical necessity to prevent future crises.

Indigenous Peoples in Brazil have been on the frontlines of this struggle since the first colonial invasions. Over centuries, they have resisted dispossession, violence, and attempts to erase their cultures and ways of life. With each new wave of aggression, Indigenous communities have adapted their strategies to defend their rights and territories. In recent decades, this has included making use of the tools offered by Brazil’s own legal and political system, especially the Federal Constitution, which recognises Indigenous rights and the duty of the state to protect the environment.

This adaptation does not mean abandoning ancestral knowledge; it means bringing that knowledge into new arenas of struggle. In courts, in parliaments, in public debates, Indigenous leaders have insisted that defending their territories is inseparable from defending the climate, biodiversity, and the health of all people. The fight for Indigenous rights is, at the same time, a fight for a different model of development—one that does not sacrifice lives and ecosystems in the name of short-term profit.

In this context, the Articulation of Indigenous Peoples of Brazil (APIB) has taken a crucial step. Together with allies, including Greenpeace Brazil and political parties, APIB has brought a case before Brazil’s Supreme Court. The goal is clear: to compel the federal government to fulfil its duty to protect the Amazon, the forests, the waters, and all forms of life that depend on them.

This legal action is more than a technical measure. It is a demand for coherence between what is written in the Constitution and what happens on the ground. It calls on the state to stop turning a blind eye to the destruction of the Amazon and to recognise that protecting Indigenous territories and ecosystems is a constitutional obligation, not an option.

By going to the Supreme Court, APIB and its allies are affirming that the defence of life must be at the centre of public policy. They are asserting that the Amazon is not a frontier to be conquered, but a living system that regulates climate, sustains cultures, and supports countless species. They are insisting that rivers are not mere channels for transport or waste, but veins of the Earth that carry life.

The pandemic has shown how quickly a crisis can spread across borders, affecting everyone regardless of wealth, nationality, or social status. It has also shown that the most vulnerable—among them many Indigenous communities—often bear the heaviest burdens. Yet those same communities are offering pathways out of the crisis, grounded in respect for nature and for the interconnectedness of all beings.

Listening to Indigenous voices means recognising that there can be no healthy humanity on a sick planet. It means understanding that the destruction of the Amazon and other biomes is not only an environmental issue but a profound social, cultural, and ethical one. It means accepting that the economic model that fuels deforestation and biodiversity loss is putting all of us at risk.

The case led by APIB, with the support of Greenpeace Brazil and other allies, is a call to reorient our priorities. It asks the highest court in the country to affirm that protecting forests and waters is essential to protecting life itself. It is a reminder that legal instruments, when guided by Indigenous leadership and collective mobilisation, can become powerful tools for safeguarding the future.

In this moment of global uncertainty, the message from Indigenous Peoples is both urgent and hopeful: if we care for Mother Earth, she will continue to care for us. If we choose to defend forests, rivers, and all beings, we will be defending our own lives and those of generations to come. The path forward lies in heeding this wisdom and turning it into concrete action—before it is too late.
