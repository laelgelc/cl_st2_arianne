Far beneath the surface of the Atlantic Ocean, 750 meters down, lies a place that looks like an abandoned metropolis: the Lost City. Discovered just 20 years ago, this extraordinary hydrothermal vent site rises from the seafloor like a ghostly skyline, its strange formations earning it a reputation as one of the most otherworldly landscapes on our planet.

The Lost City is not only visually striking; it is also scientifically significant. Its vents and unique ecosystems may hold vital clues about how life on Earth began. In this hidden world, life thrives in complete darkness under immense pressure, powered not by sunlight, but by chemical energy from the seafloor. Studying sites like the Lost City helps scientists understand the conditions that could have sparked the first living organisms.

Today, this fragile and irreplaceable ecosystem faces a growing threat: deep sea mining. Companies are increasingly interested in extracting rare earth minerals from the ocean floor, and sites like the Lost City could be targeted. The disturbance, noise, and pollution from mining operations could irreversibly damage these delicate environments, wiping out species and destroying natural laboratories that help us answer fundamental questions about our own origins.

To bring the Lost City’s beauty and strangeness to the surface, artists are stepping in. Illustrators including Quentin Blake and Charlie Adlard have launched an Instagram #DrawThisInYourStyle challenge, inviting artists everywhere to imagine and depict the Lost City in their own way. By turning this remote, little-known place into a subject of creativity and wonder, they hope to build a wave of public support for its protection.

Anyone can take part. Artists are encouraged to post their interpretations on Instagram using the hashtags #TheLostCityInYourStyle and #ProtectTheOceans, helping more people discover this remarkable underwater world. Participants are also urged to sign a petition calling for a strong Global Ocean Treaty and to learn more about how we can protect the oceans from destructive activities like deep sea mining.

By sharing art, signing the petition, and spreading the word, people everywhere can help defend a place most of us will never see in person—but whose fate is closely tied to the health of our blue planet.
