Becoming a mother sharpened the way I see the world. The sleepless nights, the laughter, the fear when my child is sick, the fierce instinct to protect—these are deeply personal experiences. But they are also political, because they exist in a world where climate change is destroying homes, tearing families apart, and cutting lives short.

When I think about the joy of watching a child grow, I cannot separate it from the reality that so many parents are watching their children lose everything to floods, storms, droughts and fires. Climate change is not an abstract concept. It is destruction, displacement and death—for many, it is the end of the places and ways of life they love.

Yet, in the middle of this, I find hope in people who resist. Communities are standing up to destructive projects, defending their land, water and future. I draw strength from the African philosophy of Ubuntu: “I am because we are.” It reminds me that our lives are bound together, that my child’s future is connected to the futures of children in every corner of the world. It also reminds me that climate and environmental justice are not optional—they are essential.

Justice means naming those responsible. Extractive companies and the governments that enable them must stop the destruction. They must admit their crimes and pay for the damage they have caused, especially in low-income countries that did little to create this crisis but are paying the highest price. Climate change is not just about emissions; it is about power, accountability and repair.

My own story begins in Cameroon. I grew up playing in forests, surrounded by the richness of nature. I also saw floods and the fear they brought. I watched my mother struggle through hardship made worse by environmental changes and economic injustice. Those memories are not separate from today’s climate crisis—they are part of it.

Fossil fuel extraction has scarred the places like the ones I grew up in. Communities have been pushed off their land. Forests and rivers have been polluted or destroyed. The damage is local and immediate, but it is also global. The carbon released from these projects does not stay in one place; it drives a changing climate that reaches far beyond Cameroon.

Now I live in Germany, and I see the impacts here too. Climate change is not only a distant problem affecting “somewhere else.” Floods, heatwaves and other extremes show that no country is truly safe. The same fossil fuel economy that uproots communities in Africa is heating the atmosphere over Europe. Our stories are connected.

This is why I believe so strongly that mothers, parents, and all who care about life must join the call for climate justice. We cannot protect our children while allowing fossil fuel companies to continue expanding into new oil, gas and coal projects. We cannot talk about a safe future while extraction continues to devastate communities and ecosystems.

The path forward is clear: fossil fuel companies must stop new projects and focus on repairing the damage they have already caused. Governments must stop siding with profit over people and instead stand with communities on the frontlines. And all of us, wherever we are, can add our voices to the demand for justice.

I carry my childhood in Cameroon with me. I carry the memory of forests and floods, of my mother’s strength and struggle. I carry my child in my arms and in my heart. These are the reasons I refuse to look away. The fight for climate and environmental justice is a fight for every child’s right to live, grow and dream—on a planet that is still alive, still beautiful, and still home.
