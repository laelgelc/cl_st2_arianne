The train rocks gently as it glides out of the station, steel and concrete blurring into the green of Vancouver’s trees. Across from me, a bright ad catches my eye: a simple image of a smiling family, paired with a message about family planning as a climate solution. It feels strangely out of place among the usual pitches for phones, condos, and streaming services. But in a way, it also feels like the most honest thing on this skytrain.

The ad brings to mind Vaclav Smil’s book *Growth*, which traces how expansion—of population, energy use, material throughput, and GDP—has shaped the modern world. Smil’s core message is blunt: nothing in nature grows forever. In the biosphere, every organism, every system, every process hits limits. It matures, stabilizes, or collapses. Our economic system, however, is built on the expectation of endless growth on a finite planet.

This contradiction is no longer abstract. It shows up as climate change, biodiversity loss, soil degradation, and collapsing fish stocks. We are pushing the Earth beyond its capacity to cope. Smil’s work underlines that this isn’t just a matter of inefficient technology or bad policy; it is fundamentally about scale. Humanity’s sheer size—our numbers, our consumption, our infrastructure—has become the central driver of ecological breakdown.

Even when we try to fix things, we often make them worse. Efficiency is a perfect example. We celebrate more efficient cars, appliances, and factories as victories for the climate. But Smil and many others point out the rebound effect: when something becomes more efficient and cheaper to use, we often use more of it. More efficient cars can lead to more driving. Cheaper electricity can lead to more devices, bigger homes, and higher overall consumption. Instead of reducing our total impact, efficiency gains can simply shift and expand it.

This is why the comforting story of “green growth” is so dangerous. The idea suggests we can keep growing the economy while shrinking our environmental footprint, simply by swapping fossil fuels for renewables and making everything more efficient. But if growth remains the unquestioned goal, any savings from new technologies risk being swallowed by more production, more consumption, and more extraction. The scale problem doesn’t go away; it just gets repackaged.

On the skytrain, surrounded by ads that quietly assume more—more stuff, more travel, more luxury—the family planning poster feels like a rare acknowledgment of limits. It points toward a different conversation: not just how we produce, but how much we produce; not just how we live, but how many of us there are, and at what level of material demand.

Addressing human scale means facing both consumption and population. On the consumption side, it means reducing waste and downsizing lifestyles, especially in high-income societies where per-person resource use and emissions are highest. It means asking what a good life looks like within planetary boundaries, and recognizing that endless accumulation is not the same as well-being.

On the population side, it means supporting the rights and choices of women and girls. Expanding access to contraception, education, and healthcare is essential—not as a top-down mandate, but as a matter of justice and autonomy. When women have the power to decide if and when to have children, family sizes tend to stabilize or decline. Linking this to climate and ecological limits doesn’t diminish those rights; it underscores how deeply human dignity and planetary health are intertwined.

The combination of smaller footprints per person and a stable or gradually declining global population is one of the clearest pathways out of ecological overshoot. But it requires something our current system resists: an end to the pursuit of perpetual growth for its own sake.

Ending growth does not mean ending progress. It means shifting our goals from “more” to “enough”—from expanding throughput to restoring ecosystems, strengthening communities, and ensuring that everyone’s basic needs are met within the Earth’s limits. It means redesigning systems so that success is measured in resilience, health, and fairness, not just in rising GDP.

As the train pulls into the next station, people step on and off, each carrying their own dreams and worries. The skyline in the distance is a monument to growth, but also a reminder of what’s at stake. We are living through the consequences of a civilization that has treated the biosphere as infinite. Smil’s work, and that quiet ad on the skytrain, both point to the same uncomfortable truth: we cannot solve our crises without confronting scale.

Escaping ecological overshoot will not come from efficiency tweaks or green branding. It demands systemic change—reducing wasteful consumption, reshaping our economies around limits, and ensuring that everyone has the rights and tools, including contraception, to make informed choices about their lives and families.

On a crowded train in a growing city, that can feel like a distant horizon. But acknowledging that endless growth is incompatible with a finite Earth is a necessary first step. From there, the real work begins: building a world that thrives within the boundaries of the only home we have.
