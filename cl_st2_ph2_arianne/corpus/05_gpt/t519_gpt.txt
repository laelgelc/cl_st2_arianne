Four years after Angela Merkel pledged that Germany would cut its greenhouse gas emissions by 40% by 2020 at the Paris Climate Agreement, three organic farming families have taken an unprecedented step: they are suing the German government for failing to act on its own climate promises.

This case marks the first time the federal government is being forced to defend its climate inaction in court. It comes at a moment when Germany has effectively abandoned its 2020 climate targets, even as temperatures continue to rise and the impacts of the climate crisis are increasingly visible in fields, orchards, and coastal farms.

For the Blohm family, who grow organic fruit, climate change is no longer an abstract threat. Warmer temperatures and shifting weather patterns have reduced their apple yields and brought new waves of pests into their orchards. The situation has become so severe that they have had to remove cherry trees that can no longer cope with the changing conditions.

On the Lütke Schwienhorst farm, prolonged droughts are putting the entire business at risk. What used to be reliable growing seasons are now marked by extended dry spells, stressing crops and undermining the stability that organic farms need to survive. The climate crisis is turning what should be manageable seasonal variation into a constant threat to their livelihoods.

Out on the coast, the Backsen family is facing the slow but relentless rise of the sea. Their island farm, passed down through generations, is now endangered by rising sea levels. The future of their land—and the possibility of continuing to farm there—is increasingly uncertain as the waters creep higher.

These families are not only defending their own farms; they are standing up for everyone whose lives and work are being destabilized by the climate crisis. By taking the government to court, they are demanding that Germany be held to the commitments it made and that real action replace empty promises.

Supporters are being urged to stand with these families and to join the calls for accountability. The case is about more than legal arguments—it is about insisting that those in power do not walk away from their responsibilities while farmers, communities, and ecosystems bear the cost of inaction.
