Air pollution from fossil fuels is a public health emergency. Every year, an estimated 4.5 million people around the world die because of the toxic air created when coal, oil, and gas are burned. While families and communities pay with their health and their lives, coal, oil, and car companies continue to profit from the very fuels that drive this crisis.

The same fossil fuels poisoning the air are also heating the planet. As coal is burned for electricity, oil is refined and used in transport, and gas is burned in homes and industry, more greenhouse gases are released into the atmosphere. This makes storms stronger, heatwaves longer, and droughts more severe, compounding the injustice faced by people already breathing unsafe air. Yet many companies and governments still delay decisive action, offering promises instead of the rapid transition away from fossil fuels that science and justice demand.

Around the world, communities are refusing to accept this situation as normal. In Thailand, people came together in 2019 to crowdfund solar installations for seven hospitals. These hospitals now rely less on fossil fuels for their electricity, demonstrating how clean energy can protect both patients’ health and the climate. The project shows what is possible when communities pool their resources and insist on solutions that put people, not polluters, first.

In Jakarta, 31 citizens decided to take their government to court over the city’s dangerous air pollution. Their lawsuit sparked a wave of public support, including petitions calling for cleaner air. Under this pressure, the governor made promises to tackle air pollution, showing how legal action and public mobilization can force authorities to respond to people’s right to breathe clean air.

In Belgium, a mother worried about the air her children were breathing at school started monitoring pollution levels outside the building. Her initiative revealed how serious the problem was and inspired action far beyond a single classroom. Schools across the country began closing streets around their buildings to traffic at certain times, reducing children’s exposure to toxic exhaust. The movement grew so strong that clean air became a key issue in elections, proving how one person’s determination can help shift national debates.

These stories send a clear message: change happens when people act together. Air pollution from fossil fuels is not inevitable; it is the result of political choices and corporate decisions. Communities are already showing what it looks like to choose health, safety, and a livable climate instead.

Everyone has a role to play. Signing petitions demanding clean air and a rapid phase-out of fossil fuels helps build visible, undeniable public pressure. Organizing local events—whether it is a community meeting, a street action, a school project, or a public discussion—brings people together and turns concern into collective power.

By standing with communities on the frontlines of air pollution and climate change, and by taking action where we live, we can challenge the power of fossil fuel interests and push governments to protect what truly matters: our health, our children’s futures, and the stability of our climate.
