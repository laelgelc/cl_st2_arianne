3M’s new global sustainable paper policy marks a significant shift in how one of the world’s most recognizable manufacturers sources the fiber behind its countless paper-based products. This change did not happen in a vacuum. It follows sustained campaigning by ForestEthics and Greenpeace to push 3M to stop contributing to forest destruction and human rights abuses through its supply chains.

At the heart of the policy is a clear commitment to keep 3M’s paper purchases away from some of the most ecologically and socially important places on the planet. The company has pledged not to buy paper from operations that threaten High Conservation Value Forests, Intact Forest Landscapes, or High Carbon Stock areas. These are the forests that store vast amounts of carbon, provide critical habitat for wildlife, and sustain communities and cultures. By drawing a line around these areas, 3M is acknowledging that some forests are simply too valuable to be turned into paper.

The policy also sets out social safeguards. 3M now requires that suppliers obtain Free, Prior and Informed Consent from indigenous communities whose lands or rights could be affected by forestry or plantation operations. This is a basic standard of respect: communities must be fully informed, consulted in advance, and able to say yes or no without coercion. In addition, the company is requiring respect for core worker rights, including a ban on forced and child labor and respect for workers’ freedom to organize and join unions. These commitments are designed to reduce the risk that 3M’s paper purchases are linked to exploitation, violence, or displacement.

Beyond where its fiber comes from, 3M is also addressing how much it uses and what kinds of materials go into its products. The policy includes goals to increase the use of recycled and tree-free paper, while reducing overall paper consumption. Shifting toward recycled content and alternative fibers can ease pressure on forests, and using less paper overall is one of the most direct ways to reduce environmental impact.

Transparency is another important pillar. 3M has committed to providing public performance reports on its implementation of the policy, working with The Forest Trust. Public reporting creates a mechanism for accountability: it allows customers, NGOs, and the public to track whether the company is living up to its promises and to identify where further improvements are needed.

Crucially, the policy is already reshaping 3M’s supplier relationships. The company has cut ties with a subsidiary of Royal Golden Eagle (RGE) that was linked to APRIL’s rainforest destruction in Indonesia. This step responds to evidence of large-scale habitat degradation and conflicts with indigenous communities connected to those operations. By ending this business relationship, 3M is sending a market signal that destroying rainforests and trampling community rights is unacceptable.

3M has also warned Resolute Forest Products that it must comply with the new policy or risk losing 3M’s business. This warning directly addresses ongoing concerns, including habitat degradation and conflicts with indigenous peoples linked to some of Resolute’s operations. If 3M follows through, it would reinforce the message that access to major global customers now depends on respecting forests and rights.

This policy is the result of persistent advocacy by ForestEthics and Greenpeace and shows how pressure from civil society can push large corporations to change. By setting restrictions on sourcing, embedding community and labor rights, promoting recycled and tree-free materials, reducing consumption, and committing to public reporting, 3M is beginning to align its paper supply chains with the protection of forests and the people who depend on them.
