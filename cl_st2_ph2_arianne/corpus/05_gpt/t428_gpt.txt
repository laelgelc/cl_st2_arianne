Lagi Toribau looks back at 2020 as a year that laid bare how deeply our global systems are failing people and the planet. For him, the crises of this year have made it impossible to ignore that the dominant model driving our world is built on competition, power, and inequality, rather than collaboration, care, and the value of human life.

He contrasts this with the communal structures that shaped his upbringing in Fiji. Growing up in a context where community, shared responsibility, and mutual support were everyday realities, he sees clearly that other ways of living and organizing society are possible. That experience informs his belief that genuine transformation has to start with a change in mindset: how we see each other, how we measure success, and what we choose to value.

From this perspective, he imagines a world where people are not boxed in by biases and rigid labels, and where competition is no longer the driving force of our relationships and institutions. In this vision, happiness and health become the true currencies that define wellbeing and progress. Humans live in harmony with nature rather than exploiting it, recognizing that our survival and flourishing are inseparable from the health of the ecosystems around us.

The COVID-19 pandemic, for Toribau, has exposed how fragile and unjust our current systems really are. It has revealed the vulnerabilities built into structures that prioritize profit and power over people’s lives and the environment. He argues that this moment demands a fundamental rethinking of what security means: expanding it beyond narrow economic or national definitions to include equity, public health, and strong environmental protection.

Alongside the pandemic, 2020 was also marked by a global reckoning with systemic racism. Toribau is deeply affected by the murder of George Floyd and the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement, seeing them as stark reminders of how violence and injustice are embedded in existing power structures. He underscores that dismantling systemic racism is not only a matter for institutions and governments; it also depends on the choices individuals make every day.

For him, the path forward lies in consciously choosing justice, solidarity, and care—rejecting the norms of competition and domination that have brought the world to this breaking point. By changing our mindsets and our daily decisions, he believes we can help build a future where everyone’s happiness and health matter, and where humanity finally learns to live in balance with nature.
