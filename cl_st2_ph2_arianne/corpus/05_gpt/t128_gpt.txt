Greenpeace Argentina continues to mobilize against offshore oil development in the Argentine Sea, warning of serious risks to marine ecosystems, coastal economies and environmental rights. The campaign focuses on the overlap between planned oil operations and critical habitats for protected species, including the Southern Right Whale, a symbol of Argentina’s marine biodiversity and a key part of coastal tourism and local livelihoods.

In response to strong public opposition and legal challenges, a precautionary measure had been granted to suspend offshore activities. However, a recent government resolution approved Equinor’s Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), reopening the door for exploration in areas of the Argentine Sea. This decision was taken despite the existing precautionary measure and in clear violation of the Escazú Agreement, which guarantees access to information, public participation and justice in environmental matters. The approval process failed to respect these principles, sidelining communities and organizations that have been demanding a transparent, participatory evaluation of the project’s risks.

Greenpeace Argentina has formally submitted a letter demanding the annulment of the resolution that approved Equinor’s EIA. The organization argues that the decision disregards both national and international environmental commitments, and that it undermines the rights of coastal communities, Indigenous peoples, scientists and civil society to participate meaningfully in decisions that affect the ocean and climate.

While the legal and administrative battle continues, so does social mobilization. Across coastal cities and beyond, people are taking to the streets in the #Atlanticazo demonstrations, a wave of protests uniting fishers, tourism workers, youth, scientists, artists and activists. Together, they are calling for the protection of the Argentine Sea from seismic exploration and offshore drilling, and for a development model that prioritizes renewable energy, healthy oceans and climate justice.

Greenpeace points to Equinor’s track record to underscore the dangers of expanding offshore oil in the region. The company’s history of oil spills and leaks in Norway and Brazil is a stark warning of what could happen in the Argentine Sea. Seismic exploration alone poses serious threats to marine life through intense underwater noise, which can disrupt feeding, breeding and migration of whales, dolphins and many other species. A spill in these waters would be catastrophic, with long‑lasting impacts on biodiversity, fisheries, tourism and coastal communities that depend on a clean and thriving ocean.

Allowing offshore oil development to advance in the Argentine Sea not only risks ecological devastation, it also deepens economic vulnerability by tying local livelihoods to a polluting and unstable industry. Greenpeace Argentina is calling on authorities to respect the Escazú Agreement, revoke the approval of Equinor’s Environmental Impact Assessment, and commit to protecting the ocean as a shared heritage—essential for biodiversity, for people and for confronting the climate crisis.
