Nate Hagens’ story is, in many ways, a story about waking up to limits.

After a successful career as a Wall Street executive, he stepped away from high finance and turned his attention to a very different kind of balance sheet: the physical and ecological foundations of the global economy. That shift led him into the study of energy limits and, eventually, to founding the Institute for the Study of Energy & Our Future, an organization focused on understanding how energy, ecology, and the economy are intertwined.

Through his work, Hagens has become a prominent voice on what he calls our “ecological predicaments.” He hosts conversations with scientists, thinkers, and practitioners on his podcast, The Great Simplification, exploring how energy, environment, and society are connected—and what happens when those connections are strained by physical limits.

At the heart of Hagens’ message is the concept of “The Great Simplification.” He uses this term to describe an impending reversal of the complexity that has defined modern industrial society. For decades, abundant fossil energy—especially with a high energy surplus—has underpinned expanding global systems: intricate supply chains, sprawling financial markets, rapid technological change, and rising consumption.

Hagens argues that this era of ever-increasing complexity is colliding with several hard constraints. As the surplus energy from fossil fuels declines, economies become more fragile. At the same time, rising levels of debt and mounting environmental pressures are pushing the system further out on a limb. In his view, these trends point toward a future where our societies will be forced to simplify—whether we are prepared for it or not.

A central theme in his work is what he calls “energy blindness.” Modern societies, he suggests, tend to overlook the fundamental role energy plays in everything from food and transport to information systems and healthcare. We see money and technology, but often ignore the physical energy flows that make them possible. This blindness makes it easier to believe that our current way of living can continue indefinitely, even as the underlying energy conditions change.

Hagens also challenges the assumption that renewable energy can seamlessly replace fossil fuels at the scale and speed needed to maintain today’s level of societal complexity. While renewables are expanding and are a critical part of any climate and energy response, he stresses that they cannot fully replicate the role fossil fuels have played in building and sustaining the current global system.

In light of this, he advocates for responses that acknowledge limits and focus on reducing harm. Rather than betting everything on a like-for-like energy substitution, Hagens emphasizes the importance of building local resiliency—stronger communities that are less dependent on long, fragile supply chains and ever-growing consumption. He encourages reduced material use and a shift in cultural values toward ecological awareness and responsibility.

For Hagens, preparing for The Great Simplification is not about giving up; it is about facing reality as it is, rather than as we wish it to be. By recognizing energy limits, questioning assumptions about endless growth, and nurturing more resilient, ecologically grounded ways of living, he believes we can soften the landing in a world where complexity, as we’ve known it, cannot continue expanding forever.
