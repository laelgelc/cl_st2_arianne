In 2013, as world leaders gathered in Warsaw for COP19, Super Typhoon Haiyan tore through the Philippines with terrifying force. While governments debated climate texts inside the conference halls, entire communities back home were being torn apart. Yeb Saño, then the Philippines’ climate negotiator, watched the news in anguish, knowing his own brother was in the path of the storm.

His brother survived. Thousands of others did not.

Haiyan was a brutal reminder that climate change is not an abstract future threat; it is a present-day emergency. For Saño, it was also deeply personal. As a parent, he looks at the world his children are growing up in and sees climate disasters becoming more frequent and more intense, driven by the continued burning of fossil fuels. The fear is no longer just about what might happen decades from now, but about what is already unfolding.

Amid this escalating crisis, Saño points to the responsibility of major fossil fuel companies. He highlights Shell in particular, noting that Shell’s carbon pollution is enormous—ten times greater than that of the Philippines. While vulnerable countries are battered by storms, floods, and rising seas, companies like Shell continue to profit from activities that fuel the climate crisis.

In 2022, Shell reported record profits. Saño contrasts those profits with the human and economic toll of climate disasters, pointing out that Shell’s 2022 earnings exceeded the estimated costs of cleaning up from Pakistan’s devastating floods. For him, this is not just a matter of numbers; it is a stark illustration of climate injustice. Communities who have contributed the least to climate change are paying the highest price, while those most responsible continue to benefit.

This is why Saño insists that Shell must pay for loss and damage—the irreversible harms caused by climate change that cannot be adapted to or avoided. He connects the dots between corporate emissions, extreme weather, and the shattered lives left in their wake. Accountability, in his view, means that big polluters must contribute financially to repairing the damage they have helped cause.

At COP27, after years of pressure from vulnerable countries and civil society, governments agreed to establish a loss and damage fund. For Saño, this was a critical step toward justice—an acknowledgment that the world’s most affected communities deserve support, and that the global system must begin to address the real costs of climate breakdown. But a fund on paper is only the beginning. The question of who pays, and how much, remains central.

Saño has taken his fight beyond the negotiation halls. He joined Greenpeace activists in a direct action targeting a Shell oil platform in the North Sea, aiming to disrupt business-as-usual and shine a spotlight on the company’s role in driving the climate crisis. By confronting the physical infrastructure of fossil fuel extraction, the activists sought to send a clear message: it is time to stop expanding fossil fuel production and start holding big polluters accountable for the harm their products cause around the world.

For Saño, standing on that platform was a continuation of the same struggle that began in the halls of COP19 as Haiyan raged at home. It was an act rooted in the memory of lives lost, the fear of what lies ahead for his children, and the conviction that companies like Shell must be made to answer for their role in the climate emergency.
