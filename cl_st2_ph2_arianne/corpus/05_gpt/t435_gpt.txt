When COVID-19 hit southern Thailand, it didn’t just bring a public health crisis. For small-scale fishers, it meant shuttered markets, collapsing seafood prices, and a sudden loss of income. Boats still went out, nets were still cast, but the usual buyers were gone and the value of their catch plummeted.

Faced with this reality, Wichotsak Ronarongpairee, chairman of the Thai Sea Watch Association (TSWA), looked for a way to support both the fishers and the wider community. He created a simple but powerful initiative: a fund where each 150 THB donation would be used to buy seafood directly from local fishers. That seafood was then distributed to people in need, including communities such as the blind and medical staff working through the pandemic.

The response was significant. The fund raised nearly 60,000 THB, enough to purchase and deliver around a ton of fish. More than 500 care workers received this seafood, and they expressed their gratitude for the support during a difficult time. The effort not only provided much-needed food and recognition to those on the front lines, it also helped keep small-scale fishers afloat when conventional markets had failed them.

Looking ahead, Ronarongpairee expects that direct online sales from fishers to consumers will grow. This shift could connect people more closely with fresh, traditionally caught seafood, while offering fishers a more resilient way to sell their catch.

Building on the experience of the first fund, TSWA is already planning another program. This next step will focus on supporting those who are especially vulnerable: the poor, the homeless, and people with disabilities.
