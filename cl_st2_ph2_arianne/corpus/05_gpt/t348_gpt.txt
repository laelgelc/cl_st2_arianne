Polish climate activists who joined Fridays for Future demonstrations during the December European Council summit are now facing serious legal consequences for using megaphones to demand higher EU 2030 greenhouse gas reduction targets. At least five of those accused are over 18 and are being charged with breaking environmental law for their role in the protests.

Underage participants have been assigned special guardians by the authorities. Some of them have experienced police officers arriving at their homes, being summoned to court, and having probation officers check on them. Activists describe the situation as stressful and uncertain, and they see these actions as a form of repression that goes far beyond the peaceful nature of their climate protests.

The potential consequences are severe. Young people involved in the demonstrations are being confronted with the possibility of being sent to a reform school, a punishment that activists view as completely disproportionate to the act of using megaphones at a climate march.

Those targeted say their experience reflects a broader pattern of intimidation in Poland, a country heavily dependent on coal and suffering from high levels of air pollution that contribute to premature deaths. In response, the activists are preparing to appeal to foreign embassies for support. They want to draw international attention to the pressure they are facing for demanding stronger climate action and higher EU greenhouse gas reduction targets for 2030.
