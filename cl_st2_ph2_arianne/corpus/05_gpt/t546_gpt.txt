Twenty-two Greenpeace USA activists have taken peaceful but dramatic action in Baytown, Texas, suspending themselves from the Fred Hartman Bridge to shut down the busiest oil shipping channel in the United States. Their plan is to remain in place for 24 hours, directly confronting the fossil fuel industry at a chokepoint that normally moves over 700,000 barrels of oil every day, with capacity projected to rise to 2 million barrels daily.

This bold action is designed to match the scale and urgency of the climate crisis. The activists’ bright banners and dangling lines against the backdrop of tankers and refineries make the stakes visible: continued expansion of fossil fuel infrastructure is incompatible with a safe, livable future. Dramatic footage from the scene underscores a simple message—business as usual is a choice, and it can be interrupted.

One of the activists, Irene Kim, spoke to the heart of why they are risking arrest and personal safety. She emphasized that the climate emergency is already here, and that communities—especially those living near refineries, ports, and petrochemical facilities—are already suffering the consequences of fossil fuel extraction, transport, and burning. From toxic air and water to climate-fueled storms and floods, the burden is falling first and worst on those least responsible for the crisis.

Kim called for bold leadership and systemic change, insisting that tinkering at the margins is no longer enough. Ending the era of fossil fuels requires a fundamental shift in how we power our lives and economies, and it demands elected officials willing to stand up to the oil and gas industry rather than doing its bidding.

This action comes as Democratic presidential candidates gather in Houston for a televised debate. Greenpeace is using this moment to press every candidate on stage to choose a side: support a Green New Deal and a rapid, just transition away from fossil fuels, or continue to allow the industry to drive policy and lock in decades more climate chaos.

The demand is clear. Candidates must:

- Publicly support a Green New Deal-scale transformation of the U.S. economy, centered on climate science, justice, and good jobs.
- Reject fossil fuel money and influence, and commit to policies that phase out oil, gas, and coal production in line with what science and justice require.

The activists hanging from the Fred Hartman Bridge are making visible what is usually hidden: the constant flow of oil that underpins the climate crisis. By stopping that flow, even temporarily, they are forcing a conversation that can’t be postponed any longer. Their message to those on the debate stage in Houston—and to political leaders everywhere—is that real courage means standing up to the fossil fuel industry and choosing a just, renewable future instead.
