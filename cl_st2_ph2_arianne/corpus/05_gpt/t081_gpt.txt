Indigenous Peoples represent less than 5% of the world’s population, yet they safeguard 80% of the planet’s remaining biodiversity. This reality stands in stark contrast to the daily violations of their rights and their exclusion from the very decisions that shape the future of their lands, waters and territories.

At COP15, Indigenous leaders from different regions are bringing this contradiction into sharp focus and calling for a fundamental shift in how global biodiversity is protected.

From the Democratic Republic of Congo, Valentin Engobo highlights how community forestry is central to protecting forests and the people who depend on them. He points to the discovery of vast peatlands that store enormous amounts of carbon, underscoring how Indigenous-led protection of these ecosystems is critical not only for biodiversity, but also for stabilizing the climate. Yet, despite this, the communities who have long cared for these areas are often sidelined when decisions are made.

In West Papua, Orpha is confronting the expansion of oil palm plantations that are clearing forests without the free, prior and informed consent of Indigenous communities. These plantations destroy forests, threaten biodiversity and undermine the rights and livelihoods of the people whose territories are being taken. Her struggle is a clear example of how industrial expansion is enabled when Indigenous voices are ignored.

In Canada, Adrienne Jerome is advocating for the protection of caribou, a species deeply connected to Indigenous cultures and ways of life. Caribou populations are under severe pressure from industrial activities that fragment and degrade their habitat. Adrienne’s work exposes how these industrial threats are allowed to advance while Indigenous knowledge and leadership, which are essential for effective species protection, are not properly recognized or respected.

From Brazil, Dinamam Tuxá denounces policies that dispossess Indigenous Peoples of their territories. Such policies not only violate fundamental rights, they also open the door to deforestation, ecosystem destruction and further biodiversity loss. His message makes clear that when Indigenous territories are weakened or taken away, nature is put at risk.

Together, these voices are united in a call for COP15 to abandon colonial conservation models that exclude or displace Indigenous Peoples in the name of “protecting” nature. These models have a long history of violating rights, erasing knowledge, and failing to stop biodiversity loss.

Instead, they urge governments and institutions at COP15 to ensure the meaningful participation of Indigenous Peoples in all decisions affecting their lands and territories, and to fully recognize and uphold their rights. Only by centering Indigenous leadership, knowledge and authority can biodiversity protection be effective, just and lasting.
