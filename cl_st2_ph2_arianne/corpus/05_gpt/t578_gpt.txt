Far below the ocean’s surface, in a world of darkness and crushing pressure, life has evolved in strange and spectacular ways. Among the most mysterious places in this hidden realm are hydrothermal vents – otherworldly landscapes where mineral-rich fluids pour from the seafloor, feeding bizarre creatures that thrive without sunlight.

One of the most remarkable of these sites is the Lost City, discovered in 2000. Here, towering chimneys rise from the deep, built from minerals precipitating out of warm, alkaline fluids that seep from the ocean crust. Around these chimneys, unique life forms live in conditions that would be lethal to most known species. They depend not on photosynthesis, but on chemical reactions that turn inorganic compounds into energy and organic matter.

Scientists think that places like the Lost City might hold clues to one of the biggest questions we have: how life began on Earth. The chemical reactions happening at these vents can create hydrocarbons – key building blocks of life. Some researchers believe that similar environments in the early ocean could have sparked the first living systems on our planet. Yet, despite their importance, hydrothermal vents and their ecosystems remain poorly understood. We are only beginning to grasp how they function, how their communities are connected, and what they can teach us about life on Earth and possibly beyond.

At the same time, this fragile and largely unknown world is coming under threat. Deep-sea mining licenses are being pushed forward in international waters, targeting minerals found on and beneath the seafloor. The machinery and disruption from such operations could destroy hydrothermal vent fields like the Lost City before we have the chance to fully study them, wiping out unique habitats and species that may exist nowhere else.

To confront this emerging threat, Greenpeace’s Pole to Pole expedition has traveled to the Lost City. By bearing witness to this extraordinary place, the expedition is working to raise global awareness and build momentum for strong protections. The goal is clear: to ensure that sites like the Lost City are safeguarded from exploitation and preserved for science, for the ocean, and for future generations.

Public support is crucial. Protecting the deep ocean means standing against destructive deep-sea mining before it starts, and calling for vulnerable marine habitats to be placed off-limits to industrial activity. The more people who speak up, the better the chances of securing lasting protection for the deep – for its bizarre creatures, its ancient mysteries, and the irreplaceable clues it holds about the origins of life itself.
