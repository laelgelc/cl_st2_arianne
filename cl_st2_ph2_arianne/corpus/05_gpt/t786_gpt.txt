Penguins popped up in some surprising places this Penguin Awareness Day. People around the world spotted them ice skating through Stockholm, tap dancing across London, trekking over hills in Turkey, marching through the streets of Tokyo, roaming the deserts of Israel, and even swimming in the Dead Sea.

These playful scenes weren’t just for fun—they carried an urgent message. Every waddle, slide, and splash was a call to protect the Antarctic by creating a vast ocean sanctuary. This sanctuary would keep industrial fishing vessels out of some of the most important waters on Earth, especially those where krill are found.

Krill might be tiny, but they are absolutely essential for life in the Antarctic. Penguins, whales, and seals all depend on them for food. When industrial fishing fleets target krill, they threaten the entire Antarctic food web. By keeping these waters safe from industrial exploitation, an Antarctic ocean sanctuary would give penguins and many other species the space they need to feed, breed, and thrive.

Healthy oceans don’t just support wildlife. They help stabilize the climate and provide food security for billions of people around the world. Protecting the Antarctic is part of protecting the global ocean system we all rely on.

Everyone who smiled at the sight of penguins turning up in unexpected places is invited to be part of this effort. By joining the movement to safeguard their home, we can help ensure that penguins keep waddling—on ice, on land, and in our imaginations—forever.
