The concentration of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere continues to rise, and global greenhouse gas emissions keep breaking records year after year. Yet governments and corporations still refuse to act at the scale and speed the climate crisis demands. Instead of rapidly phasing out fossil fuels and building a renewable energy system, they are doubling down on some of the dirtiest and most destructive forms of oil.

Behind the reassuring rhetoric of “energy security” and “abundance” lies an uncomfortable reality: conventional oil production has already peaked, and what keeps overall oil supply growing is a surge in unconventional fossil fuels. These include tar sands bitumen, heavy oils, synthetic liquids, deepwater oil, biofuels, and fracked tight oil. Together, they create the illusion that there is no limit to oil, masking the decline in easier-to-extract conventional crude.

These unconventional sources are not a like‑for‑like replacement. They are generally lower‑quality and far more energy‑intensive to produce, refine, and transport. Extracting thick bitumen from tar sands, drilling in deep and fragile ocean waters, fracking tight oil from shale, or processing heavy oils into synthetic liquids all demand huge amounts of energy and resources. The result is a fuel system that is more polluting and more carbon‑intensive at precisely the moment we need to be cutting emissions as fast as possible.

The environmental damage from this rush into unconventional oil is profound. Tar sands mining and heavy oil operations scar landscapes, destroy ecosystems, and generate toxic waste. Deepwater drilling raises the risk of catastrophic spills in sensitive marine environments. Fracking and other unconventional techniques can contaminate water, release pollutants, and industrialise whole regions. Communities near extraction sites are exposed to increased health risks, while the global atmosphere absorbs the additional carbon burden.

Spills, air and water pollution, and the health impacts on people and wildlife are not side issues; they are built into the very nature of these fuels. Because they are harder to get at and more complex to process, they bring a higher likelihood of accidents and chronic contamination. At the same time, every new unconventional barrel locks in more long‑lived infrastructure—pipelines, refineries, export terminals—that is designed to operate for decades.

This expansion is being propped up financially as well. The push into unconventional oil is underpinned by growing debt and speculative, Ponzi‑like financial structures that depend on constant growth and ever‑rising production to stay afloat. Instead of channelling capital into clean energy, efficiency, and resilient communities, vast sums are sunk into projects that deepen dependence on fossil fuels and delay the inevitable transition.

All of this adds up to a dangerous form of climate denial in practice. By leaning on unconventional fossil fuels, political and corporate leaders can pretend that the world can carry on as usual—that we can keep burning oil indefinitely without confronting its limits or its climate impacts. This illusion delays investment in renewables, slows the deployment of clean technologies, and crowds out the policies needed to transform our energy systems.

Every year of delay means more carbon in the atmosphere, more extreme weather, more damage to lives and livelihoods. As CO2 levels climb and emissions hit new highs, the choice becomes starker: continue expanding low‑quality, destructive, and debt‑driven fossil fuel frontiers, or finally commit to a rapid, just transition away from oil and toward renewable energy.

Persisting with unconventional oil is a decision to deepen the climate crisis and to pass an even more unstable world to future generations. Ending this dangerous detour and accelerating the shift to clean energy is not just an environmental necessity—it is the only responsible path left.
