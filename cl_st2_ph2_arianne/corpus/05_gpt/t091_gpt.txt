In South Africa’s South Durban Industrial Basin, the polluted community of Wentworth shows how ecological damage and gender-based violence and femicide (GBVF) are deeply connected. The same systems that drive climate change and environmental destruction—rooted in patriarchal colonialism—also entrench violence, inequality, and poverty for womxn and girls.

Wentworth is surrounded by factories and refineries whose pollution poisons the air, land, and water. This environmental harm does not affect everyone equally. It compounds existing gender inequalities, making life more precarious for womxn and girls who already shoulder the burden of unpaid care, health impacts, and community survival in the face of crisis. Climate change, driven by these same destructive industries, intensifies these pressures and deepens social instability, creating conditions where GBVF can increase.

Employment in the South Durban Industrial Basin is largely male-dominated. This pattern reinforces economic disparities, limiting womxn’s access to decent work and income, and making it harder for them to leave abusive relationships or challenge harmful power dynamics. When industries profit while communities like Wentworth bear the costs of pollution, the result is a cycle of environmental injustice and gendered violence that keeps womxn and girls at heightened risk.

The link between ecological damage and GBVF in Wentworth shows why responses cannot be siloed. Tackling GBVF without addressing the toxic, climate-destabilising industries that shape daily life in the South Durban Industrial Basin will leave the root causes of harm intact. Likewise, climate and environmental policies that ignore gendered impacts risk reinforcing the very inequalities they should be dismantling.

An intersectional approach is needed—one that recognises how patriarchy, colonial legacies, environmental racism, and economic exploitation intersect in places like Wentworth. Integrating a just energy transition into GBVF policies is central to this. Moving away from polluting industries towards cleaner, community-centred energy systems can help transform the conditions that make womxn and girls vulnerable, while also redistributing power and resources.

Aligning GBVF strategies with just transition principles offers a pathway to advance the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in a meaningful way. It means centring the voices and experiences of those most affected by both ecological damage and gender-based violence, and committing to dismantle the systems of oppression that tie climate injustice to the everyday realities of womxn and girls in Wentworth and across South Africa.
