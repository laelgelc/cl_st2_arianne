Photographs can make us pause, look closer, and feel what words alone sometimes cannot convey. Around the world, photographers are using their cameras to document the realities of climate change as they unfold over years, not just in single, dramatic moments. Through long-term projects, they are building visual records of places under pressure and communities adapting in real time.

In the Sundarbans, photographer Swastik Pal follows the lives of islanders who are on the frontlines of rising seas. Their homes and fields are threatened by encroaching saltwater, repeated floods, and the constant risk of displacement. His work does not stop at showing loss; it also highlights the resilience of people who continue to rebuild, adapt, and hold on to their way of life despite the mounting challenges.

Further west, Nadia Bseiso turns her lens toward the Fertile Crescent, a region long known for its abundance and agricultural history. Today, water scarcity and prolonged droughts are reshaping this landscape and calling its famed fertility into question. Her images explore what it means for a cradle of civilization to face a future where water is no longer guaranteed, and they call for greater awareness of how deeply water security is tied to culture, stability, and survival.

In Mozambique, Amilton Neves documents the country’s timber industry and the deforestation it drives, as well as the impacts of increasingly destructive cyclones. Forests fall to logging, while storms grow more intense, leaving communities and ecosystems more exposed. By focusing on these intertwined crises, his work aims to encourage preservation and a rethinking of how natural resources are used and protected.

In Jakarta, one of the world’s fastest-sinking cities, Agoes Rudianto records the daily reality of land subsidence and flooding. As the ground sinks and waters rise, residents face frequent inundation. His photographs show both the damage and the adaptations, from makeshift protections to large-scale constructions like sea walls, capturing a city struggling to stay above water.

Taken together, these long-term projects go beyond single headlines or isolated disasters. They build deeper environmental narratives that connect climate impacts to people’s lives, histories, and futures. By bearing witness over time, these photographers help create the awareness that is essential for meaningful action on the climate crisis.
