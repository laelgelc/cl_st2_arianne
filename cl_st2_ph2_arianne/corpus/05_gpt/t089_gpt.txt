Thai mackerel has long been a staple on Thai tables – affordable, filling, and central to dishes like mackerel chili paste that many families rely on. But in just a few years, this once-abundant fish has become harder to find, more expensive, and increasingly out of reach for low-income households.

The root of the crisis lies in unregulated overfishing of juvenile mackerel. Instead of allowing young fish to grow and reproduce, they are being caught before they reach maturity. The impact has been stark: by 2020, catches of Thai mackerel had plummeted to just one-tenth of what they were in 2014. The fish that do reach the market are often smaller, sometimes imported rather than locally caught, and sold at higher prices. For many people, especially the poor who depend on mackerel as a key, affordable source of protein, this is not just an environmental issue – it is a direct threat to food security.

Local fishers, who have seen these changes unfold in their own nets, are at the forefront of efforts to reverse this decline. From 23 provinces across Thailand, they have come together to campaign against the catching of juvenile mackerel. Their demands are simple but powerful: stop fishing young mackerel, protect their nursery areas, and ensure that future generations can still rely on this vital species.

In their communities, these fishers have begun to establish nurseries to safeguard young mackerel and give the population a chance to recover. They have also turned their attention to the marketplace, calling on supermarkets to stop selling juvenile fish and to play their part in ending destructive practices that undermine both marine ecosystems and coastal livelihoods.

To carry their message from the coast to the heart of political power, the fishers organized the “Reclaim Mackerel Chili Paste” voyage. On World Oceans Day, they set sail from Pattani in southern Thailand and travelled more than 1,000 kilometres by sea to Bangkok, heading directly to the national parliament. This journey was not only a physical feat but a powerful symbol: a reminder that decisions made in the capital have profound consequences for the oceans and for the people who depend on them.

Their key demand was the enforcement of Section 57 of the Fisheries Act. This legal provision, if properly implemented, could help curb destructive fishing practices and protect juvenile mackerel. By invoking this law, the fishers were not asking for new promises, but for existing rules to be respected and applied.

The voyage captured significant media attention, helping to raise public awareness of the crisis facing Thai mackerel and the communities that rely on them. In response to this pressure, the government issued a promise to act. Yet despite this commitment, no concrete measures have followed. Faced with continued inaction, the fishers and their allies have now issued a 60-day ultimatum, signalling that they will not quietly accept the loss of a species so central to their culture, diets, and livelihoods.

The struggle to save Thai mackerel is about more than a single fish. It is about the right of coastal communities to sustain themselves, the responsibility of authorities to enforce existing laws, and the urgent need to shift away from short-sighted exploitation toward practices that respect both the ocean and the people who depend on it.
