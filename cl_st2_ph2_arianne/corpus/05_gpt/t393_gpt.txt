Every year, the International Day of Awareness of Food Loss and Waste is a stark reminder of a profound contradiction in our food system: more than 30% of all food produced globally is lost or wasted, while hunger is on the rise. In 2019, around 690 million people were hungry. Since then, the COVID-19 pandemic has deepened this injustice, exposing how fragile and unequal our food system really is.

The pandemic’s impacts – from labour shortages on farms and in processing plants, to restrictions on transport and market access, to the broader economic crisis – have made it harder for many people to get enough to eat. At the same time, huge quantities of food continue to be discarded at every step from farm to fork. This is not just a moral failure; it is also an environmental disaster.

Producing food that is never eaten drives deforestation as forests are cleared for cropland and pasture. It drains rivers and aquifers through unnecessary water use. It squanders energy and agrochemicals. Food loss and waste are responsible for around 8% of global greenhouse gas emissions, worsening the climate crisis that in turn threatens future harvests and food security.

These problems are deeply rooted in the current industrial food system. Long, complex supply chains mean food travels great distances, passing through multiple intermediaries before it reaches people’s plates. Along the way, it is vulnerable to spoilage, rejection, and waste. The push to keep food prices artificially low, often at the expense of farmers and workers, encourages overproduction and a throwaway culture, rather than valuing food as something precious and hard-won.

Addressing food loss and waste requires action at every level. Individuals can make a real difference through everyday choices: planning meals, storing food properly, using leftovers creatively, and buying locally produced food where possible. Shorter supply chains can cut down on waste and help keep more value in local communities.

But personal action alone is not enough. Systemic change is essential. Relocalizing food production can reduce transport distances and the number of steps where food can be lost. Ensuring fair prices for farmers and food workers can shift incentives away from overproduction and towards quality, resilience, and care for land and people. Supporting ecological farming practices can protect soils, water, biodiversity, and the climate while producing healthy food.

The 2021 UN Food System Summit is a crucial opportunity to push for this transformation. It must be a moment to move away from a wasteful, extractive model and towards food systems rooted in justice and sovereignty – where communities have real power over how their food is produced, distributed, and consumed. Reducing food loss and waste is not just about saving resources; it is about reshaping our entire relationship with food so that everyone can eat with dignity, and the planet can thrive.
