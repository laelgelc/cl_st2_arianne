The footage of Ari’s burial at sea is harrowing. Wrapped in cloth, his body is lowered into the water from the deck of a fishing vessel, a stark and final act for a 24-year-old Indonesian migrant fisher whose life ended far from home. Ari was working on a Chinese-owned vessel operated by Dalian Ocean Fishing when he died, one of four fishers from the same fleet who lost their lives after suffering poor treatment on board.

This story first came to light when South Korean broadcaster MBC exposed the case, and the video quickly spread online. As it circulated, more reports emerged: additional deaths, desperate pleas for rescue, and testimonies of abuse from fishers trapped at sea. What was once hidden in the middle of the ocean is now being forced into public view.

Mobile phones have been central to this shift. Fishers are increasingly using their devices to record and share what is happening on board distant-water fishing vessels. Through videos, photos, and messages, they have been able to document mistreatment, forced labor, and human trafficking, as well as illegal practices such as shark finning. These abuses and crimes have long been uncovered and exposed by Greenpeace, but the ability of workers themselves to capture direct evidence at sea is changing how quickly and powerfully these stories reach the world.

Behind the images and reports lies a broader pattern of exploitation. Indonesian migrant fishers, like Ari, are often recruited into dangerous working conditions with few protections. Once at sea, they can be isolated for months or even years, with limited communication and almost no recourse if their rights are violated. The deaths on Dalian Ocean Fishing’s vessels, and the testimonies that followed, are part of this wider reality.

Despite years of evidence and warnings, the Indonesian government has largely ignored the problem of modern slavery in its distant-water fishing workforce. Only recently, in the wake of public outrage and viral exposure, has it taken some reactive steps. These responses, however, remain far from the comprehensive action needed to protect its citizens.

For real change, the Indonesian government must go beyond short-term or symbolic measures. It needs to ensure that recruitment agencies, fishing companies, and fleets are held fully accountable for the treatment of workers on their vessels. This requires stronger monitoring systems that can track where fishers are sent, under what conditions they work, and what happens to them at sea.

The evidence is already there—in the videos of burials, in the messages sent from ships, and in the investigations that have documented forced labor, human trafficking, and illegal fishing practices. The question now is whether those with the power to act will finally listen, and whether the deaths of fishers like Ari will lead to the protections that so many others urgently need.
