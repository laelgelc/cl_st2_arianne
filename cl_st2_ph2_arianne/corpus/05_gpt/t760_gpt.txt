Jennifer Morgan and Bunny McDiarmid, Executive Directors of Greenpeace International, have been deeply inspired by the courage and solidarity of the #MeToo movement. The voices of people speaking out about harassment and abuse have underscored, for them and for Greenpeace, how essential it is to have robust systems and an inclusive culture that make every workplace genuinely safe.

In response, Greenpeace has adopted a global Integrity Package designed to strengthen how the organisation prevents and responds to harm. This package includes a Code of Conduct that sets clear expectations for behaviour, as well as complaint protocols that guide how concerns are raised, handled and resolved. Offices across the Greenpeace network are upgrading their internal processes to align with this global framework, and there are plans for annual reporting on complaints to increase transparency and accountability.

Creating a culture of equity and empowerment is at the heart of this effort. Greenpeace is working to ensure that staff and others connected to the organisation have access to training, to trusted officers they can turn to, and to systems that support diversity and inclusion. The goal is not only to have policies on paper, but to build an environment where people feel safe, respected and able to speak up.

This work is seen as central to Greenpeace’s mission. The way people are treated within the organisation is inseparable from the broader struggle to protect the planet. For Greenpeace, defending human dignity and fostering inclusive, safe spaces is part of defending the Earth itself. At the same time, there is a clear recognition that this is an ongoing journey: improvements are still needed, and the organisation is committed to continuing to learn, adapt and strengthen its approach.
