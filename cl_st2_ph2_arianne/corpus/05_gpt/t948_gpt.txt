Illegal logging remains one of the most destructive forces driving forest loss and human rights abuses worldwide, and recent evidence shows that while there has been progress in some areas, the problem is far from solved. Corruption, weak governance, and a lack of effective enforcement continue to undermine reforms in many producing countries, leaving forests and communities exposed to abuse.

In the Congo Basin, one of the world’s most important forest regions, vast areas are being cleared to make way for agricultural expansion. This clearance is generating so‑called “conversion timber” – wood that comes from forests cut down to establish plantations or other agricultural projects. Much of this timber is highly suspect, yet it still enters international supply chains and ends up in major importing markets, including the European Union. The risk is that conversion projects become a convenient cover for illegal logging, driving deforestation while allowing companies to present their products as legitimate.

Greenpeace’s report “Trading in Chaos” sheds light on the Democratic Republic of Congo’s (DRC) chaotic forest sector. It documents how companies such as Cotrefor are able to export timber that should be considered illegal, while at the same time failing to honour basic obligations to local communities. These community contracts are supposed to ensure that people living in and around forest areas benefit from logging operations, but in practice they are often ignored or violated. The result is that communities lose their forests, their livelihoods, and their rights, while companies profit from the destruction.

Other organisations have highlighted the darker side of this trade. Global Witness’s “Blood Timber” report shows how some firms have gone beyond illegality and into outright complicity in conflict, helping to fund rebel groups through the trade in so‑called conflict timber. This timber has been traced into major markets, including the EU and China, revealing how international demand can fuel violence and instability in forest regions.

Chatham House has examined global trends in illegal timber and found that, despite various reforms, the scale of illegal trade has largely stagnated rather than declined. One of the key dynamics is the growing role of emerging economies in the timber market. China has become the world’s largest importer and processor of timber, while markets in India, South Korea, and Vietnam are also expanding. These shifts mean that efforts to tackle illegal logging cannot focus only on traditional consumer markets; they must also address the policies and practices of these rapidly growing importers.

At the same time, laws such as the EU Timber Regulation (EUTR) and the Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade (FLEGT) initiative remain essential tools. When properly enforced, they can help keep illegal wood out of supply chains, support better governance in producer countries, and protect the rights of local communities. Strong enforcement is critical: without it, regulations risk becoming paper promises while forests continue to fall.

Protecting the world’s forests is not only about safeguarding biodiversity and the climate; it is also about defending the people who depend on these ecosystems for their survival and culture. The evidence from the Congo Basin and beyond shows that illegal and destructive logging thrives where governance is weak and oversight is lacking. Ensuring robust enforcement of existing laws, and closing loopholes that allow suspect timber to reach global markets, is vital to ending this trade in chaos and securing a just, sustainable future for forests and communities alike.
