I remember arriving in Dumaguete City expecting exactly what the brochures and travel blogs promised: a peaceful coastal town, lush with greenery, framed by mountains and sea. The landscape is still beautiful—but it’s been scarred. Walking along the shoreline, what should have been clear water and clean sand was choked with discarded sachets, bottles, and food packaging. It was impossible to ignore that this wasn’t just “local litter.” The labels told another story.

For years, Southeast Asian countries like the Philippines have been singled out as the culprits of the global plastic crisis. But on the ground in Dumaguete, the truth is written in every tide line of trash. Much of the waste washing up here has its origins thousands of kilometres away, in Europe and North America. What looks like a local pollution problem is in fact the end point of a global system that treats communities like Dumaguete as a convenient dumping ground.

This reality has been documented in detail. A report by GAIA, based on waste and brand audits across the Philippines, identifies familiar household names as major contributors. Nestlé and Unilever stand out among the top sources of branded plastic waste. Their products, often packaged in small, single-use sachets, are everywhere in the piles of trash collected from streets, rivers, and coastlines. The report makes clear that this isn’t an accident—it’s the result of a business model that floods markets with disposable packaging, then exports the responsibility and the fallout.

Communities in places like Dumaguete are left to deal with the consequences: clogged waterways, polluted beaches, health risks from burning or dumping waste, and the slow erosion of livelihoods tied to fishing and tourism. Meanwhile, the corporations whose names are printed on this trash continue to profit, insisting that better waste management or more recycling will solve the problem, even as they push out ever more single-use plastics.

The GAIA report calls this what it is: a global waste trade that uses vulnerable communities as dumping sites. Containers of “recyclables” arrive from richer countries, but too often they contain mixed or contaminated plastics that cannot be properly processed. What can’t be recycled is burned, buried, or left to leak into the environment. The burden falls on local governments and residents who never asked for this role in the global economy of waste.

The way out of this crisis is not more of the same. The call from the frontlines is clear: corporations must phase out single-use plastics. That means redesigning products and delivery systems so that they rely on refill, reuse, and truly sustainable materials instead of endless disposable packaging. It means taking responsibility for the full life cycle of their products, rather than offloading the costs onto communities and ecosystems.

In the Philippines, people are not waiting for change to come from boardrooms. Local heroes are already leading the way. Activists like Froilan Grate and Merci Ferrer, part of the #BreakFreeFromPlastic movement, are working with communities to document the problem, challenge corporate narratives, and push for real solutions. Their work shows that when people come together to expose where this waste comes from and who profits from it, the story changes—from one that blames “littering” in Southeast Asia to one that confronts the global system driving plastic pollution.

Standing on a Dumaguete beach littered with branded trash, it’s impossible to see plastic pollution as an abstract issue. Each piece of packaging tells a story about who is responsible and who is paying the price. The courage and persistence of local leaders and movements are a reminder that this is not just a crisis of pollution, but of justice—and that it is past time for the corporations at the heart of this problem to act.
