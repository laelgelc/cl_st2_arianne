Across the world, people are turning to the courts because governments are failing to live up to the promises they made under the Paris Agreement. Instead of seeing rapid and fair climate action, communities are facing rising temperatures, worsening storms, and deepening inequalities — and they are demanding justice.

The legal community is increasingly stepping up to meet this moment. Tools like the International Bar Association’s Model Statute are helping judges, lawyers, and advocates evaluate scientific evidence, clarify responsibilities, and enforce rights. This kind of guidance is crucial for holding both governments and corporations to account when they undermine climate commitments or threaten human rights.

Greenpeace Southeast Asia is contributing to this growing movement by offering a guide focused on public accountability. This resource supports people and communities who want to use the law to challenge inaction, expose harmful practices, and push for policies that protect the climate and human rights.

More than 600 climate-related court cases have already been filed around the world. These cases are not abstract legal exercises — they are being brought by real people whose lives and futures are at stake. In the Netherlands, the Urgenda case led to a landmark ruling in the Dutch Supreme Court, compelling the government to strengthen its climate efforts. In Switzerland, the Klimaseniorinnen — a group of senior women — have taken their fight for climate protection all the way to the European Court of Human Rights, arguing that inadequate climate action violates their rights. In Norway, young people are leading a constitutional challenge, insisting that the state’s decisions respect their right to a safe and stable climate.

These cases are part of a broader global demand for justice. A Peoples’ Summit declaration has called for real access to justice for communities on the frontlines of the climate crisis, insisting that legal systems must be open and responsive to those harmed by climate inaction and fossil fuel expansion.

In the Philippines, this demand has taken shape in a groundbreaking move to hold major fossil fuel companies — including Exxon — liable for their role in driving climate impacts. By seeking accountability from corporations that have long profited from fossil fuels, communities are sending a clear message: those who contribute to the crisis must be held responsible.

From community groups to seasoned lawyers, from youth movements to senior citizens, people are using the law as a powerful tool to confront the climate emergency. As governments fall short of their Paris Agreement promises, courts are becoming critical arenas where rights are defended, responsibilities are clarified, and climate justice is pursued.
