In the middle of strange and uncertain times, it can be easy to lose sight of what is quietly constant beneath our feet and above our heads: we live on a magnificent planet.

Every day, Earth offers something that can surprise us. It might be a landscape we’ve never seen before, a pattern of clouds we’ve never noticed, or the way light changes the colour of a familiar place at a different hour. These are small reminders that our planet is not just a backdrop to our lives, but a living, changing world that has the power to renew our sense of wonder.

No one can see it all in one lifetime. There are more forests, coasts, mountains, rivers, and skies than any one person could ever hope to experience firsthand. That limit is, in itself, a kind of gift: it means there will always be more to discover, more to appreciate, more reasons to fall in love with this world again and again.

Amid the noise and confusion of our era, taking a moment to appreciate what we do have can be grounding. For many of us, that starts with simply remembering how lucky we are to call this planet home. Even when we cannot travel or explore as freely as we might wish, we can still reconnect with that feeling.

For those who are skeptical, or who feel too busy or overwhelmed to notice nature, there is a simple invitation: pause, and take a moment to appreciate our living world digitally. A photograph, a short video, a live stream of a wild place, or an image from space can offer a window into Earth’s beauty. It may not replace standing in a forest or on a shoreline, but it can still remind us of the richness and diversity that exist beyond our immediate surroundings.

In these strange times, choosing to appreciate the planet—whether through a window, a walk, or a screen—is a quiet act of recognition. It is a way of saying that this world, in all its beauty and surprise, is worth our attention, our gratitude, and our care.
