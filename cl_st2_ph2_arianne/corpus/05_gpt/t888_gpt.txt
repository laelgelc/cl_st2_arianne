In 2013, Greenpeace launched its Arctic campaign with a clear goal: to protect one of the most fragile and important regions on Earth from destructive industrial activity, especially oil drilling. Since then, more than eight million people around the world have joined the call for a protected sanctuary around the North Pole, turning a once-remote issue into a global movement.

This campaign has combined high-profile actions with sustained behind-the-scenes pressure. One of the most visible turning points came when Shell, after years of public opposition and mounting risk, retreated from its Arctic drilling plans. That retreat did not happen in isolation. It was shaped by a series of actions that exposed the dangers and injustices of Arctic exploitation and increased the financial and reputational risks for companies determined to drill in icy waters.

Among the most dramatic moments were the protests that drew global attention to the stakes in the Arctic. Thirty activists took part in a Russian protest that underscored both the courage of those willing to stand up to powerful interests and the lengths to which those interests would go to protect their operations. In Portland, activists turned back an icebreaker, physically halting a key link in the chain that enables Arctic drilling. In Bangkok, bicycle rallies brought the Arctic struggle into the streets of a city thousands of kilometres away, showing how deeply people everywhere care about this shared global environment.

These public actions were only one side of the story. Away from the spotlight, the campaign has worked to raise the costs and risks for companies seeking to drill in the Arctic. By exposing the dangers of spills, the instability of ice-covered waters, and the reputational damage associated with Arctic exploitation, the movement has helped make Arctic drilling a less attractive prospect to investors and decision-makers. Financial risk and public opposition have combined to weaken the ties between corporations and the political actors who support Arctic extraction.

This pressure has contributed to a shift among some Arctic nations toward greater protection of the region. While the struggle is far from over, the idea of the Arctic as a sanctuary—rather than a frontier for extraction—has gained ground in political debates and public consciousness.

At the heart of this movement is a commitment to respect Indigenous Peoples, whose lands, cultures, and livelihoods are directly affected by what happens in the Arctic. Their rights, knowledge, and leadership are essential to any vision of lasting protection.

The Arctic campaign is about more than a single region. It is an effort to inspire global change by showing that collective action can challenge powerful industries and reshape what is considered politically possible. From the ice edge of the North Pole to the streets of Portland and Bangkok, millions of people have demonstrated that the future of the Arctic is not just an environmental issue—it is a test of our willingness to protect the planet we share.
