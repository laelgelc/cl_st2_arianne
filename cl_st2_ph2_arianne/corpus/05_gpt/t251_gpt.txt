When I first stepped into activism ten years ago, I was driven by anger and hope in equal measure. Anger at the injustice of communities poisoned by pollution and pushed to the margins, and hope that if enough of us stood up, we could force change. A decade later, that hope is no longer abstract. I see it every day in the faces and work of young African climate activists who are reshaping what resistance and leadership look like on this continent.

Over these years, my journey through social justice and climate activism has taught me that struggle in Africa is never single-issue. Climate injustice is bound up with colonial histories, economic exploitation, land dispossession, and the daily realities of people who did almost nothing to cause this crisis yet are among the first to pay the price. Nowhere is this more visible than here in Africa, which is heating faster than many other regions despite contributing the least to global greenhouse gas emissions.

This contradiction is not a statistic to debate in conference halls; it is a lived reality. It is the farmer facing unpredictable rains, the fisher whose catch is dwindling, the family rebuilding again after yet another flood or drought. It is young people watching their futures shrink while being told to “wait their turn” in decision-making spaces where their lives are on the line.

And yet, across the continent, young Africans are refusing to be silent. They are organising, educating, mobilising, and building alternatives. Their work is grounded in community and rooted in love for our lands and people. I want to introduce ten of these young climate activists whose leadership is shaping a different future for Africa.

From North Africa to the southern tip of the continent, young people are building powerful movements. Ahmed in Tunisia is part of a wave of youth stepping into climate leadership, helping to amplify the urgency of action in a region already facing water stress and rising temperatures. His work reflects a broader energy among North African youth who are refusing to accept a future defined by climate chaos.

In the Congo Basin, Remy is organising in one of the most ecologically critical regions on Earth. The forests there are often called the lungs of the continent, and his activism is part of a wider effort to protect them from destruction. By standing up for forests and communities, he is helping to defend a vital climate shield for all of us.

In Uganda, Dixon is part of youth-led climate organising that refuses to separate environmental protection from justice. His work is a reminder that young people in East Africa are not waiting for permission to act; they are building their own platforms, speaking truth to power, and demanding real change.

From Kenya, Winnie is involved in movements like Fridays For Future, showing how global youth climate strikes have taken root and grown in African soil. Her activism connects local struggles with international calls for climate justice, insisting that African voices must be central in global debates.

Here in South Africa, Gabriel is part of a new generation of organisers who understand that climate justice is inseparable from broader social justice. His efforts sit within a long tradition of resistance in this country, but they also signal something new: a climate movement that is youthful, intersectional, and unapologetically African.

In Morocco, Fatna is contributing to the rising tide of youth climate action in a country already feeling the impacts of a warming world. Her work reflects the determination of young North Africans to defend their right to a livable future.

Back in Uganda, Evelyn is another powerful voice in the climate movement, helping to show that East Africa’s youth are at the forefront of both resistance and solutions. Together with others, she is part of a generation that refuses to be written off as “the future” and insists on being heard in the present.

In Libya, Anisa is raising her voice in a context marked by instability and overlapping crises. Her activism is a testament to the courage it takes to organise for climate justice in difficult circumstances, and to the conviction that even in times of turmoil, defending people and planet cannot wait.

From Senegal, Yero is part of a West African youth movement that understands climate change as a question of survival, dignity, and sovereignty. His efforts help highlight that the Sahel and surrounding regions are on the frontlines of climate impacts, and that young people there are responding with vision and resolve.

And in South Africa, Raeesah is among those building youth-led initiatives that connect climate justice with everyday struggles in our communities. Her work shows how activism can be both deeply local and firmly tied to global movements like Youth for Climate and Fridays For Future.

Across these stories, a common thread runs through: young Africans are not just participants in the climate movement; they are leading it. They are organising school strikes, building Youth for Climate groups, supporting Fridays For Future actions, planting trees, and creating community-based projects that restore ecosystems and dignity at the same time. Tree-planting initiatives across the continent, for example, are not only about carbon; they are about reclaiming land, restoring hope, and building resilience from the ground up.

As someone who has spent a decade in this work, I know that courage alone is not enough. These young activists need support, resources, and political space. They need decision-makers to listen, not just pose for photos. They need governments and corporations to stop treating Africa as a sacrifice zone for fossil fuels and extraction.

Africa is heating rapidly despite contributing the least to this crisis. That is an injustice that cannot stand. Supporting youth climate efforts on this continent is not charity; it is a moral and political obligation. It means backing movements like Youth for Climate and Fridays For Future. It means resourcing community projects and protecting the right to organise and protest. It means centring African youth in conversations about climate finance, adaptation, and loss and damage.

My own journey in activism has been shaped and renewed by the young people I stand alongside today. They remind me that another Africa is possible: one where our communities are not choking on pollution, where our forests and oceans are protected, where our economies are built on care rather than extraction, and where those who did the least to cause this crisis are finally placed at the centre of the solutions.

The question now is whether the rest of the world will choose to stand with them.
