Every day, I’m confronted with a contradiction.

On one hand, there is the relentless stream of news and evidence showing how much damage humans continue to inflict on our planet. It can be exhausting and, at times, deeply frustrating to watch the same destructive patterns play out again and again.

On the other hand, my work as a multimedia editor fills my days with something else entirely: images of nature’s stunning beauty. I spend hours looking at remote landscapes, wild coastlines, dense forests, and the intricate details of life that flourish far from cities and industrial sites. These images are a constant reminder that our home is breathtaking, powerful, and absolutely worth fighting for.

This Earth Day, I turned especially to those remote regions—places where Mother Earth’s creations still feel vast and untamed. The images I chose are a celebration of that raw beauty and resilience. They are a way of saying: this is what we stand to lose, and this is what we must protect.

For me, nature itself is the greatest force to preserve and care for. It’s what keeps me going when the headlines feel overwhelming and the progress too slow. Every glacier, forest, and ocean vista I see through my work reinforces the same message: we cannot give up.

I’d like to hear from you. What keeps you going in this fight for our planet? What helps you hold on to hope and determination when it feels like the damage is too great?

Share in the comments what motivates your own perseverance. Your stories, like these images, are part of the reason to keep fighting.
