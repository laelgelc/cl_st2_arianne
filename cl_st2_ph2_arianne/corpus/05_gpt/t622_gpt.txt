For decades, ExxonMobil has played a central role in the global story of climate change—both in what it knew, and in what it chose to do with that knowledge.

Evidence shows that Exxon’s own scientists understood the link between fossil fuels and climate change as early as 1957. Instead of acting on this information and warning the public, the company spent millions on campaigns that cast doubt on climate science, misled people about the risks, and delayed meaningful climate action. Those lost decades have come at an immense cost, as governments and communities are now scrambling to respond to a crisis that could have been addressed far earlier.

Today, Exxon acknowledges that climate change is a risk. Yet its business plans still put the world on a trajectory that could exceed the temperature limits governments agreed to in the Paris Agreement. That contradiction—between what Exxon says publicly and what it continues to do—lies at the heart of growing efforts to hold the company to account.

In Brussels, ExxonMobil is now facing an inquiry by the European Union, triggered by a petition from Food & Water Europe. The focus is Exxon’s role in spreading climate denial and obstructing climate policy. When the European Parliament organised a hearing on climate denial, Exxon refused to attend. That refusal has consequences: the company now risks losing its access to lobby EU institutions, a serious blow for a corporation that has long invested heavily in influencing policy.

This is not the first time Exxon has tried to avoid scrutiny. The company has previously sidestepped inquiries in the Philippines and has been the target of lawsuits in the United States over its record on climate deception. Each time, the pattern is similar: avoid public questioning, delay accountability, and continue with business plans that undermine global climate goals.

The inquiry in Brussels is a chance to push back against that pattern. Public pressure matters. One way to use that pressure is to directly question Exxon in the spaces it still relies on to shape its image.

You can join others in demanding answers by tweeting your questions to Exxon. Ask why it ignored its own science for decades. Ask how it justifies business plans that threaten to blow past the Paris climate limits. Ask why it refuses to face public hearings on its role in climate denial.

Every question adds to the pressure on Exxon to finally tell the truth and change course.
