For decades, women who wanted to work in Antarctica were told they didn’t belong there. They were rejected from expeditions on the basis of everyday sexism disguised as “practical concerns”: that there were no shops or hairdressers, that the extreme temperatures would be too harsh, that bases lacked the “right” facilities, or that women simply weren’t suited to serious scientific work. In some cases, these barriers stayed in place until the early 1980s, shutting women out of a continent that should have belonged to all of humanity.

These excuses were never about women’s abilities. They were about limiting who was allowed to explore, to research, and to protect one of the most remote and fragile places on Earth. Yet women persisted. Despite the dismissals and the closed doors, they kept applying, training, and pushing against the rules that excluded them. Their determination has transformed who is seen and heard in Antarctic science.

Today, women are an active and essential part of Antarctic research and protection. They work as scientists, technicians, and field researchers; as crew members, campaigners, and coordinators. Their presence is a direct challenge to the old idea that polar exploration is only for a narrow group of people—and a reminder that safeguarding the planet demands everyone’s skills and perspectives.

This change is visible on Greenpeace’s current expedition with the ship Arctic Sunrise. On board are women in many roles: scientists gathering crucial data, crew sailing and maintaining the ship, campaigners and others working together for a shared goal. That goal is to help secure the world’s largest protected area—an Antarctic Ocean Sanctuary—by the end of the year.

The creation of such a sanctuary would be a major step for ocean protection, helping to safeguard Antarctic waters and the life they support. The women on the Arctic Sunrise are part of the long line of those who refused to accept exclusion and who insisted that they had every right to be there, doing this work.

To mark International Women’s Day, Greenpeace has released a video from the Arctic Sunrise expedition, celebrating the women on board and the barriers they’ve helped to break. It’s a tribute not only to their courage and persistence, but also to the generations of women whose determination opened the way for them to sail south—and to stand at the heart of the fight to protect Antarctica.
