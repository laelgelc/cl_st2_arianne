The summer heat in Russia’s Yamal Peninsula did more than make life uncomfortable. It melted permafrost that had been frozen for decades, releasing anthrax bacteria that had lain dormant for around a century. The consequences were devastating.

More than 2,000 reindeer died in the outbreak. A 12‑year‑old boy lost his life. Nearly 400 people were evacuated from the area, over 100 were hospitalized, and 25 were treated. For the Indigenous Nenets people, whose lives and culture are closely tied to reindeer herding, the disaster struck at the heart of their way of life.

Nenets herder Alexey Nenyanga lost most of his reindeer. His belongings were destroyed in the response to the outbreak, and he now faces an uncertain future, unsure if or how he will be compensated. The loss is not just economic, but cultural and existential, undermining traditions that have been passed down through generations.

The outbreak was made worse by a decision taken years earlier. In 2007, authorities canceled the annual vaccination program for reindeer. Without that protection, once the bacteria emerged from the thawing ground, the animals were far more vulnerable.

This disaster did not come in isolation. Just two years before the anthrax outbreak, extreme weather had already killed 58,000 reindeer, which starved when ice sealed over the tundra and cut them off from their food. For the Nenets, these events form part of a pattern of escalating climate and environmental shocks.

In the Yamal Peninsula, climate change is not an abstract future threat. It is a present danger that is killing animals and people, uprooting communities, and pushing an entire Indigenous culture closer to the brink.
