Fossil fuel companies are wrecking lives and calling it business as usual. Their profits are built on polluted air, destroyed communities, and a global energy system that punishes the people who use the least but can afford it the least.

Around the world, the energy crisis is exposing just how deeply unfair this system is. Low-income households, who typically use far less energy, are often forced onto tariffs that charge them more per unit than wealthier, high-usage customers. The less you use, the more you pay. This upside-down logic is not an accident; it’s a feature of an energy model designed around profit, not people.

For many, this isn’t an abstract injustice—it’s a daily emergency. In Europe, high disconnection rates show how quickly families can be cut off when they can’t keep up with soaring bills. A missed payment doesn’t just mean a warning letter; it can mean waking up to no heat, no light, and no way to cook.

In other places, the cruelty is built into the technology itself. Prepayment meters in countries like South Africa and Australia are sold as a way to “help people manage their usage,” but in reality they force people into self-disconnection. When the meter runs out and there’s no money to top it up, the power simply shuts off. No negotiation, no safety net—just darkness. This silent wave of self-disconnections hides the true scale of the crisis, shifting the blame onto people who are already struggling instead of the companies and policies that created the problem.

The consequences are severe and immediate. Underheated homes make people sick. Cold, damp living conditions aggravate respiratory illnesses, strain already fragile health systems, and put the most vulnerable—children, older people, and those with chronic conditions—at serious risk. Being forced to choose between heating and other essentials is not just an economic hardship; it is a public health threat.

All of this is layered on top of the wider damage caused by fossil fuels. Burning coal, oil, and gas drives air pollution, climate disasters, and human rights violations. Communities on the frontlines of extraction face contaminated water, toxic air, and the loss of their lands and livelihoods. Those who have contributed the least to the climate crisis are hit first and hardest by floods, droughts, storms, and heatwaves made worse by a warming planet.

Yet while people are pushed into energy poverty and dangerous living conditions, fossil fuel giants like BP and Shell continue to report record profits. Their financial success is directly linked to the suffering of millions who cannot afford basic energy needs, and to the escalating climate chaos destabilizing our world.

This is not just an energy problem; it is a justice problem. Keeping the current system intact means accepting that some people will freeze in winter, breathe toxic air, or lose their homes to climate disasters so that a handful of corporations can keep cashing in.

It doesn’t have to be this way. Phasing out fossil fuels is essential to ending these inequalities. A rapid shift to renewable energy can break the link between basic human needs and corporate profit margins. Clean, affordable energy systems can be designed to prioritise people’s rights and wellbeing, not shareholder returns.

Climate justice means transforming who controls energy, who benefits from it, and who bears the risks. It means ensuring that no one is forced to choose between heating and eating, that no one’s health is sacrificed to keep fossil fuel profits flowing, and that communities are protected from both pollution and climate disasters.

Ending the age of fossil fuels and building a fair, renewable energy system is not just about cutting emissions. It is about ending a system that treats vulnerable people as expendable.
