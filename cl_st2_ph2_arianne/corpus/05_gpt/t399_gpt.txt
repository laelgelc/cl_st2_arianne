The world didn’t “build back better” after Covid; it doubled down on the same broken model that brought us to the brink in the first place.

Public services have been slashed just when communities need them most. Environmental protections are being brushed aside. Governments are pouring money into polluting industries while people face overlapping crises: wildfires raging in places like Siberia, and communities across the Global South hit hardest by climate impacts they did least to cause.

Instead of listening to science, many leaders are clinging to the old mantra of endless economic growth, whatever the cost. They talk about “green recovery” while signing off on fossil fuel projects. They praise “resilience” while underfunding healthcare, social protection, and climate action. This is not recovery; it’s a return to a more brutal version of business as usual.

Real change means more than a new slogan or a recycled press release. It means confronting the systems that created these crises: a global economy that treats nature as expendable, workers as disposable, and entire regions—especially in the Global South—as sacrifice zones. It means rejecting greenwashing and demanding that public money be used for public good, not corporate profit.

That’s why Greenpeace is joining the Climate. Care. Uprising alongside grassroots groups across 16 European countries and beyond. From September 23 to October 15, people are coming together in more than 70 actions and activities to demand that recovery funds tackle the crises at their roots: Covid, climate breakdown, neoliberalism, and colonialism.

This uprising is about insisting that recovery cannot mean more fossil fuels, more inequality, and more empty promises. It is about centering care—for people, for communities, and for the living world—rather than centering profit. It is about solidarity with those already living through climate devastation, especially in the Global South, and refusing to let their suffering be treated as a distant, acceptable cost of doing business.

In Europe, the gap between political rhetoric and scientific reality is stark. The EU’s current target of a 55% reduction in emissions by 2030 is not aligned with what science says is necessary. To help keep global heating within safer limits, emissions must be cut by around 65% by 2030. Anything less is a political choice to ignore scientific warnings and to pass greater harm on to younger generations and marginalized communities.

Recovery funds are a once-in-a-generation opportunity. They can either lock us into more fossil fuel dependence, more extraction, and more inequality—or they can help build a fair, renewable, and caring economy that stays within planetary boundaries. Right now, too many governments are choosing the first path.

The Climate. Care. Uprising is a collective refusal to accept that choice. It is a call to redirect public money away from polluters and towards healthcare, community resilience, renewable energy, and climate justice. It is a demand that the EU and national governments raise their ambition to match what science and justice require, not what polluting industries find convenient.

Everyone has a role to play. Joining actions, amplifying demands, and supporting movements that put people and planet first are all ways to push back against the slide into a harsher, more unequal version of the old normal. Between September 23 and October 15, and far beyond those dates, this is a chance to show that we will not accept a recovery that sacrifices our future.

The choice is clear: continue down the path of weakened protections, funded pollution, and ignored science—or stand with those insisting that recovery must mean real transformation. The Climate. Care. Uprising is about choosing the latter and demanding that governments finally put people and the planet at the heart of every decision.
