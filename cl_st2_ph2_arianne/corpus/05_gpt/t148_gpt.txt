Children born in 2020 will grow up in a world where the climate crisis is not a distant threat but a daily reality. By the time they reach 80, in 2100, they are likely to face more frequent and intense extreme weather, rising seas swallowing coastlines, and disrupted ecosystems—unless governments act now to cut emissions, protect nature, and rapidly scale up green energy.

These children’s futures depend on decisions being made today. Governments must phase out fossil fuels, invest in renewable energy, and defend forests, wetlands, and other ecosystems that store carbon and protect communities from floods and heat. Without this action, today’s babies will inherit a world far more dangerous and unequal than the one we live in now.

Younger generations are already stepping up. Gen-Z and millennials are using their voices and creativity to demand justice and accountability. Art—whether painting, music, poetry, or film—is becoming a powerful way to raise awareness, tell climate stories, and make the crisis visible to people who might not otherwise engage. Creative expression can turn abstract statistics into human experiences that move people to act.

Learning is another key tool. Resources such as Vanessa Nakate’s book offer insight into what it means to grow up in a world shaped by climate breakdown and inequality, and how young people—especially in Africa—are fighting back. These stories help connect the dots between droughts, floods, pollution, and the political and economic systems that allow them to continue.

Many young people are also turning to the law. Around the world, they are exploring legal avenues to hold big polluters and negligent governments to account. By challenging destructive projects and policies in court, they are asserting their right to a safe climate and a livable future.

Personal stories are central to this movement. When young people share how climate change affects their homes, health, education, and dreams, they expose the systemic injustices at the heart of the crisis. Those least responsible—often in the Global South, including many African communities—are already facing the harshest impacts. Recognizing this injustice is essential to building a fair response that protects everyone, not just the most powerful.

Youth leaders from Africa are at the forefront of this struggle. Their organizing, storytelling, and persistence show what determined action looks like in the face of droughts, floods, and environmental destruction. Their leadership is inspiring others to stand up for their rights, their lands, and their future.

There are many concrete ways to join this wave of action:

- Take part in FridaysForFuture climate strikes to show governments that young people are watching and demanding change.  
- Sign petitions that call on leaders to cut emissions, stop destructive projects, and support communities on the frontlines.  
- Use social media to share accurate information, amplify youth voices, and highlight local environmental struggles and solutions.  
- Protect green spaces in your community—parks, forests, and urban trees that cool cities, clean the air, and support biodiversity.

Local victories matter. In Nairobi, a campaign to save a single fig tree showed how public pressure can protect nature. People rallied around this tree because it symbolized more than just one plant—it stood for clean air, cultural heritage, and the right to shape the city’s future. The successful effort to protect it demonstrates that when communities organize, they can defend the living systems that keep cities and people healthy.

Children born in 2020 deserve more than a future defined by disaster. They deserve thriving ecosystems, safe homes, and governments that put people and planet before profit. Every strike, petition, artwork, legal challenge, and protected tree is part of building that future. The choices made now—by leaders and by all of us—will determine the world they inherit.
