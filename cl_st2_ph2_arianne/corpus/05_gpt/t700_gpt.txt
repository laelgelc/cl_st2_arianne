This year, Greenpeace supporters helped convince Samsung to take its first public steps toward shifting production lines away from fossil fuels and toward renewable energy. The announcement came at a time when communities around the world are facing increasingly extreme weather, and it offered a concrete sign that public pressure on major corporations can deliver real change.

Samsung’s move fits into a broader shift in South Korea, where there is a growing transition away from nuclear and fossil fuel energy. Recognizing Samsung’s global reach and influence, Greenpeace East Asia set out clear expectations for what meaningful action should look like. The organization laid out specific measures for Samsung to power its factories in China, the United States, and Europe with renewable energy. At the same time, Greenpeace East Asia urged the company to expand these efforts to its facilities in South Korea and Vietnam, and shared a detailed report with Samsung’s top leadership to guide the way forward.

Samsung is not the only major tech company responding to calls for clean energy. Facebook has committed to powering its global operations with 100% renewable energy by 2020, showing that large, energy-intensive companies can set ambitious goals and publicly track their progress.

These developments are part of a growing movement to push more corporations toward renewable energy and away from fossil fuels. With continued pressure and engagement from supporters, Greenpeace aims to build on these commitments and drive more companies to take responsibility for their climate impact by transitioning their operations to renewable power.
