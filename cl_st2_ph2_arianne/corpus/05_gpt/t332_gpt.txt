When I first stepped onto the Rainbow Warrior for the Global Protect the Oceans voyage, it felt like walking into a floating microcosm of the world I want to see: diverse, determined, and powered—literally and figuratively—by the wind.

I’m Yu-Chi “Kelly” Huang from Taiwan, and after years with Greenpeace East Asia, I’ve joined this campaign as the Onboard Digital Campaigner. My role is to help share what we witness at sea with people around the world, in real time, from one of the most iconic environmental ships ever built.

The Rainbow Warrior is cutting through the Pacific at around 7–10 knots, driven primarily by wind power. Life on board moves at that same steady pace. There is no rush—only the constant hum of coordinated work as an international crew navigates, maintains the ship, documents what we see, and plans how to turn those observations into pressure for change.

Our mission is clear: to bear witness to the mounting threats facing our oceans, from illegal fishing to the looming danger of deep-sea mining, and to use that evidence to push for a strong UN Oceans Treaty. Out here, the scale of the Pacific is overwhelming, but so is the scale of the damage we know is happening—much of it far from public view. That’s why being physically present matters. It allows us to document what’s happening and to show that these remote waters are not empty spaces; they are living ecosystems that need protection.

This voyage has been shaped by the realities of the pandemic. Organising nearly three months at sea with no ports is challenging under any circumstances; doing it safely in the age of COVID-19 adds another layer of complexity. Before boarding, everyone had to go through strict protocols: multiple PCR tests, quarantine, and careful monitoring. These measures are not optional—they are what make it possible for us to work closely together on a ship for weeks on end without putting each other at risk.

Once underway, those precautions define daily life. The ship is both our workplace and our home, and we have to protect it as a safe bubble. That means adapting routines, limiting outside contact, and planning every step of the journey with health and safety in mind, while still staying focused on why we’re here: to stand up for the oceans.

From the deck, watching the sails fill and the hull lean into the wind, it’s impossible not to think about what’s at stake. The same winds that carry us across the Pacific also carry our message: that the oceans need strong, enforceable protection, and that decisions taken at the UN must reflect the urgency we see at sea.

This voyage is long, and it isn’t easy. But every nautical mile we travel under sail, every threat we document, and every story we share brings us closer to the global action our oceans so urgently need.
