I was born on a day the world now calls the International Day of Forests. Long before I knew such a day existed, my birthday was simply the moment each year when the forest felt closest to my heart.

I grew up in Cameroon surrounded by trees that were more than scenery. They were playmates, guardians, and healers. As children, we ran along narrow paths under the canopy, collected fruits that stained our fingers and lips, and gathered herbs that our parents and grandparents used as medicine. The forest was our playground, our pharmacy, and our refuge. When life felt heavy or confusing, I could always find peace among the trees.

Those memories are not just nostalgic; they are the foundation of why I do what I do today. As a campaigner with Greenpeace Africa, I have seen how quickly those forests that shaped my childhood are being torn apart. Vast, living ecosystems are being cleared and replaced with monoculture plantations – endless rows of a single crop, grown for profit.

When a natural forest is destroyed, it is not only trees that disappear. The soil is disturbed, releasing carbon that had been stored safely for years. The plants and animals that once thrived there lose their home. Communities that depend on the forest for food, medicine, culture, and spiritual life are pushed aside. A plantation of one species can never replace the rich biodiversity, the complex relationships, and the deep medicinal value of a natural forest.

Yet industries continue to claim that planting trees somewhere else can “offset” the damage they cause. This is one of the most dangerous forms of greenwashing. Artificial plantings, often monocultures, are presented as a solution while the destruction of ancient forests continues. It allows business-as-usual pollution and land grabbing to carry on behind a thin green curtain.

Real solutions must start with respect: respect for nature and respect for the people who have protected forests for generations. Indigenous communities are not an afterthought; they are central to any meaningful forest policy. Their rights to land, culture, and self-determination must be recognized and enforced, not brushed aside when logging or plantation concessions are handed out. Their knowledge of how to live with the forest, not against it, is essential.

Too often, decisions about forests are made in distant offices, while the people who live closest to the trees are excluded. The result is predictable: forests are logged, communities are displaced, and a small number of outsiders reap the benefits. The climate becomes more unstable. Rains shift. Heat intensifies. The harmony that once existed between people and their environment is broken.

I have watched villages lose access to the lands that sustained them. I have listened to stories of elders who no longer recognize the places they grew up in. What was once a shared space of abundance and balance becomes a fragmented landscape of stumps and plantations, guarded by fences and security.

On my birthday, when the world marks the International Day of Forests, I think of the gap between the promises made in speeches and the reality on the ground. I think of children who may never know the joy of wandering freely under a dense canopy, tasting wild fruits, or learning the names and uses of medicinal plants from their grandparents.

Defending forests is not only about carbon or climate targets; it is about justice, memory, and the right of communities and species to exist in dignity. Forests are living worlds, not carbon accounts. Recognizing Indigenous rights, stopping destructive logging, and rejecting greenwashing are not optional extras – they are the path back to harmony between people and the forests that sustain us.
