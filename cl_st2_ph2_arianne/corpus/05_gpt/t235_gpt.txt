The European Union is on the verge of passing a law that could significantly reduce its role in global deforestation and human rights abuses. It is being described as a historic step, and in many ways it is: for the first time, companies placing certain high-risk commodities on the EU market would be required to trace their origins and prove they are not linked to forest destruction. But while this proposal has the potential to change how global supply chains operate, it is still deeply flawed – and unless it is strengthened, the EU risks missing a crucial chance to tackle the climate and nature crises at their roots.

At the core of the draft law is a due diligence obligation for companies trading in commodities that drive deforestation. Businesses would need to know exactly where their products come from and ensure they are not sourced from recently deforested land. This is a major shift from the current system, where companies can profit from environmental destruction while hiding behind complex supply chains and opaque sourcing. It is a long-overdue acknowledgment that Europe’s demand for products like beef, soy, and palm oil fuels forest loss and associated human rights abuses around the world.

However, the proposal draws an arbitrary line around what it considers worth protecting. It focuses only on forests, ignoring other vital ecosystems such as savannas and wetlands. These landscapes store huge amounts of carbon, support rich biodiversity, and are home to many communities, yet they are left exposed to ongoing destruction. Protecting forests while leaving savannas and wetlands unguarded is not a credible strategy for tackling the climate and nature emergencies.

The list of products covered by the law is also worryingly incomplete. Some major drivers of deforestation and ecosystem destruction – including rubber, maize, pork, and poultry – are not included. This means companies dealing in these products would not face the same obligations to clean up their supply chains. The risk is obvious: destructive production could simply shift from regulated commodities to those left out of the law, undermining its purpose and allowing business-as-usual to continue under a different label.

Another critical gap is the lack of robust protection for Indigenous Peoples and local communities. Around the world, Indigenous communities are on the frontlines of forest and ecosystem protection, often at great personal risk. Yet their rights – to their lands, territories, and resources, and to free, prior and informed consent – are not adequately safeguarded in the current proposal. Without clear and binding requirements to respect these rights, the law will not prevent land grabs, violence, and other abuses linked to commodity production.

The finance sector is also let off the hook. Banks, investors, and other financial institutions that pour money into destructive projects and companies are not properly covered by the proposed rules. This is a glaring omission. As long as finance continues to flow into deforestation and human rights abuses with no meaningful accountability, efforts to clean up supply chains will be undermined at their source.

These weaknesses have not gone unnoticed. Many corporations and industry groups are already pushing back, resisting stronger obligations and trying to water down the law. They argue that stricter rules would be too costly or complex, even as the environmental and human costs of inaction mount. This corporate resistance makes it even more important that people across Europe speak out and demand a law that matches the scale of the crises we face.

There is real momentum for change. At COP26, governments acknowledged the need to halt and reverse forest loss and land degradation. In Europe, 1.1 million people have already called for clean supply chains, demanding that the EU stop importing deforestation and human rights abuses. This public pressure helped bring the law this far – and it will be essential to make sure it is not weakened behind closed doors.

As EU governments and the European Parliament debate and amend the proposal, they have a clear choice. They can bow to corporate lobbying and settle for a law that looks ambitious on paper but leaves vast loopholes in practice. Or they can listen to the millions of people demanding real change and adopt strong, comprehensive rules that protect all threatened ecosystems, cover all major forest-risk products, uphold Indigenous rights, and hold the finance sector to account.

The current proposal shows that change is possible. It proves that the EU can take responsibility for its role in global deforestation and human rights abuses. But to truly live up to its promise, the law must be strengthened – not weakened. This is the moment for people across Europe to keep up the pressure on their governments and Members of the European Parliament, and to insist on a law that matches their commitments and their words with real, lasting action on the ground.
