The Dvinsky Forest in the Arkhangelsk region of Russia is one of the last remaining Intact Forest Landscapes in European Russia. It is home to rich wildlife, including eagle-owls, wolverines, brown bears, and other rare species that depend on large, undisturbed forest areas to survive. This forest is also part of the Great Northern Forest, which plays a crucial role in stabilising the global climate.

Despite its importance, the Dvinsky Forest is under severe threat from industrial logging. Logging operations are expanding into intact areas, and without strong protection, the forest could be largely destroyed within a decade. The loss would be devastating for biodiversity and would further weaken the climate-regulating function of the Great Northern Forest.

Certification schemes that are supposed to ensure responsible forest management, such as the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) and the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC), are failing to safeguard the Dvinsky Forest. Both schemes currently allow companies to maintain market access even when they source wood from intact forest areas. Within FSC, a key measure known as Motion 65, which is meant to secure protection for intact forest landscapes, is now at risk. PEFC, for its part, offers no meaningful support for protecting these areas.

In 2001, a Greenpeace campaign helped to halt logging in the core of the Dvinsky Forest through voluntary agreements with logging companies. For a time, this prevented the most destructive activities in the heart of the forest. But now, companies including Arkhangelsk Pulp & Paper Mill, ICE Titan, Solombalales, and Region-Les are pressuring regional authorities to allow logging to resume in these core areas. If these pressures succeed and no formal protection is put in place, the Dvinsky Forest could be effectively erased from the map of Europe’s intact forests within about ten years.

Greenpeace is calling on logging companies, regional and national authorities, and FSC to take responsibility and act immediately. The Dvinsky Forest must be granted strong, lasting protection from industrial logging to preserve its wildlife, maintain its role in the Great Northern Forest, and help safeguard the global climate.
