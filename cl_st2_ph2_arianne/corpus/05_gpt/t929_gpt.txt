Since 2014, Chiara Milford has chosen to step away from buying new clothes, instead building her wardrobe entirely from second-hand, inherited, or borrowed pieces. What began as a personal challenge has become a long-term way of dressing that puts sustainability and creativity ahead of disposable trends.

Worn fabrics and visible mending are central to how she now relates to her clothes. Rather than seeing frayed hems, loose seams, or faded colours as flaws, she embraces them as signs of a garment’s life and character. Upcycling has become a key part of this approach: adjusting fits, adding patches, or transforming one item into something completely different to extend its life and keep it in active use.

Thrift shopping plays a big role in how she sources what she needs. She points to its clear benefits: it’s more affordable than buying new, and it offers a chance to find unique pieces that stand apart from mass-produced fashion. At the same time, she acknowledges that it isn’t always easy. If you are looking for a very specific item, a particular size, or a precise style, it can take patience and persistence to track it down second-hand.

Beyond shops, she has turned to clothes swapping as another way to refresh a wardrobe without driving new production. Using social media to connect with others, she exchanges items that no longer work for her for pieces that someone else is ready to pass on. This shared wardrobe model reduces the pressure to constantly produce more clothing while helping each item find a longer, more varied life.

To make these shifts feel achievable, Chiara suggests setting simple, personal goals. Examples include deciding to buy nothing on Black Friday, or committing to wear each item in your wardrobe at least 30 times. These kinds of self-imposed guidelines can help break habits of impulse buying and encourage more thoughtful decisions about what we bring into our closets.

Running through her experience is a clear critique of disposable fashion and its environmental harms. The constant churn of trends encourages people to treat clothing as short-lived and easily replaced, feeding a system that consumes resources and generates waste. In response, she advocates for a different mindset: fix what you already own, alter what doesn’t quite work, and cherish the garments you have. For her, sustainable style is less about acquiring the “right” new thing and more about valuing, maintaining, and reimagining the clothes already hanging in our wardrobes.
