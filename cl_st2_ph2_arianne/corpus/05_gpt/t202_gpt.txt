As government representatives and policy-makers gather in Nairobi for UNEA 5.2, communities across Africa are living with the daily reality of the plastic pollution crisis they are there to discuss. For many, this is not an abstract environmental issue but a direct threat to livelihoods, health, and food security.

Fishers from coastal and inland communities are reporting what they see every day on the water: declining fish stocks, plastic tangled in their nets, and plastic found inside the fish themselves. For people who depend on fishing for both income and nutrition, this is a clear warning sign. When fish are fewer and increasingly contaminated, it undermines local economies and puts food security at risk. Fishers are calling for existing laws to be properly enforced, so that the rules meant to protect their waters and their work are not just words on paper.

Kenya is often cited as a leader in plastic regulation, having introduced bans on certain plastic products. Yet plastic pollution is still widespread. At the same time, there is ongoing pressure to weaken or roll back these hard-won restrictions. This contrast – strong laws on paper, but persistent pollution and efforts to dilute protections – shows why voluntary measures and partial bans are not enough. Without robust implementation and resistance to industry pressure, plastic continues to flood into communities and ecosystems.

The impacts are visible far beyond coastlines. In South African townships such as Lenasia, plastic pollution is worsening already harsh living conditions. Plastic waste clogs drainage systems, contributing to flooding that damages homes and infrastructure. When heavy rains come, blocked drains turn streets into rivers, and plastic waste becomes both a symptom and a driver of vulnerability, compounding social and economic hardships.

Even in remote areas, far from major cities and industrial hubs, plastic is making its mark. In parts of the Democratic Republic of Congo, fishers are encountering plastic in their fishing grounds, adding to the pressures they already face. The presence of plastic in such isolated places underlines how pervasive and far-reaching this crisis has become.

Against this backdrop, UNEA 5.2 in Nairobi is a crucial moment. It is an opportunity for governments to move beyond fragmented national efforts and agree on a strong global plastics treaty that addresses the problem at its source and throughout its full life cycle.

Such a treaty must include legally binding measures, not just voluntary commitments. It needs to tackle plastic from production to disposal, including measures that keep oil and gas in the ground, since most plastics are made from fossil fuels. Reducing plastic production at the source is essential if we are to prevent ever-increasing volumes of waste overwhelming communities and ecosystems.

The treaty should also promote refill and reuse systems that cut reliance on single-use plastics, and support effective, equitable waste management so that communities are not left to shoulder the burden of pollution they did not create. As economies shift away from fossil fuels and throwaway models, it is vital that workers and communities are supported through just transitions, ensuring that new paths are fair and inclusive.

From Kenyan fishers to residents of Lenasia and remote Congolese fishing communities, the message is consistent: plastic pollution is already reshaping lives and landscapes. UNEA 5.2 offers a chance for decision-makers in Nairobi to listen to those on the frontlines and commit to a global plastics treaty strong enough to match the scale of the crisis.
