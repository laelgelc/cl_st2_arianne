Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is an unconscionable act of aggression that is putting millions of people at risk and causing immense suffering. Cities including Kyiv, Kharkiv, Kherson, and Mariupol are enduring bombardment and siege, with residents facing fear, displacement, and the destruction of their homes and communities. The human cost of this war is already devastating, and it is growing every day.

More than 1.5 million people have fled Ukraine in search of safety, marking the onset of a major humanitarian crisis. Families are being separated, children are being uprooted, and people who only weeks ago were living ordinary lives are now forced to make impossible choices about whether to stay, flee, or send their loved ones away without knowing when—or if—they will be reunited.

This is not only a geopolitical conflict; it is a human emergency that demands solidarity, action, and support. Around the world, people are mobilizing to stand with those affected and to demand an end to the violence. There are many ways to offer concrete help, and a range of organizations are working to respond to urgent needs on the ground and at borders.

For those seeking to support refugees from Ukraine, UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, is working to protect and assist people who have been forced to flee. Africans Rising is helping Africans who are stranded and facing discrimination and danger as they try to leave the country. Stand with Ukraine is helping people connect with protests and solidarity actions, amplifying public pressure to stop the war.

For people trying to flee or in immediate need of assistance, War Help is supporting those escaping the conflict. The Ukrainian Red Cross is providing emergency aid, including medical assistance and support to vulnerable people. People in Need is working to deliver essential supplies and humanitarian relief to those affected.

Specific communities also need targeted support. OutRight Action is assisting LGBTQIA+ groups who are particularly at risk in times of conflict and displacement. Independent journalism is vital in war, and the Kyiv Independent is providing reporting from Ukraine, helping the world understand what is happening on the ground. Blood Agents is coordinating blood donations, which are critical for treating the wounded. Unicef is focusing on children and families, who are among the most vulnerable in this crisis.

Every act of solidarity matters. Supporting these organizations is one way to stand with the people of Ukraine and all those caught up in this war, to help meet immediate needs, and to insist that human lives and dignity must come before aggression and militarism.
