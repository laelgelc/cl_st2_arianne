As darkness fell over Oslo, the walls of Norway’s Parliament lit up with the words of those who will live longest with the consequences of today’s decisions: young people. Their messages, projected in giant letters and amplified through a megaphone, carried a clear and urgent demand to those in power: stop Arctic oil drilling and begin a rapid phase-out of fossil fuels to protect our shared future.

Youth and adults from around the world spoke about their fears of a rapidly deteriorating climate and the consequences of ignoring science. Their words echoed the same core concern: if governments like Norway’s continue to expand fossil fuel production, it will lock in more emissions, more warming, and more harm for generations to come. These messages were not abstract appeals—they were grounded in the reality that Norway’s exported CO₂ footprint from oil and gas is around ten times larger than its domestic emissions. While the country often presents itself as a climate leader, the sheer scale of emissions from the fossil fuels it exports tells a different story.

In front of Parliament, the voices amplified by Greenpeace demanded that Norway listen to climate science and act in line with its responsibilities. The call was simple and powerful: keep Arctic oil in the ground, and begin a managed, just transition away from fossil fuels before it is too late.

This public action connects directly to a historic legal case. Greenpeace Nordic and the youth organisation Nature and Youth have taken the Norwegian government to court over its decision to open up new areas of the Arctic for oil drilling. The lawsuit argues that granting new oil licenses violates Norway’s obligations under the Paris Agreement and its own Constitution, which guarantees the right to a healthy environment and safeguards for future generations.

The case has drawn support from more than 500,000 people, reflecting a growing global recognition that governments must be held accountable when they expand fossil fuel production in the middle of a climate crisis. Around the world, people have taken to the streets in solidarity with this legal challenge, joining protests that call on Norway to align its actions with its climate promises.

Outside the Parliament in Oslo, the projected words and the voices on the megaphone carried the same message as the legal arguments in the courtroom: a liveable future requires ending the search for new oil and gas, starting with the fragile and rapidly warming Arctic. The demands from youth and adults alike are clear—heed the science, respect human rights, and act now to protect the climate for current and future generations.
