Following the Galaxy Note7 fiasco, Samsung is standing at a crucial crossroads: it can either treat millions of faulty phones as waste, or turn this crisis into a turning point for the industry and the planet.

When Samsung recalled the Galaxy Note7, Greenpeace raised the alarm about what would happen to the 4.3 million devices already produced. Inside those phones are tonnes of valuable and finite resources, including cobalt, gold, silver, and tungsten. If these materials are not recovered and reused, they risk becoming part of a growing mountain of electronic waste instead of remaining in circulation where they are needed.

Public concern and pressure from governments around the world have pushed Samsung to respond. The company has acknowledged these concerns and has said it is reviewing options to minimize the environmental impact of the recalled devices. This recognition is important, but it is only a first step.

What happens next matters far beyond the Note7. Samsung now has an opportunity to show real leadership by rethinking how its products are designed, made, and handled at the end of their lives. That means moving away from a throwaway model and towards devices that are durable, repairable, and built from recycled materials.

Samsung already refers to circular economy principles on its website. Those same principles should now guide concrete action: keeping materials in use for as long as possible, designing products so they can be repaired and upgraded, and ensuring that the resources inside every phone are recovered and reused instead of destroyed.

Greenpeace is calling on Samsung to be transparent about its plans for the Galaxy Note7 and to avoid any path that leads to the destruction of these phones and their components. Instead, this moment should be used to rethink product design, production, and reuse across Samsung’s entire business.

By choosing reuse over destruction, and durability over disposability, Samsung can help set a new standard for the electronics industry—one that benefits consumers and protects the planet.
