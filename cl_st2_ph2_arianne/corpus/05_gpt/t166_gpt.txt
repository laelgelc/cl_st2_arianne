Oil is leaving a trail of destruction across the world. In Thailand, Peru, Ecuador, and Nigeria, recent spills have poisoned waters, devastated ecosystems, and killed wildlife. Coastal and riverine communities are left to cope with contaminated fisheries, ruined livelihoods, and long-term health risks. These disasters are not isolated accidents—they are symptoms of an industry built on risk, sacrifice zones, and the assumption that some people and places are expendable.

In Yemen, a looming threat hangs over the region as an aging oil facility risks unleashing a catastrophic spill. The potential consequences for the Red Sea’s fragile ecosystems and the millions of people who depend on them are enormous. This danger underlines how oil infrastructure can become a ticking time bomb in unstable regions, where conflict, neglect, and corporate and political inaction combine to magnify the risks.

Oil is not just a driver of pollution; it is deeply entangled with wars, conflicts, and the global arms trade. Revenues from oil and gas help fuel military aggression and repression. Russia’s military, for example, is heavily funded by fossil fuel income, tying the global energy system directly to violence and instability. As long as economies remain dependent on oil, gas, and coal, regimes that profit from these resources will continue to wield them as tools of power and war.

Meanwhile, major oil companies like BP, Shell, and Exxon continue to profit from crisis. Even as spills destroy lives and landscapes, these corporations post enormous earnings and reward shareholders. At the same time, they invest heavily in greenwashing—marketing themselves as part of the solution while expanding fossil fuel extraction and delaying real change. Their glossy ads and net zero pledges cannot erase the basic fact that oil is toxic at every stage of its lifecycle: from exploration and drilling to transport, refining, burning, and waste.

This toxicity extends far beyond visible disasters like spills. Burning fossil fuels is a major driver of climate change, heating the planet and intensifying storms, floods, droughts, and wildfires. Communities that played little role in creating the crisis are often those hit hardest. Air pollution from fossil fuels also silently kills millions of people every year, through heart disease, strokes, lung cancer, and respiratory illnesses. These deaths are not “externalities”; they are the predictable result of a system that treats clean air and a stable climate as optional.

The industry has long known the dangers. Decades ago, oil companies were warned by their own scientists and external experts about the climate impacts of their products. Instead of changing course, many chose to fund denial, cast doubt on climate science, and lobby against regulations that would cut emissions. This deliberate obstruction has delayed action and deepened the crisis, even as evidence of harm has mounted.

In this context, major fossil fuel firms are rightly called climate criminals. Their choices have locked the world into a path of escalating climate breakdown, conflict, and pollution. Communities in Thailand, Peru, Ecuador, Nigeria, Yemen, and far beyond are living with the consequences today.

The way forward is clear: we must end the fossil fuel era and accelerate a just transition to renewable energy. That means rapidly scaling up wind, solar, and other clean technologies, while ensuring workers and communities dependent on fossil fuel economies are supported through the transition. It means holding corporations and governments accountable for past and ongoing harms, and rejecting greenwashing that distracts from the need to keep oil, gas, and coal in the ground.

Every new spill, every polluted breath, and every life disrupted by climate disasters is a reminder that the cost of fossil fuels is far higher than any short-term profit. A world powered by clean, renewable energy is not only possible—it is urgent, and it is the only path that protects people, nature, and the climate.
