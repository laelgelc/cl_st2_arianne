Oreo has built its image around the idea of “wonder” – with colourful videos, TV campaigns and a catchy song inviting people into a playful, feel‑good world. But behind the “Wonderfilled” slogan lies a far less magical reality.

The company behind Oreo, Mondelez, buys palm oil from Wilmar, the world’s largest palm oil trader. Wilmar has been repeatedly linked to forest destruction and human rights abuses in Indonesia. This means that the palm oil helping to keep Oreo cookies on supermarket shelves is also helping to drive the destruction of some of the world’s most precious rainforests.

Countries including Italy, Japan, France and Indonesia are waking up to this problem. They are recognising that the companies producing palm oil for Oreo cookies are contributing to rainforest devastation. These forests are home to incredible biodiversity and are vital for the people who depend on them for their livelihoods, culture and survival.

Greenpeace volunteers across the globe have been taking action to expose this hidden cost of a household favourite snack. From creative protests to public outreach, they are making sure that Oreo and its parent company cannot hide behind advertising campaigns while their supply chain is linked to forest destruction.

More than a million people have already signed a petition calling on Oreo to stop buying from forest destroyers. This growing movement is sending a clear message: no brand can claim to spread “wonder” while its ingredients are tied to rainforest loss and human rights abuses.

You can stand with the communities and wildlife that rely on healthy forests. Add your name to the call for Oreo and Mondelez to clean up their supply chains and stop sourcing from companies that destroy forests. Together, we can help protect the world’s rainforests and the lives that depend on them.
