At this year’s annual global leadership meeting, Greenpeace Executive Directors Jennifer Morgan and Bunny McDiarmid brought a clear focus: #TimesUp on injustice, unsafe workplaces, and a lack of diversity.

Building on the reflections sparked by the #MeToo movement, leaders across the Greenpeace network came together to confront how power, safety, and equity show up inside the organisation. The outcome was a set of concrete commitments that were agreed unanimously.

One of the central decisions was to create dedicated reporting spaces for people who have experienced sexual harassment. These spaces are intended to make it easier and safer for survivors to come forward, be heard, and receive support. Alongside this, Greenpeace will establish a complaints team to ensure that concerns are handled consistently and taken seriously.

Investment in training was another key commitment. Greenpeace will put resources into training on harassment prevention, unconscious bias, and diversity. The goal is to help everyone in the organisation better understand harmful behaviours, recognise bias, and build a more inclusive culture.

Leadership representation is also part of this shift. Greenpeace is aiming for 50% women in senior leadership. This is about changing who holds power and ensuring that decision-making spaces reflect greater gender balance.

The organisation’s global integrity systems will be improved by October 2018. This includes strengthening anti-harassment policies so that there is zero tolerance for bullying, discrimination, or harassment. When complaints are made, Greenpeace has committed to thorough investigations and to taking appropriate action.

Underlying all of these decisions is a shared commitment to address equity and create safe spaces across the Greenpeace network. For Jennifer Morgan, Bunny McDiarmid, and the wider leadership, #TimesUp is not just a hashtag—it is a mandate to ensure justice, safety, and diversity within the organisation.
