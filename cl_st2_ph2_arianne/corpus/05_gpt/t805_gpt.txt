Around the world, more and more of us are starting to question the idea that happiness comes from buying more stuff. MAKE SMTHNG Week is all about turning that doubt into action, and showing how we can live well without feeding a system of hyperconsumption that damages the climate, destroys forests, and pollutes our oceans.

Hyperconsumption is the pattern of buying more than we need, more often than we need it, and throwing things away faster than ever before. It’s built into how food, fashion, and technology are produced and sold. Planned obsolescence – when products are designed to break, go out of style, or become “old” quickly – means we’re pushed to replace instead of repair. The result is shocking: we now buy about twice as many clothes as we used to, but we wear them only half as long. In many cases, getting something fixed actually costs more than buying a new one, so the system nudges us towards waste at every turn.

The consequences are everywhere. Forests are cleared to make way for more production. Climate change accelerates as energy and resources are poured into short-lived products. Plastic packaging and single-use items pile up in landfills and leak into rivers and oceans. Our wardrobes, gadgets, and convenience foods come with hidden costs that the planet is paying.

MAKE SMTHNG Week offers a different vision: a culture that values resources, creativity, and care instead of endless consumption. It invites people to slow down, use what they already have, and rediscover skills that keep things in use for longer. Repairing a broken item, upcycling old materials into something new, choosing vegan alternatives, and refusing single-use plastics are all ways to step out of the throwaway mindset.

From November 23 to December 2, 2018, DIY enthusiasts, makers, and anyone curious about living differently are invited to join global events organized with Greenpeace and partners. These gatherings bring people together to share knowledge, swap ideas, and start building practical alternatives to hyperconsumption in their own communities.

Getting involved is simple. You can use the MAKE SMTHNG guidelines to plan or join activities, check the events calendar to see what’s happening near you, and explore the branding toolkit to help spread the word. Online, the movement continues on Instagram at @makesmthng and through the hashtag #makesmthng, where people share their creations, tips, and experiences.

By choosing to repair instead of replace, upcycle instead of discard, go vegan more often, and avoid single-use plastics, each of us can help shift the culture away from waste and towards respect for the resources we share. MAKE SMTHNG Week is an invitation to start that shift together.
