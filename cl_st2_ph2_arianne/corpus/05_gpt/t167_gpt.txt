For more than a century, Coca-Cola and Pepsi have battled for the top spot in the global soft drink market. That rivalry has shaped everything from advertising to product placement, but now it needs to shape something far more important: their impact on the planet.

Both companies are among the world’s top plastic polluters, flooding communities and ecosystems with single-use plastic bottles and packaging. This plastic pollution crisis is tightly linked to the climate crisis. Plastic is made from fossil fuels, and every step of its life cycle—from extraction and production to disposal—drives greenhouse gas emissions and environmental destruction. As long as companies rely on single-use plastic, they are helping to fuel climate change and the degradation of oceans, rivers and communities.

Coca-Cola has recently committed to making at least 25% of its packaging reusable or refillable by 2030. This is far from enough to solve the problem, but it does set a clear benchmark in an industry that has been slow to move away from throwaway packaging. Pepsi, by contrast, is currently at 0% reusable or refillable packaging and has only pledged to set a reuse goal by the end of 2022. In the context of the scale and urgency of the plastic and climate crises, that is nowhere near sufficient.

Reuse systems—where bottles and containers are designed to be returned, washed and refilled many times—are essential to cutting plastic waste at the source. They reduce the volume of plastic entering oceans and waterways and lessen the demand for new plastic production. But reuse cannot be scaled up overnight. It requires investment in infrastructure, such as collection and washing systems, and collaboration across supply chains, retailers and governments. Global brands like Pepsi and Coca-Cola are uniquely positioned to drive this transformation because of their size, reach and resources.

If Coca-Cola can put a concrete reuse commitment on the table, Pepsi can and must do better. Matching 25% by 2030 would simply keep the company in Coca-Cola’s shadow on an issue where leadership is urgently needed. Pepsi’s long-standing rivalry with Coca-Cola should now be about who can move fastest and furthest to phase out single-use plastics and support real solutions.

The upcoming May shareholder meeting is a critical moment. Investors, customers and communities have an opportunity to demand that Pepsi’s CEO commit to a meaningful, time-bound target: at least 50% reusable or refillable packaging by 2030. That kind of commitment would signal a real shift away from the single-use model that has helped make Pepsi one of the world’s top plastic polluters.

Pressure from the public and shareholders has already begun to push major brands to act. Now, it needs to intensify. Before the May meeting, people can contact Pepsi’s leadership, speak up as shareholders or consumers, and call for a clear, ambitious reuse target. The choice facing Pepsi is simple: cling to a wasteful, polluting status quo, or finally outdo its rival where it matters most—by cutting plastic at the source and helping to tackle the climate and plastic crises together.
