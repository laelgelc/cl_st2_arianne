The climate crisis is already reshaping lives and landscapes across the world, and it is doing so unevenly. Millions of people are facing rising seas, droughts, floods and storms that threaten their homes, cultures and futures. Yet the voices of those most affected—especially Indigenous communities and people in the Global South—are too often sidelined in international negotiations and media coverage.

At COP26, young activists from frontline communities refused to be ignored. They brought their stories, demands and determination into a space that has long been dominated by those most responsible for the crisis, but least affected by its impacts.

From Ethiopia, Yared Abera spoke from a country already experiencing the harsh realities of a changing climate. From Brazil, Samara Assunção and Txai Suruí highlighted the stakes for communities living in and defending vital ecosystems. From Chad, Hindou Oumarou Ibrahim brought the perspective of Indigenous peoples whose knowledge and lives are intimately tied to the land.

Voices from Aotearoa, Rwanda, Uganda, Pakistan, Colombia, the Philippines and the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation made clear that climate breakdown is a shared struggle, but not an equal one. India Logan-Riley from Aotearoa, Ineza Umuhoza Grace from Rwanda, Vanessa Nakate from Uganda, Aisha Akbar from Pakistan, Maytik Avirama from Colombia, and Ryan Bestre and Marinel Ubaldo from the Philippines all carried the experiences of their communities into the halls of power. From the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, Leala Pourier spoke as part of a long history of Indigenous resistance and resilience.

These young leaders did more than bear witness. They demanded concrete commitments and real action, insisting that decisions made in negotiation rooms reflect the realities outside them. Each brought a unique perspective shaped by their land, culture and community, and they did so in the face of intimidation and marginalisation that often seeks to silence or discredit them.

Their presence at COP26 underscored a simple truth: those who are paying the highest price for the climate crisis must be at the centre of decisions about how the world responds. The courage of these young activists, standing together across continents, is a powerful reminder that climate justice is inseparable from listening to—and acting on—the voices of those most impacted.
