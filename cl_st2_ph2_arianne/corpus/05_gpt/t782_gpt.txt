For nearly two years, Greenpeace has been forced to fight off massive, baseless lawsuits designed to silence environmental activism. These Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation (SLAPPs) have been brought by corporate bullies, with support from Donald Trump’s law firm, in an attempt to drain our resources and derail our work for a green and just future. Allies who stand with us have also been targeted.

Today, Greenpeace filed a motion to dismiss one of these SLAPPs. This is part of our ongoing effort not only to defend our right to speak out, but to push back against a broader strategy of intimidation aimed at climate and forest defenders.

Almost two years ago, Resolute Forest Products launched an unprecedented CAD$300 million lawsuit against Greenpeace defendants, using the U.S. Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act. RICO was created to go after organized crime—not advocacy groups and activists. Using this law against Greenpeace was a clear attempt to mislabel legitimate campaigning as criminal activity, and to send a chilling message to anyone who dares to challenge powerful corporate interests.

Public support quickly grew in response. People across communities and movements recognized these lawsuits for what they are: attempts to silence criticism and shut down public participation in environmental decision-making.

Three months ago, that support was vindicated in court. A U.S. judge dismissed Resolute’s case in its entirety. The court went further, ordering Resolute to reimburse Greenpeace’s attorney fees under California’s anti-SLAPP law—an important protection designed to shield people and organizations from abusive lawsuits targeting their free speech.

This legal win underscores that corporations cannot simply rewrite the rules to escape public scrutiny. While SLAPPs are meant to intimidate and exhaust, they can be defeated. Greenpeace will continue to stand up to legal bullying, defend the right to speak truth to power, and keep fighting for a green future for all.
