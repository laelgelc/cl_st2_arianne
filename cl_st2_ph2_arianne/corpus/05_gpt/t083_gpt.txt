Brazil’s National Institute for Space Research (INPE) reported that 11,568 km² of Amazon rainforest was destroyed between July 2021 and August 2022. That area is equivalent to 1.6 million soccer fields, underscoring the scale and speed of the ongoing destruction.

Over the full term of President Jair Bolsonaro (2019–2022), the Amazon lost 45,586 km² of forest. This represents a 53% increase in deforestation compared to the period from 2015 to 2018. The surge is linked to Bolsonaro’s anti-environment and anti-Indigenous policies, which opened space for illegal logging, mining, and land-grabbing. During this time, no new Indigenous Lands were officially recognized, breaking with protections that had been in place since 1988.

These policies have pushed the Amazon closer to a dangerous tipping point. Some parts of the forest are now emitting more carbon than they store, undermining its role as a crucial carbon sink. Deforestation-driven fires are responsible for 40% of Brazil’s greenhouse gas emissions. These fires also damage public health, compounding the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on vulnerable communities.

In Brazil’s recent election, Bolsonaro was defeated by Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (Lula), who has pledged to protect the Amazon and defend Indigenous rights. Lula attended the COP27 climate summit, signaling a renewed engagement with global climate efforts. However, reversing the damage will require more than promises. The new government must put in place strong, concrete plans to halt deforestation, safeguard Indigenous territories and rights, and ensure that those responsible for environmental crimes are held to account.
