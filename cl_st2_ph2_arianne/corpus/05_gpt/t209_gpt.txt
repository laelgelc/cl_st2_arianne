Across Europe, fossil fuel companies are splashing rainbows, smiling cows, and iconic wildlife across glossy billboards and sponsorship banners – all to disguise a dirty reality. Instead of showing oil spills, gas rigs, and pipelines, brands like Shell, Total, and Eni are selling us images of harmony with nature. It’s a calculated strategy to make fossil fuels look friendly, modern, and indispensable, even as they drive the climate crisis.

These companies are not alone. Energy utilities, car manufacturers, and fuel retailers are also buying social acceptance with “feel‑good” sponsorships. Cultural events, festivals, sports, and local initiatives are being co‑opted by companies like Acea, Lexus, Plenoil, and Endesa. Their logos appear next to children’s activities, art exhibitions, and community projects, quietly associating fossil fuels with culture, creativity, and progress.

This is greenwashing in its purest form: using soft colours, cute animals, and wholesome scenes to distract from the core business model of extracting and burning fossil fuels. The goal is not just to sell more products, but to delay and weaken climate action by making the public feel that these companies are already part of the solution.

To expose this manipulation, volunteers from Greenpeace and many other groups have been documenting fossil fuel advertising and sponsorships across Europe. Through the interactive #BanFossilAds map, people in 40 European cities have already uploaded more than 100 examples. Each pin on the map reveals a billboard, poster, or event banner that tries to rebrand fossil fuel companies as climate champions.

The map is simple but powerful. Anyone can upload photos, locations, and details of ads and sponsorships, helping to reveal the patterns and tactics behind this PR offensive. The more people contribute, the clearer it becomes how widespread and coordinated this greenwashing really is.

Film director Adam McKay, known for taking on powerful industries, has been outspoken about the damage these ads cause. He argues that fossil fuel advertising should be treated like cigarette advertising – banned because it promotes products that harm people and the planet. Just as tobacco companies were once allowed to sponsor sports and cultural events to appear respectable, fossil fuel companies are now using the same playbook to cling to legitimacy.

That’s why campaigners are calling for a full ban on fossil fuel advertising and sponsorships in Europe. This isn’t about silencing debate; it’s about stopping an industry with a direct interest in climate delay from buying our trust with misleading images and feel‑good branding.

You can help push back against this greenwashing:

- Use the #BanFossilAds map and toolkit to spot and document fossil fuel ads and sponsorships in your city.
- Upload clear photos and details whenever you see fossil fuel and high‑polluting companies trying to associate themselves with nature, culture, or community life.
- Share the map with friends, local groups, and on social media to raise awareness of these manipulative strategies.
- Most importantly, sign the European Citizens’ Initiative calling for a ban on fossil fuel advertising and sponsorships. It needs 1 million signatures to move forward.

Fossil fuel companies want us to see rainbows and happy animals instead of the climate damage they cause. By exposing their tactics and demanding a ban on fossil ads, we can strip away the green gloss and make space for real climate solutions.
