The latest update of the IPCC’s “Burning Embers” diagram in the 6th Assessment Report sends a stark message: climate risks are escalating faster and at lower levels of warming than previously assessed. What was once considered a safer operating space for humanity is shrinking, and the consequences of even modest temperature increases are becoming more severe and more apparent.

The “Burning Embers” diagram has been a visual centerpiece of IPCC assessments since 2001. It illustrates how risks grow—from moderate, to high, to very high—as global average temperature rises. Over successive reports, the same picture has been redrawn again and again, each time shifting the colors of danger to lower temperature thresholds. The 6th Assessment Report continues this trend, showing that the world is entering the “high risk” zone much earlier than the 5th Assessment Report (AR5) or the Special Report on 1.5°C (SR15) had indicated.

In this latest assessment, new scientific evidence has sharpened our understanding of how sensitive key Earth systems are to warming. Research on ice-sheet instability reveals that the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets may be more vulnerable than previously thought, with potential implications for long-term sea-level rise. Observations and modelling of the ocean circulation show signs of slowdown in major systems that help regulate global climate, raising concerns about cascading regional impacts. Changes in the carbon cycle—how carbon moves between the atmosphere, oceans, and land—are also better understood, underscoring the risk that natural systems may absorb less carbon in the future, leaving more heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere.

Crucially, the updated “Burning Embers” diagram makes clear that even limiting warming to 1.5°C does not mean a world free of danger. At this level, the IPCC now assesses high risks for extreme weather events, ecosystems, and other critical systems. Heatwaves, heavy rainfall, and other extremes are expected to become more intense and more frequent. Ecosystems that are already under stress are pushed closer to their limits.

Coral reefs are one of the clearest examples of this accelerating risk. At around 1.1°C of global warming—approximately where we are today—coral ecosystems are already in transition. Mass bleaching events and mortality are no longer isolated crises but part of an ongoing shift that threatens the survival of these biodiversity hotspots and the communities that depend on them. The updated diagram reflects this reality: the onset of high and very high risks for coral reefs and similar ecosystems is now placed at lower temperature thresholds than before.

The evolution of the “Burning Embers” diagram since 2001 tells a consistent story. As scientific understanding improves and real-world impacts accumulate, the recognized risks of climate change move earlier along the temperature scale. What used to be seen as relatively safe levels of warming are now associated with escalating dangers to people, ecosystems, and key Earth systems.

This tightening of the risk picture has direct implications for policy. By showing that high and very high risks emerge at lower temperature increases, the 6th Assessment Report reinforces the urgency of holding the line at 1.5°C. The diagram is not just a scientific visualization; it is a warning to governments, industries, and financial institutions that delays in cutting emissions will lock in higher levels of risk much sooner than earlier reports suggested.

The updated “Burning Embers” make it clear that the window for avoiding the worst impacts is narrow, and that the 1.5°C limit is not a symbolic target but a real threshold beyond which climate risks intensify rapidly. The message is straightforward: acting now to reduce emissions and transform energy, transport, and land-use systems is essential to keep climate risks from spiralling into the highest danger zones depicted in the diagram.
