Across cultures and centuries, humans have grappled with their relationship to the natural world. Long before modern science, religious traditions and early literature were already warning of the consequences of ecological harm and calling for respect toward the environment.

Ancient texts offer some of the earliest expressions of environmental awareness. Vedic hymns from the Indian subcontinent, for example, are filled with reverence for rivers, forests, and the elements, reflecting a worldview in which nature is sacred and interconnected with human life. In China, Taoist principles emphasised harmony with the natural order, urging people to live simply and in balance with their surroundings rather than trying to dominate them. Even the great epics of Mesopotamia contain warnings about environmental destruction, with stories that link human excess and disregard for nature to disaster and downfall.

As societies grew and cities expanded, concerns about pollution and degradation became more visible. In medieval times, people in urban centres were already complaining about foul air, contaminated water, and the health impacts of waste and industrial activity. These early reactions to pollution showed that environmental harm was not just a modern phenomenon, but a recurring problem wherever human populations and economic activities intensified.

The 18th and 19th centuries saw new voices and ideas that would later shape ecology and conservation. Figures like Benjamin Franklin raised alarms about water pollution and public health, pushing for cleaner urban environments. Henry David Thoreau drew attention to the spiritual and ethical value of wild nature, arguing that forests, lakes, and open spaces were essential to human well-being. Around the same time, Ernst Haeckel helped establish the scientific foundations of ecology, giving a name and framework to the study of organisms and their relationships with each other and their environments.

In the 20th century, environmental awareness expanded rapidly and began to influence public policy and global movements. Rachel Carson’s book Silent Spring exposed the dangers of pesticides, transforming public understanding of chemical pollution and its impacts on ecosystems and human health. Anti-nuclear campaigns mobilised people across borders, linking environmental protection with peace and questioning technologies that threatened both the planet and future generations. Grassroots movements such as the Chipko movement in India showed how local communities, and especially women, could organise to protect forests and challenge destructive development.

Amid this growing wave of activism, Greenpeace was founded in 1969, emerging from anti-war and anti-nuclear campaigns with a commitment to non-violent direct action for the planet. Its early voyages and campaigns helped bring global attention to issues like nuclear testing and whaling, building on a long history of environmental concern while pushing it into the international spotlight.

The story continued with the Rainbow Warrior, the Greenpeace ship that became a powerful symbol of environmental resistance and solidarity. Its missions and the struggles surrounding it highlighted both the courage of activists and the lengths to which powerful interests would go to defend destructive practices.

From ancient hymns and philosophical traditions to modern science, mass movements, and direct action, the thread is clear: people have long understood that harming the Earth ultimately harms ourselves. Yet despite centuries of warnings and hard-won progress, global environmental challenges remain profound. Pollution, habitat loss, climate disruption, and the ongoing exploitation of land, oceans, and communities show that this history is not just a record of past struggles, but a call to continue and deepen them today.
