Across the globe, communities are facing a deepening water crisis. Cape Town came dangerously close to “day zero” – the moment when taps would run dry – and even though catastrophe was narrowly avoided, the city still lives with water scarcity. It is not alone. Around the world, half a billion people are struggling with limited access to water, and the problem is being made worse by one of the dirtiest industries on earth: coal.

Coal’s water footprint begins long before it is burned. Mining tears open landscapes, exposing rock and soil and allowing toxic substances to leach into nearby rivers and groundwater. Washing coal to prepare it for burning uses and contaminates more water still. At every stage, heavy metals and other pollutants can end up in the water that people depend on for drinking, farming, and fishing.

This is not an abstract risk; it is already happening. In Indonesia, coal operations have polluted rivers that communities rely on. In India and China, coal mining and power generation have put enormous pressure on already scarce water resources, worsening shortages and contamination. In Australia, coal has damaged rivers and aquifers in regions where water is precious, fuelling conflicts between coal companies, farmers, and local communities.

Once coal reaches power plants, the strain on water intensifies. Coal-fired power stations require vast amounts of water for cooling and steam. This water is often taken from rivers, lakes, or aquifers that people and ecosystems depend on. In water-stressed regions, every drop diverted to keep coal plants running is a drop that cannot be used for drinking, growing food, or sustaining wildlife.

Burning coal also drives climate change, which in turn makes droughts more frequent and more severe. As the climate heats up, rainfall patterns shift and dry regions become drier. The same coal plants that are guzzling local water supplies are also fuelling the global changes that make water crises more likely and more intense.

The result is a vicious cycle: coal mining, washing, and burning pollute and deplete local water, while the carbon pollution from coal power worsens climate change and deepens drought. Communities at the frontlines – from Asia to Africa to Australia – bear the brunt of these intersecting crises.

There is another way. Wind and solar power offer a path out of this destructive cycle. Unlike coal, they use minimal water to generate electricity. They do not require large volumes of water for cooling, nor do they release toxic pollutants into rivers and aquifers. On top of that, wind and solar are now cheaper alternatives to coal in much of the world, making them not only cleaner but also more affordable.

Shifting from coal to renewable energy is essential to protecting water. Every coal plant replaced by wind or solar is less pressure on rivers and groundwater, fewer toxins in drinking water, and less climate pollution heating the planet. In a world where hundreds of millions already face water scarcity, ending our dependence on coal is not just a climate imperative – it is a basic matter of securing water for people and nature.
