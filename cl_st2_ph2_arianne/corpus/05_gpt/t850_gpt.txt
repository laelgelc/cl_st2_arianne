Since 2007, smartphones have transformed how we communicate, work, and access information—but this rapid technological shift has come with a heavy environmental and social cost. In less than two decades, 7.1 billion smartphones have been produced, each one relying on a complex mix of more than 60 different elements. Extracting and processing these materials has driven significant mining activity around the world, with all the associated impacts on ecosystems, water, and communities that depend on their local environment.

Once these devices are manufactured and sold, their lifespans are often shockingly short. In the United States, a typical smartphone is used for only about two years before being replaced. One major reason is design: most models do not have easily replaceable batteries. As battery performance inevitably declines, users are pushed toward buying a new device instead of simply repairing or upgrading the one they already own. This design choice locks in a throwaway culture and accelerates the rate at which devices become waste.

The scale of that waste is immense. In 2014 alone, smartphones contributed to around 3 million metric tons of electronic waste. Yet only 16% of this e-waste was recycled. The rest was landfilled, incinerated, or otherwise improperly handled, wasting valuable materials and increasing pollution. Even where recycling does occur, it is often inefficient, recovering only a fraction of the elements and energy that went into producing the devices in the first place.

The energy footprint of smartphone manufacturing is also staggering. Producing smartphones has consumed around 968 terawatt-hours (TWh) of energy—roughly equivalent to the entire annual electricity supply of India. This means that the bulk of a smartphone’s climate impact is locked in before it ever reaches a consumer’s hands. Every short-lived device, every non-replaceable battery, and every unused repair option compounds this hidden energy cost.

Inefficient recycling and poor product design are not abstract problems; they have real-world consequences that become especially clear when things go wrong. The Samsung Galaxy Note 7 recall is one example. Millions of devices had to be pulled from the market due to safety concerns, raising difficult questions about what happens to all of those materials and how much of them can truly be recovered. Without robust systems for repair, reuse, and high-quality recycling, such recalls risk turning vast quantities of resources into waste almost overnight.

All of this points to the urgent need to move away from the current linear model—where smartphones are made, sold, used briefly, and discarded—and toward a circular model that keeps products and materials in use for as long as possible. A circular approach would prioritize longer-lasting designs, easily replaceable batteries, repairability, and effective recycling that recovers a higher share of the materials already in circulation.

Companies like Samsung have a critical role to play in this transition. By redesigning their devices for durability and repair, and by investing in truly effective recycling systems, they can help reduce the pressure on mines, cut energy use, and shrink the global e-waste mountain. Public pressure is key to making this happen. Petitions calling on Samsung to improve repairability and recycling are a way for people to demand that one of the world’s largest smartphone manufacturers take responsibility for the full life cycle of its products.

The story of smartphones since 2007 shows both the scale of the problem and the potential for change. With billions of devices already produced, millions of tons of e-waste generated, and enormous amounts of energy consumed, the need to rethink how smartphones are designed, used, and recovered has never been clearer.
