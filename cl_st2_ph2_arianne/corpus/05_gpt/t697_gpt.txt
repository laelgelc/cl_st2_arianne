Commercial whaling in the 20th century pushed some of the largest animals on Earth to the brink. Armed with explosive harpoons and vast factory ships, industrial fleets repeated the same pattern of overhunting that had already devastated rhino and elephant populations on land. This relentless drive for profit left many great whale species perilously close to extinction.

By the mid-1900s, even the whaling nations themselves could no longer ignore collapsing catches. In 1946, they created the International Whaling Commission (IWC) to respond to the crisis. Initially, the IWC was dominated by countries whose economies and fleets were built on whaling, and its measures were limited and often too late. Still, it marked the beginning of an international effort to confront the scale of the damage.

One of the earliest major steps came in 1966, when the IWC banned hunting of blue whales. These ocean giants had been driven down so far that continuing the hunt was no longer defensible, even for those who had long profited from it. The blue whale ban was a turning point, signalling that some species were simply too depleted to withstand any further killing.

Over the following decades, public attitudes began to change. Graphic evidence of industrial whaling and determined campaigning helped people around the world see whales not as “resources” but as sentient beings and vital parts of ocean ecosystems. Greenpeace played a central role in this shift, using non-violent direct action and global advocacy to bring the brutality of modern whaling into public view and onto political agendas. As support for whale protection grew, the pressure on governments inside the IWC intensified.

In 1982, after years of mounting concern and activism, the IWC adopted a global moratorium on commercial whaling, which came into force in 1986. This decision is widely recognised as a landmark win for conservation and a testament to the power of sustained public pressure. For many species, the moratorium offered a critical chance to recover from decades of industrial slaughter.

Yet this victory has never been secure. From the moment the ban was agreed, it has been challenged by loopholes and ongoing efforts to weaken or overturn it. Some countries have continued whaling under various justifications, and pro‑whaling interests have repeatedly pushed to reopen commercial hunts. These pressures keep the moratorium under constant strain and highlight how fragile hard‑won protections can be.

At the same time, the threats facing whales have multiplied. Even where harpoons have fallen silent, whales now struggle against a different set of human‑driven dangers. Climate change is altering ocean temperatures, currents, and food webs, affecting where whales can feed and migrate. Pollution, including chemical contaminants, adds further stress to already vulnerable populations. Entanglement in fishing gear injures and kills many whales each year, while the spread of plastics through the oceans creates additional risks.

Protecting whales is not just about saving iconic species; it is about safeguarding the health of the ocean itself. Whales play an important role in carbon storage and nutrient recycling, helping to support marine productivity and the broader climate system. Their survival is closely tied to the resilience of the seas we all depend on.

For the IWC, this reality demands a clear focus. Debates over reopening commercial whaling divert attention and resources from the urgent work of confronting climate impacts, reducing pollution, preventing entanglement, and addressing plastics in the ocean. With whales facing a new era of overlapping threats, the IWC’s priority must be to strengthen and expand protections, not revisit the mistakes that drove these species so close to extinction in the first place.
