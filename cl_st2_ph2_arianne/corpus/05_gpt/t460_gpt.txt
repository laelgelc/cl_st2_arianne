Ezra W. Smith, the illustrator behind the Nothing Extra project, has created a new digital colouring book for Greenpeace Russia. This collection of illustrations is available for anyone who wants to download, print, and colour them in their own way.

Each illustration in the colouring book is dedicated to a specific Greenpeace activity or project. By colouring the pages, users can explore different aspects of Greenpeace’s work and engage with these themes creatively.

Accessing the colouring book is straightforward. Users simply click on the images to open a downloadable version suitable for printing. From there, they can print the pages at home or elsewhere and start colouring.

The digital format makes the colouring book easy to share and use, giving more people the opportunity to connect with Greenpeace Russia’s activities through art and creativity.
