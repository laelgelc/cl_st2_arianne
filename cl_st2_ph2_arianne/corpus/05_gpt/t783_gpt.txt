For more than a century, the car has dominated how we move through our cities. In many countries, owning a vehicle became an expectation rather than a choice: in places like the UK, the USA and beyond, high levels of car ownership have shaped everything from urban planning to air quality. Roads were widened, pavements narrowed, and public transport often sidelined in favour of private vehicles.

But a clear shift is underway—especially among younger people. Faced with the rising costs of buying, fuelling, insuring and maintaining a car, many are choosing different ways to get around. Bicycles, public transport and trains are becoming the preferred options in city after city, showing how quickly habits can change when alternatives are available and attractive.

Berlin is one example where public transport is winning out. There, people are increasingly opting for buses, trams and trains rather than private cars. In Copenhagen, cycling has become the backbone of daily life: 62% of commutes in the city are now made by bike. This isn’t a marginal trend—it’s a mainstream choice, made possible by infrastructure and planning that put people before cars.

Lyon offers another glimpse of what’s possible when a city invests in alternatives. The number of cars entering the city has fallen by 20%, while bike hire schemes and cycling have grown. London, too, has seen a significant decline in car use: car journeys in the city have dropped by 25% since 1990. These changes didn’t happen by accident. They came as cities introduced better public transport, safer spaces for cycling and walking, and policies that made driving less dominant.

Car-free days are also gaining popularity worldwide, giving people a taste of what cities can feel like when streets aren’t clogged with traffic. In Bogotá, a week-long car-free event shows how quickly public space can be reclaimed for people, not just vehicles. During these periods, streets become places to walk, cycle, and gather—demonstrating that our dependence on cars is not inevitable.

Electric cars are often promoted as the solution to pollution and climate impacts from transport. While they are a positive step compared with fossil-fuelled cars, they don’t solve the deeper problem of car dependence. Even electric vehicles require large amounts of materials and energy to produce, and they still take up the same amount of space on crowded streets and in parking lots.

Cars are fundamentally wasteful in how they use resources and urban space. On average, they sit idle about 95% of the time, consuming valuable land for parking and storage. In Los Angeles County, for example, around 14% of land area is devoted just to parking. That is space that could otherwise be used for homes, parks, schools, or green areas that make cities healthier and more liveable.

Greenpeace’s report, Freedom to Breathe: Rethinking Urban Transport, sets out a vision for a different kind of city. In this future, streets are designed around people, not parked vehicles. Safe cycle lanes connect neighbourhoods. Public transport is clean, frequent and affordable, making it the easiest and most logical choice for most journeys. Walking, cycling, buses and trains share priority, while private cars play a much smaller role.

The report underlines that truly sustainable transport is about more than switching engines. It requires building cycle lanes, offering a wide range of transport options, and investing in affordable, clean mass transit. It also means deliberately reducing our reliance on cars so that cities are no longer dominated by traffic and parking.

Where cities provide real alternatives, people change how they travel. The examples from Berlin, Copenhagen, Lyon, London and Bogotá show that when cycling infrastructure improves, when public transport is reliable and accessible, and when streets are opened up for people, communities quickly embrace new ways of moving. This is the direction that can lead to cleaner air, safer streets and cities where everyone has the freedom to breathe.
