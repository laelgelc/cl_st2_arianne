Standing on the deck of a ship in the Indian Ocean, the scale of industrial fishing is impossible to ignore. Vast nets sweep through the water, hauling up everything in their path. Alongside the tuna these fleets are targeting come dolphins, rays and sharks – dragged up as bycatch, often dead or dying. The sea, which should be alive with movement, starts to feel eerily emptied out.

These scenes are not just an environmental tragedy; they are a human one. Coastal fishing communities who have relied on the ocean for generations are now struggling with declining fish stocks. Small-scale fishers travel further, stay out longer and risk more for shrinking catches. Their livelihoods, cultures and food security are all under threat as powerful industrial fleets extract more and more from already stressed ecosystems.

Reducing demand for fish is one important part of easing the pressure on our oceans. Choosing plant-based foods and eating less seafood can help cut the footprint of industrial fishing and support planetary health. But changing individual diets alone cannot solve a crisis that is deeply structural. Billions of people depend on the ocean for food and income. Any real solution has to protect marine life while respecting the rights and needs of those communities.

That is why Greenpeace is campaigning for a Global Ocean Treaty that can turn political promises into concrete protection. The goal is to safeguard at least 30% of the world’s oceans by 2030, creating sanctuaries where marine life can recover, while ensuring the remaining 70% is managed sustainably. This means confronting destructive industrial fishing head-on: challenging tuna companies whose supply chains are linked to overfishing and bycatch, pushing to stop bottom trawling that rips up fragile seafloor habitats, and defending the rights of fishers whose futures are being sacrificed for short-term profit.

At the heart of this work is solidarity with the coastal communities on the frontlines of the crisis. Their experience of emptying seas is a warning to the rest of the world, and their knowledge and leadership are essential to building a fair and sustainable future for the oceans. Protecting marine life and standing with those who depend on it are not separate struggles – they are one and the same.
