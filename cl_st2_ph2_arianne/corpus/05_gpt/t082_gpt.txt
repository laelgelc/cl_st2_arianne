Around the world, volunteers are at the heart of Greenpeace’s work to protect the planet. They organize demonstrations, speak in public, and take part in non-violent direct actions, all driven by a shared belief that ordinary people can help create extraordinary change.

From Chile to Taiwan, volunteers are stepping forward in their own communities to confront the environmental crises they see around them. Christina, from Chile, is motivated by the growing problem of droughts and unequal access to water. Her concern for water as a basic right fuels her commitment to speak out and take action so that people and nature can both thrive.

In Korea, actor Junghoe Kim uses his public voice to draw attention to plastic waste. By engaging with Greenpeace campaigns, he highlights the scale of the plastics problem and encourages people to rethink how much single-use plastic they consume in their daily lives.

In Greece, Katerina is focused on stopping oil drilling. She participates in efforts to protect seas and coasts from the risks of fossil fuel extraction, motivated by the belief that a future built on clean energy is both necessary and possible.

Marcos, in Argentina, is driven by the realities of climate change and forest fires. He channels his concern into volunteer work that aims to protect forests and push for climate solutions, standing up for communities and ecosystems threatened by rising temperatures and more extreme weather.

In Brazil, Kely is deeply engaged in the fight against Amazon deforestation. Her volunteer work is rooted in the understanding that the Amazon is vital for biodiversity, Indigenous communities, and the global climate, and that stopping deforestation is essential for a livable future.

From Taiwan, Lu Chia-Ling focuses on marine conservation. She joins efforts to defend oceans and marine life, advocating for healthier seas and a future where marine ecosystems are respected and protected.

Each of these volunteers brings their own story, experience, and motivation, but they share a common hope: that global environmental change is both urgent and achievable. By organizing, speaking out, and taking non-violent action, they show that anyone, anywhere, can play a role in defending the planet.

Their journeys are also an invitation. By sharing what inspired them to get involved, they encourage others to become volunteers too—whether by joining demonstrations, taking part in campaigns, or supporting efforts to protect water, forests, oceans, and the climate. Together, their voices and actions form a global movement pushing for the environmental changes the world urgently needs.
