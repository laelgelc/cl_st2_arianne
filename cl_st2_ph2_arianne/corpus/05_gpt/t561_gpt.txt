Everywhere I look in this work, I see the same truth reflected back: Indigenous Peoples are on the frontlines of the climate crisis, and they are also on the frontlines of the solutions.

Across the world, Indigenous communities are fighting to protect their cultures, lands, and sacred natural elements from relentless threats — from destructive development projects to deforestation and the accelerating impacts of climate change. These struggles are not isolated; they are deeply connected, spanning continents and weaving together a shared story of resistance, care, and resilience.

In the United States, Indigenous communities are organizing to defend ancestral territories and lifeways that have been under assault for generations. In Brazil and Argentina, Indigenous Peoples are resisting deforestation and land grabs that destroy forests and biodiversity, and with them the cultures and knowledge systems that have cared for these places since time immemorial. In Cameroon and the Democratic Republic of Congo, communities are protecting their forests and homelands from exploitation. In Morocco, Russia, and Indonesia, Indigenous Peoples are similarly working to safeguard their lands, waters, and sacred sites from extraction and environmental harm.

These efforts are supported by a range of organizations and projects rooted in local leadership and grounded in community needs. Together, they form a global network of resistance and renewal, each community standing up not only for its own rights and survival, but for the health of the planet as a whole.

On the International Day of the World’s Indigenous People, we honor and celebrate these frontline activists and communities. Their work makes it clear that environmental justice and social justice are inseparable. You cannot protect forests, rivers, and oceans without also defending the rights, sovereignty, and self-determination of the peoples who have safeguarded them for generations.

Indigenous territories contain 80% of the world’s remaining biodiversity. This is not a coincidence. It is the direct result of relationships to land based on reciprocity, responsibility, and respect — relationships that have endured despite colonization, violence, and systemic attempts to erase Indigenous cultures and governance.

Climate justice is impossible without Indigenous sovereignty. When Indigenous Peoples have the authority to make decisions about their lands and waters, ecosystems are better protected, biodiversity thrives, and the planet has a fighting chance. Recognizing this is not just a moral obligation; it is a practical necessity in the struggle to confront climate chaos.

Greenpeace stands in solidarity with Indigenous Peoples and movements around the world. That solidarity must be more than words — it means following Indigenous leadership, supporting land and rights struggles, and making sure that climate solutions do not repeat patterns of dispossession and exclusion.

As part of this commitment, Greenpeace is planning a global summit on human rights and climate change. Bringing together voices from Indigenous communities and other frontline struggles, this summit will focus on the deep connections between protecting the climate and upholding human rights.

On this day, and every day, our message is simple: defending Indigenous rights is defending the planet. There is no path to climate justice that does not center Indigenous sovereignty, knowledge, and leadership.
