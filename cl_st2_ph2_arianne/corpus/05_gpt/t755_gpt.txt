Plastic pollution is everywhere. It’s in the sand beneath our feet, in the waves crashing onto our shores, and in the food and water we depend on. Beaches that should be places of beauty and life are increasingly littered with plastic bags, cups, and fragments so small they’re almost invisible: microplastics. These tiny pieces are now woven into the very fabric of our coastlines, contaminating both sand and surf.

This isn’t just unsightly waste. It’s a direct threat to a fundamental human right: clean, safe water, free from plastic. When we walk along a beach and see plastic in every direction, or learn that microplastics are turning up in drinking water and food, it’s a stark reminder that our current path is unsustainable. 2018 must be the year we commit to breaking free from plastic.

Single-use plastics are at the heart of this crisis. Designed to be used for just a few minutes, they can persist in the environment for decades or longer. Items like bottles, cups, and packaging, produced in massive quantities by companies such as Coca-Cola and Nestlé, are ending up in our oceans in staggering amounts. Once there, they don’t simply disappear. They float, sink, and fragment, choking marine life, entangling wildlife, and entering the marine food web.

This plastic doesn’t stay in the sea. It comes back to us on our plates and in our glasses. Microplastics and the chemicals associated with them are now found in drinking water and food, a constant reminder that there is no “away” when we throw plastic out. What we discard finds its way back into the systems that sustain us.

For years, we’ve been told that recycling is the answer. But recycling alone cannot solve this crisis. Over 90% of all plastic ever produced has not been recycled, and plastic production continues to rise. That means more and more waste, more pollution on our beaches, and more plastic in our bodies and ecosystems. As long as production keeps growing, we will never be able to recycle our way out of this problem.

The real solution lies at the source. Corporations must dramatically reduce the amount of plastic they produce and put into the world. That means rethinking packaging, moving away from single-use products, and investing in systems that prioritize reuse and refill over disposability. It means taking responsibility for the full life cycle of their products instead of pushing the burden onto communities, oceans, and wildlife.

People everywhere are demanding this change. Around the world, communities are standing up for their right to clean water and plastic-free beaches, calling on major companies to stop flooding the planet with single-use plastic. This growing movement is about more than waste management; it is about justice, health, and the kind of world we want to pass on to future generations.

Everyone has a role to play. You can add your voice by signing petitions that call on corporations to reduce their plastic footprint and commit to real change. In the months ahead, new tools will become available to help you take action—whether that’s tracking corporate commitments, supporting local campaigns, or pushing for better policies where you live.

2018 must be the turning point. By standing together, demanding less plastic production, and refusing to accept a future where our oceans and beaches are choked with waste, we can help break the world’s addiction to single-use plastic. The right to clean, plastic-free water is not optional. It is essential—and it’s time to defend it.
