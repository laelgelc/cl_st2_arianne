Norway is often held up as a model of environmental responsibility. The country recycles 97% of its plastic bottles and leads the world in electric car adoption. Its dramatic fjords and pristine landscapes have helped build a global image of a nation living in harmony with nature.

But behind this green reputation lies a stark contradiction. Norway is the world’s 7th largest exporter of climate-damaging emissions through its oil production. While the country promotes clean solutions at home, its exported fossil fuels are driving the climate crisis elsewhere.

This contradiction is especially alarming in light of the Paris Agreement, which aims to limit global temperature rise and avoid the worst climate impacts. Climate science is clear: we cannot afford to burn more oil if we want a safe and livable future. Yet the Norwegian government, together with the state-owned oil company Equinor, continues to open up new areas for oil drilling.

The consequences of a heating planet are already here. Recent years have seen extreme weather and climate disasters intensify around the world. Hurricane Dorian devastated communities, and massive wildfires have raged in Siberia, the Amazon, and Indonesia. These events are part of a growing pattern of climate chaos fueled by continued fossil fuel extraction and combustion.

In Norway, this tension between climate leadership and oil expansion has become a constitutional issue. Greenpeace Nordic and the youth organization Nature and Youth are appealing a lawsuit that challenges the government’s decision to allow new oil drilling. The case is based on Article 112 of Norway’s Constitution, which guarantees the right to a healthy environment for current and future generations.

The argument is straightforward: by continuing to expand oil production in the face of clear scientific warnings and escalating climate impacts, the Norwegian state is undermining this constitutional right. The lawsuit seeks to hold the government accountable for decisions that lock in more emissions and deepen the climate crisis.

This legal battle is not just about one country’s policies; it is about whether governments can continue approving new fossil fuel projects while publicly committing to climate action. It is about whether constitutional rights to a healthy environment have real power in the age of climate breakdown.

Supporters are being asked to add their voices to strengthen the case against new fossil fuel projects. By submitting statements, people can help demonstrate the broad concern over Norway’s ongoing oil expansion and its global climate impacts. These contributions aim to reinforce the demand that the Norwegian government live up to both its constitutional obligations and its international climate commitments.
