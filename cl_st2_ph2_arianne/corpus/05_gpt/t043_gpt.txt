After almost twenty years of hard-fought negotiations, governments at the United Nations have finally agreed a Global Ocean Treaty – a milestone that puts the protection of nature ahead of geopolitics.

This treaty creates a long-awaited global framework to protect 30% of the world’s oceans by 2030 through a network of ocean sanctuaries. These sanctuaries are vital for tackling the climate crisis, safeguarding food security for billions of people, and supporting the livelihoods that depend on healthy seas.

The agreement is not yet fully in force. It now moves into the technical editing and translation phase before formal adoption. But even at this stage, it represents a breakthrough that many thought might never come.

Civil society played a crucial role in pushing this treaty over the line, standing alongside governments that championed strong ocean protection. Small Island States, the G77, the EU, the US, the UK, and China were all key contributors to securing the deal. More than 5.5 million people around the world added their voices by signing petitions calling for a strong treaty, helping to keep pressure on negotiators and reminding them that the world was watching.

There is still important work ahead to turn this agreement into real protection at sea. Governments must move quickly from words to action, designating and effectively managing ocean sanctuaries under the new framework. But this moment shows what is possible when people, movements, and countries come together with a shared purpose.

The Global Ocean Treaty is a powerful reminder that collective action works – and that when enough people demand change, even the most complex, high-stakes negotiations can deliver a win for the planet and for future generations.
