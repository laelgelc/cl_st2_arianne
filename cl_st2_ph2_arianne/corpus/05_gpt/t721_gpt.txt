Oil companies are pushing ahead with dangerous pipelines across North America that threaten Indigenous rights, drinking water, wildlife, and the climate. Projects like the Dakota Access Pipeline, owned by Energy Transfer Partners, and the Trans Mountain Expansion are at the center of this problem.

The Dakota Access Pipeline violates Indigenous rights and puts drinking water at risk. Energy Transfer Partners, the company behind it, is even suing Greenpeace for $900 million in an attempt to silence criticism and resistance.

On the West Coast, the Trans Mountain Expansion project threatens already endangered orcas. Increased tanker traffic and the risk of spills could have devastating consequences for these animals and the ecosystems they depend on.

None of these pipelines can be built without money. Major global banks – sometimes called the “Dirty Dozen” – are providing the financing that keeps these toxic projects alive. Banks like Citibank and Deutsche Bank are among those enabling the expansion of oil pipelines that fuel climate change and violate Indigenous rights.

One powerful way to fight back is to go after what these banks care about most: their public image. By posting critical messages on their social media channels, people can expose their role in funding dangerous pipelines and damage their reputations. When banks see that their customers and the wider public are watching and speaking out, it increases the pressure on them to stop financing these projects.

Targeted public pressure on the “Dirty Dozen” banks can help cut off the money pipeline that keeps oil pipelines like Dakota Access and Trans Mountain Expansion moving forward. Every message that calls out their role in these destructive projects adds to the pressure to end funding for pipelines that threaten Indigenous rights, clean water, wildlife, and the climate.
