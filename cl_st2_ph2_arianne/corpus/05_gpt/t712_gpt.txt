Antarctica feels distant on a map, but for Greenpeace’s Antarctic Ambassadors, it is a vivid, living place that shows how closely connected we all are to the planet’s most fragile environments.

This diverse group of artists, actors, scientists, explorers, and others has travelled to the Antarctic to witness first-hand what is at stake. They have journeyed into the depths of the Antarctic Ocean, encountered penguins in their icy habitat, and used these experiences to engage with world leaders. Their message is simple and urgent: the Antarctic needs our help.

The Ambassadors are united behind a clear call for an Antarctic Ocean Sanctuary – a vast protected area that would be the largest in the world. Such a sanctuary would offer a vital refuge for penguins, whales, seals, and many other species that are under increasing pressure from climate change, pollution, and overfishing. By giving wildlife space to recover and thrive, a sanctuary would help safeguard the health of this unique ecosystem.

Protecting the Antarctic Ocean is not just about one remote region; it is about the stability of the whole planet. Healthy oceans play a crucial role in cycling carbon, helping to soften the impacts of climate change. They also underpin food security for billions of people around the world. What happens in the Antarctic does not stay there – events in this region ripple outward, affecting weather, sea levels, and ocean systems globally.

The Antarctic Ambassadors are calling on all of us to recognize our shared responsibility to protect Earth’s fragile places. By standing up for an Antarctic Ocean Sanctuary, they are standing up for a safer climate, thriving marine life, and a more secure future for people everywhere.
