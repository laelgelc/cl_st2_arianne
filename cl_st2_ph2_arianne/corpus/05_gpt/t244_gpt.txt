Offshore oil and gas workers are on the frontlines of the energy transition, yet their voices are too often sidelined in climate debates. Recent research from Greenpeace UK into the views of Scottish offshore oil and gas workers shows clearly that any credible climate plan must put workers’ rights, security and dignity at its heart.

The survey revealed low morale across the workforce, reflecting deep uncertainty about the future of the industry and the people whose livelihoods depend on it. Despite the central role that “Just Transition” plays in international climate discussions, only 9% of the workers surveyed were aware of the term at all. That gap between policy language and lived experience is stark – and it is a warning. If workers are not informed, included and supported, the transition risks being experienced as something done to them, not with them.

Yet the same workers also point towards the solutions. They are not asking to cling to a dying status quo; they are asking for a fair route into secure, well‑paid, future‑proof jobs. Supported retraining is a central demand – workers want clear pathways, financial backing and guarantees that new roles in the energy transition will match or improve on their current pay and conditions. They want to use their skills and experience to help build the new energy system, not be discarded as collateral damage of climate policy.

This is what Just Transition really means in practice: ensuring that the shift away from fossil fuels protects people and communities, instead of leaving them behind. It is not a side issue or a “nice to have” – it is essential to winning public support for the rapid climate action the science demands. And it is inseparable from another core principle: that those most responsible for the climate crisis must pay for the damage they have caused and for the transition we now urgently need.

The “polluter pays” principle is a matter of basic justice. Fossil fuel companies have profited for decades while driving climate breakdown. They must be held accountable – not only for the emissions that are heating the planet, but also for funding the retraining, job creation and social protections that will allow workers and communities to move into cleaner, more secure work. Workers should not be forced to choose between a liveable planet and a decent livelihood, especially when the corporations that caused the crisis continue to reap enormous profits.

This is why solidarity between environmental and labour movements is so vital. Climate justice and economic justice go hand in hand. Environmental activists standing with striking workers, and unions demanding decent, secure green jobs, are part of the same struggle: to transform our economies in a way that is fair, democratic and sustainable. When workers and climate campaigners support each other, it becomes much harder for governments and corporations to pit jobs against the environment.

That shared agenda is playing out on the global stage. At COP26, Greenpeace is calling for governments to deliver ambitious commitments that put Just Transition at the centre of climate action. That means not only cutting emissions in line with science, but doing so in a way that guarantees decent work, social protection and meaningful participation for workers and communities everywhere.

The same principles are shaping demands in the United States. Greenpeace supports efforts by the Biden administration to link climate action with job creation, including backing for the administration’s jobs plan and for the PRO Act, which would strengthen workers’ rights to organise. Unionised green jobs are a cornerstone of a fair transition – they can help build a low‑carbon economy that also tackles inequality and empowers workers, rather than entrenching precarious, low‑paid work in new sectors.

Across North Sea platforms and US industrial towns alike, the message is consistent: climate action must be about building a more just society. That means holding polluters to account, guaranteeing workers a real say and a real stake in the transition, and ensuring that the move to a cleaner energy system delivers secure, well‑paid, unionised jobs. The energy transition will reshape our world. Whether it does so fairly is up to the choices we make now – and to the strength of the alliances we build between workers and the climate movement.
