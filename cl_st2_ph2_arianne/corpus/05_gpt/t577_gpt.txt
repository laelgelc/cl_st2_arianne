The deep sea is one of the least explored places on Earth, home to fragile ecosystems, unique species, and vital stores of “blue carbon” that help regulate our climate. Yet this vast, mysterious realm is now under threat from a new frontier of industrial exploitation: deep sea mining.

Companies are racing to mine minerals from the seabed, claiming it is a “green solution” to support the transition away from fossil fuels. But this narrative ignores the serious risks to the ocean and the climate. The deep sea is not an empty wasteland; it is a living system that has evolved over millions of years. Disturbing it on an industrial scale could cause damage that cannot be undone.

Deep sea mining would involve heavy machinery scraping, cutting, and vacuuming the seabed, destroying habitats that many species depend on for survival. Because we have barely begun to understand these ecosystems, we risk wiping out species before they are even discovered. The damage could be irreversible, including the potential for extinctions.

The impacts would not be confined to the mining sites themselves. Sediment plumes stirred up from the seafloor could spread over vast distances, smothering life and disrupting feeding and breeding for marine animals. Pollution from mining operations, combined with intense noise and artificial light in the deep, could further disturb wildlife that has adapted to darkness and silence. Many deep sea species are highly sensitive to such changes and may not survive them.

These ecological threats are also climate threats. The ocean plays a crucial role in storing carbon, including in deep sea ecosystems and sediments often referred to as blue carbon. Disturbing these areas risks releasing stored carbon back into the water and atmosphere, undermining efforts to tackle climate change. Deep sea mining could also disrupt key marine processes that help regulate the climate, adding another layer of risk in an already warming world.

Despite this, companies are aggressively promoting deep sea mining as a necessary part of the clean energy transition. By branding it as a “green” or “sustainable” solution, they downplay the dangers to the ocean and the climate. But tearing up the seafloor is not a green answer to the problems created by overconsumption and waste.

There are alternatives. Rather than opening a new frontier of destruction, we can reduce demand for new minerals by improving recycling, reusing materials, and designing products to last longer and be easier to repair and recover. These approaches cut pressure on ecosystems while still supporting the shift to renewable energy and cleaner technologies.

Protecting the deep sea requires strong global rules. That is why Greenpeace is calling for a Global Ocean Treaty to safeguard international waters from destructive industries like deep sea mining. Such a treaty is essential to establish large-scale marine protection, ensure that the ocean’s health comes before corporate profit, and defend the climate-critical functions the ocean provides.

This is also a moment to build a powerful movement for healthy oceans. The choices made now will determine whether the deep sea remains a thriving, mysterious part of our planet or becomes another sacrifice zone for short-term gain. By standing together to oppose deep sea mining and support real solutions like recycling and strong ocean protection, we can help ensure that the ocean continues to sustain life and stabilize the climate for generations to come.
