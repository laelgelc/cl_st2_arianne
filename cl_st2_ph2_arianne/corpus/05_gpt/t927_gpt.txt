Supermarkets are no longer just places to buy food – they’ve become major players in the global clothing market. That means they also share responsibility for what happens in textile factories and to our clothes after we’re done wearing them. Greenpeace Germany has taken a close look at this responsibility and ranked supermarket chains on their commitments to detox their textile supply chains.

The result is a clear divide. On one side are the “Detox Losers”: Rewe/Penny, Tchibo, Coop, Edeka/Netto, Norma, Metro/Real, Interspar, and Migros. These companies have not committed to eliminating hazardous chemicals from their textile production by 2020. Their lack of action leaves toxic substances in the supply chain, with consequences for workers, local communities, and the environment where clothes are made.

On the other side are the “Detox Trendsetters,” led by Aldi and Lidl. These companies have committed to phasing out harmful chemicals from their textile production by 2020. They are banning toxic substances, publishing data on chemical discharges from their suppliers, and beginning to introduce recycling programs for used clothing. By making their discharge data public, they increase transparency and accountability throughout their supply chains.

Kaufland has now joined this group of committed companies, becoming the 33rd brand to sign up to detox by 2020. Beyond tackling hazardous chemicals, Kaufland is also committing to increase the share of durable and recyclable clothing in its assortment. This reflects a broader shift among the trendsetters: they are starting to look at the entire lifecycle of their products.

For these leading supermarkets, detox is not just about what happens in factories. They are also introducing take-back systems for used clothing and promoting fabric reuse. By doing so, they aim to reduce the environmental impact of textiles from production to disposal. These measures help keep materials in circulation longer and cut down on waste.

Consumers have a crucial role to play in this transition. By returning unwanted clothes through supermarket take-back programs, shoppers can help accelerate textile recycling and support a move away from the throwaway model. Choosing to buy from companies that commit to detox and use take-back and recycling systems is a way to push the rest of the sector to follow.
