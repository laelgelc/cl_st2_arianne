Hillary Glandon, a post-doctoral researcher, recently joined a Greenpeace expedition into the Fram Strait, a key gateway between the Arctic Ocean and the North Atlantic. Her work focused on understanding how Arctic Ocean ice conditions and ecosystems are changing, from the sea ice itself all the way down through the water column to the marine life that depends on it.

The scientific team on board, led by Dr. Till Wagner, followed a route along the 79°N latitude line. At every two degrees of longitude, they stopped to carry out detailed measurements of the water and ice. Using a Rosette device, they collected water samples down to 250 meters. These samples were used to measure temperature and salinity, as well as nutrients, phytoplankton, trace metals, zooplankton, acidity, isotopes, and currents. Together, these measurements help build a picture of how the Arctic marine environment is structured and how it may be shifting.

The team also focused on the sea ice itself. They measured ice thickness and took ice cores, which were then analyzed for salinity and biological content. These ice cores offer insight into the physical state of the ice and the life that exists within and around it.

From the ship’s bridge, Glandon kept watch for marine mammals and seabirds. Despite the long hours of observation, she did not see any. She described the environment around the ship as bright and surreal, with constant light and reflective ice creating unusual conditions. Even basic tasks could be challenging in this setting; she noted that the intensity of the light led to eye sunburn, a reminder of how extreme and demanding work in the Arctic can be.
