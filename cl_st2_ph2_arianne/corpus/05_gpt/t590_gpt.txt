Greenpeace activists are taking direct action against BP’s latest oil ambitions in Scotland’s Cromarty Firth, confronting the company’s continued pursuit of new fossil fuel extraction during a climate emergency.

On June 9th, activists boarded a BP oil rig in the Cromarty Firth and unfurled a large “Climate Emergency” banner, making clear why they were there. They occupied the rig for days, holding their position despite repeated police removals and legal pressure, including injunctions aimed at forcing them away. Their message focused on the contradiction between BP’s public climate rhetoric and its ongoing plans for new drilling, highlighting how the company invokes the Paris Agreement and green-sounding language while pushing ahead with more oil extraction.

When the rig was eventually towed out towards the North Sea, the Greenpeace ship Arctic Sunrise followed, maintaining the protest at sea. The pursuit led to an unexpected twist: instead of continuing towards the drilling site, the rig made a U-turn and headed back to Scotland. This sudden reversal underscored the impact that sustained, peaceful disruption can have, even against a major oil company.

The action at sea was matched by solidarity on land. Supporters mobilised at BP petrol stations, adding their voices to calls for the company to abandon plans for further drilling. These protests urged people around the world to stand together and increase pressure on BP to stop expanding fossil fuel extraction in the middle of a climate emergency.

Across the Cromarty Firth, the North Sea, and BP forecourts, a clear demand is being raised: BP must stop pursuing new oil and listen to the growing global call for climate action that matches the scale of the crisis.
