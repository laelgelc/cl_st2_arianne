Every year, International Women’s Day is a moment to celebrate the leadership, resilience and power of women. This year, it is also a moment to listen to the women on the frontlines of the climate and ocean crises who are calling for urgent action in Senegal.

Along the coast in places like Gandiol, Joal and Mbour, fishmeal and fish oil factories are making people sick and stripping communities of the fish they depend on for food and livelihoods. Instead of feeding local families and sustaining small-scale economies, huge quantities of fish are being ground down into industrial feed. The cost is being paid by coastal communities, and especially by women.

African women activists, including Hindou Oumarou Ibrahim, Makenna Muigai, Thando Kimora, Wore Gana Seck, Awa Traore and Fatou Samba, are raising their voices to expose what this industry is doing. They are highlighting how women are central to community life and local economies, and how the damage from these factories reaches far beyond the shoreline.

They are drawing attention to the way the fishmeal and fish oil industry harms local economies and food security, undermining the ability of families to eat and earn a living. They are warning about the impacts on marine ecosystems in a region already facing overfishing and climate change. And they are pointing to how this industry undermines progress towards the UN Sustainable Development Goals.

These women are not only sounding the alarm; they are putting forward clear demands. They are calling on Senegal’s government to shut down fishmeal and fish oil factories that are making people ill and diverting essential fish away from communities. They are urging a review of legislation so that local fish processors are protected instead of pushed aside. They are asking for policies that recognise and safeguard the vital role women play in coastal economies and food systems.

On this International Women’s Day, their call is simple and powerful: stand with the women defending their communities, their oceans and their right to a dignified livelihood. Add your voice to the demand for change, support the call to close the harmful factories, and pledge to Stand 4 Women.
