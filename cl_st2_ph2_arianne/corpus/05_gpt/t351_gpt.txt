Ten years after the Fukushima nuclear disaster, the memories remain as raw as the day the tsunami hit Japan’s coast and set off one of the worst nuclear crises in history. For many, Fukushima now sits alongside 9/11, the 2004 tsunami, and Chernobyl as a defining historical rupture: a moment when the world changed, and a line was drawn between “before” and “after.”

Yet for the people directly affected, Fukushima is not history. It is an ongoing reality. Survivors continue to live with the trauma of that day and everything that followed: the fear, the uncertainty, the mass evacuations, and the invisible spread of radioactive contamination across their homes and communities. A decade has not been enough to erase the pain or restore what was lost.

Looking back through Greenpeace’s archives from 2011 to 2019 offers a stark reminder of this ongoing crisis. Year after year, our teams documented radiation levels in multiple Japanese prefectures, returning to contaminated areas, evacuation zones, and communities struggling to rebuild. These visual records—photographs, maps, and measurements—trace how radiation has spread and lingered, long after the headlines faded.

Each image and data point is a fragment of a larger story: abandoned fields and homes; dosimeters registering elevated levels; protective suits and masks; and the faces of people forced to leave behind the places that shaped their lives. Together, they show that Fukushima was never just a single event. It is a long, unfolding disaster that continues to shape lives, landscapes, and futures.

Bearing witness has always been at the heart of Greenpeace’s work. In Fukushima, that has meant returning again and again, documenting what official narratives sometimes downplay or overlook, and amplifying the voices of those living with the consequences of nuclear power. Our archive is not just a record of contamination; it is a record of resistance to forgetting.

Marking the 10th anniversary is therefore not only about remembrance. It is a renewed commitment to ensuring that the lessons of Fukushima are not buried or diluted. The ongoing trauma of survivors, the forced displacement of communities, and the persistent radiation in the environment all point to the same conclusion: nuclear power carries risks that no society should be forced to bear.

By continuing to document, to listen, and to speak out, Greenpeace stands with the people affected by Fukushima and with all communities threatened by nuclear technologies. The story preserved in our archives is a call to action—for accountability, for justice, and for a future in which no one has to live under the shadow of another nuclear catastrophe. It is a reminder that remembering is a form of protection, and that bearing witness is essential in the struggle for a nuclear-free world.
