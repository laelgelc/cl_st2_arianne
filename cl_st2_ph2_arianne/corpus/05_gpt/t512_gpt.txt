The Amazon rainforest is under unprecedented attack. Between August 2018 and July 2019, 9,762 km² of forest were destroyed—an increase of 30% compared to the previous period, and the highest rate recorded since 2008, according to Brazil’s National Institute for Space Research (INPE). This spike in destruction is not an accident; it is closely linked to political decisions that have weakened environmental protection.

Under President Bolsonaro’s administration, anti-environmental policies have undermined the very institutions tasked with defending the forest. Inspections by IBAMA, Brazil’s environmental enforcement agency, were cut by 22%. At the same time, budgets for fire-fighting were slashed by 38%, even as fires raged across the Amazon and shocked the world. Instead of strengthening monitoring and enforcement, the government dismissed the director of INPE after the institute released satellite data that made the scale of deforestation and burning impossible to ignore.

These policies have also intensified pressure on Indigenous Peoples, who are among the most effective guardians of the forest. Their rights are being violated as invasions and violence escalate. One stark example is the murder of Paulo Paulino Guajajara, a member of the “Guardians of the Forest,” who was killed while defending his territory. His death is a tragic symbol of how dangerous it has become for those who stand on the frontlines of forest protection.

The crisis is accelerating. From August to October 2019, deforestation warnings doubled—rising by 100%. This rapid surge shows that the drivers of destruction are not being contained; they are being emboldened.

Urgent action is needed to stop this trend. Supporting the forest’s guardians—especially Indigenous communities and local defenders—is essential. Their safety, rights, and territories must be protected if the Amazon is to survive.

At the same time, people and institutions around the world can help by refusing to buy into destruction. Beef and soya linked to deforestation must be rejected. Cutting demand for products that drive forest clearing is a concrete way to reduce the pressure on the Amazon and stand with those risking their lives to protect it.
