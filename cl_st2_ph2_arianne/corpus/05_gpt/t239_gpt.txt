Net-zero has become one of the most widely used climate buzzwords in recent years, but its popularity hides a dangerous reality. Far from being a guarantee of meaningful climate action, net-zero commitments are often used as a smokescreen for delay and inaction. Many corporations and governments use these pledges to claim climate leadership while continuing to burn fossil fuels, relying on carbon offsets to “balance” their emissions on paper instead of cutting pollution in the real world.

Carbon offsets are at the heart of this problem. Rather than phasing out fossil fuels, companies and countries buy credits from projects elsewhere, frequently in the Global South, to compensate for their ongoing emissions. These schemes can displace communities, especially Indigenous peoples and local residents who depend on their land and forests for their livelihoods and culture. In practice, this means that the burden of so-called climate solutions is pushed onto those who have done the least to cause the crisis, while major polluters carry on with business as usual.

This is why the idea of “real zero” is so important. Real zero means actually phasing out fossil fuels and cutting emissions at the source, without resorting to offsets. It is about genuine, measurable reductions in pollution, not creative accounting. Real zero demands a rapid, just transition away from coal, oil, and gas, instead of betting on future technologies or distant promises that allow today’s emissions to keep rising.

A recent Greenpeace poll of 2,681 people from more than 60 countries reveals just how far public opinion has moved beyond the greenwashing narratives of net-zero and offsets. The survey shows that understanding of technical climate terms is low, which is hardly surprising given how jargon-heavy climate policy has become. But even without deep familiarity with the language, people are clear about what they want: real action.

An overwhelming 93.9% of respondents said they prefer real zero over net-zero with offsets. This is a powerful rejection of the idea that buying credits can substitute for cutting emissions. In the same poll, 81.1% of people expressed opposition to carbon offsets. The message is unmistakable: the public does not want polluters to be able to pay their way out of responsibility.

Trust is another critical fault line. A striking 97.8% of respondents said they do not trust companies that rely on offsets. This distrust reflects a growing awareness that many corporate climate plans are more about protecting reputations and profits than protecting people and the planet. When offsets are used as a license to continue polluting, they undermine confidence in climate commitments and deepen cynicism about promises from boardrooms and cabinet tables.

The poll also shows that public trust lies more with activists than with governments and corporations. People see climate activists as more credible actors in the fight against the climate crisis, especially in the wake of major international gatherings like COP26. While leaders talk about ambition and targets, communities around the world are demanding concrete steps: ending fossil fuel expansion, supporting a just transition, and putting people and ecosystems before corporate interests.

In the aftermath of COP26, the call for immediate, real action could not be clearer. The world does not need more distant net-zero pledges built on shaky offset schemes. It needs real zero: rapid, verifiable cuts in emissions and a decisive break from fossil fuels. The public is ready for this shift and is losing patience with greenwashing. The task now is to turn that demand into pressure strong enough to ensure that governments and corporations can no longer hide behind net-zero rhetoric while the planet continues to burn.
