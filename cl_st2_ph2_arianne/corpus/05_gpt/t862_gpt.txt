Thousands of people around the world have come together to send a clear message to Samsung: 4.3 million Galaxy Note7 phones must be reused or properly recycled, not simply thrown away.

In a massive show of online people power, cyberactivists launched a 24-hour tweetstorm using the hashtag #SaveTheGalaxy. The pressure was impossible to ignore, with #GalaxyNote7 even trending in Mexico during the action. From Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Mexico, the US, the UK, Germany, the Netherlands, Australia, and Colombia, supporters stepped up to demand that Samsung take responsibility for the huge mountain of devices left behind after the Note7 recall.

People didn’t just speak out online. Supporters picked up their phones and called Samsung directly to ask what would happen to the millions of returned devices. The answers they received were inconsistent and often worrying: some were told the phones would be destroyed, others that they might be recycled, and some were given no clear information at all about the company’s plans.

On the ground in Korea, Greenpeace activists took the message straight to Samsung’s doorstep. Greenpeace Korea staged a protest at Samsung’s headquarters, calling on CEO Kwon Oh-hyun to rethink how the company designs its products and to ensure that valuable materials from the Note7 are reused instead of wasted.

More than 30,000 people have already signed a petition urging Samsung to act responsibly. The momentum is growing, and the call to action is simple:

Sign the petition. Call Samsung and demand clear, responsible reuse or recycling of all 4.3 million Galaxy Note7 phones. Share the campaign with friends, family, and networks so that Samsung hears, once and for all, that dumping millions of devices is not an option.
