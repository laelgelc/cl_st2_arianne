Emma Thompson describes standing in a Kalimantan sanctuary, suddenly face to face with an orangutan. She remembers the animal’s immense strength, the speed of its movement, and the moment it grabbed her arm and refused to let go. What stayed with her most wasn’t just the fear, but the realisation that this powerful being was now completely dependent on humans for survival, after its forest home had been destroyed.

That sanctuary encounter is a direct consequence of a much larger crisis. Across Indonesia, vast areas of rainforest have been cut down or burned to make way for palm oil plantations. In just 16 years, 100,000 orangutans have been killed. They’ve been shot, starved when their food sources disappeared, buried or crushed by bulldozers, and trapped in fires set to clear land. The forests they depend on are being replaced with monoculture plantations, leaving them nowhere to go.

Orangutans aren’t the only ones at risk. The same destruction is pushing Sumatran tigers, rhinos, and elephants closer to extinction. These animals rely on intact, connected forests to find food, migrate, and breed. When those forests are carved up into plantations and access roads, their populations fragment and collapse.

This crisis is also a human one. The expansion of palm oil plantations has driven land conflicts and human rights abuses. Communities living in and around the forests have seen their land taken, their livelihoods undermined, and their rights ignored. Forests that once provided food, medicine, clean water, and cultural identity are being cleared at industrial scale.

Major global brands are deeply entangled in this destruction. Companies like Unilever, Nestlé, and Mondelez publicly promised to clean up their palm oil supply chains and end deforestation by 2020. They pledged to ensure their products would no longer be linked to forest destruction. Yet they are still buying so‑called “dirty” palm oil from suppliers that destroy forests.

Part of the problem is their reliance on the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO). These brands have used RSPO certification as proof that their palm oil is sustainable. But the RSPO has not stopped deforestation. Instead, it has too often provided cover for business as usual, allowing companies to claim progress while forests continue to fall.

Greenpeace’s campaign is calling this out and demanding real change. Emma Thompson has lent her voice to a film that tells the orangutans’ story and exposes the role of palm oil-driven deforestation. The campaign urges these global brands to stop hiding behind weak certification schemes, and to take meaningful action: to reject suppliers that destroy forests, and to cut deforestation out of their supply chains.

The message is simple and urgent. If brands like Unilever, Nestlé, and Mondelez stop buying from deforesting suppliers, they can help halt the destruction of Indonesia’s rainforests. That would give orangutans a chance to stay in their natural homes rather than sanctuaries, and offer a lifeline to Sumatran tigers, rhinos, and elephants. It would also help reduce the land conflicts and rights abuses faced by local communities.

Emma Thompson’s frightening moment in the sanctuary is just one small glimpse of a much bigger story. Behind it lies a choice facing some of the world’s most powerful companies: continue to profit from “dirty” palm oil, or help protect forests, wildlife, and people by finally turning their no‑deforestation promises into reality.
