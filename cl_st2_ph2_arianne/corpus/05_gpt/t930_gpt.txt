Alexander Skarsgård and Jack McBrayer traded soundstages for sea ice when they joined Greenpeace and Funny or Die to film a three-part mini-series, “Jack & Alex Set Sail,” aboard a Greenpeace icebreaker in the Arctic Ocean off Greenland. Their goal: use comedy and storytelling to draw attention to a very real crisis—global warming—and support the “Save the Arctic” campaign to stop fossil fuel drilling in this fragile region.

Filming on the icebreaker put the actors directly in the environment they were speaking up for. Alexander Skarsgård has spoken about hoping viewers come away with a sense of how beautiful the Arctic is, and how vital it is to protect it from becoming just another oil field. That contrast—between the stark, remote beauty of the Arctic and the industrial threat of fossil fuel extraction—is at the heart of the mini-series and the campaign it supports.

Jack McBrayer described what he saw on the voyage as “phenomenal and inspiring,” from rolling icebergs to calving glaciers and whales surfacing in the frigid water. Those moments capture why the Arctic matters: it is a place of immense natural wonder, home to unique wildlife and dramatic landscapes that are already being reshaped by a warming climate.

By pairing well-known actors with Greenpeace’s on-the-ground (and on-the-water) work, “Jack & Alex Set Sail” brings the Arctic closer to people who may never see it in person. The series uses humor and personality, but its purpose is serious: to raise awareness about global warming and build support for protecting the Arctic from fossil fuel drilling.
