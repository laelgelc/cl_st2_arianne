In the heart of Bashkortostan, the fate of a unique natural treasure has become a powerful symbol of resistance and hope.

Shihan Kushtau is more than just a limestone mountain. It is a sacred site and a rare natural formation that shelters unique and rare species. Yet this living heritage is now threatened by industrial plans: the Bashkir Soda Company wants to mine Kushtau for limestone, feeding an outdated soda production process that continues to depend on extracting and destroying natural formations instead of using modern, sustainable technologies.

Faced with the prospect of seeing Kushtau turned into a quarry, local residents and activists refused to stay silent. They organised peaceful resistance on the mountain itself, setting up protest camps and forming human chains to stop tree cutting and the installation of fences that would pave the way for industrial exploitation. Their goal was clear: to protect Kushtau from irreversible damage and defend both nature and their cultural and spiritual connection to this place.

The response from the authorities was harsh. On August 15, police raided the protest camp. Around 80 people were detained. Protesters were beaten, and journalists’ equipment was damaged. Alongside the violence on the ground, there were attempts to discredit the movement through misinformation, trying to undermine public support for those defending Kushtau.

Despite this pressure and repression, the protests did not stop. People continued to stand for the mountain, and their determination had an impact. The head of the Republic of Bashkortostan publicly promised to halt activities on Kushtau and initiate a dialogue. This commitment was not a final victory, but it showed that persistent, peaceful resistance can force authorities and companies to listen.

In parallel, Greenpeace Russia took action through legal and public channels. Complaints were filed about the violations that occurred during the dispersal of the camp and the broader threats to Kushtau. Greenpeace Russia is calling for three key steps.

First, Kushtau must receive official protected status to safeguard it from industrial exploitation and ensure that its unique natural and cultural value is preserved for future generations.

Second, all activists detained in connection with the protests must be released, and their rights respected. Defending nature and one’s homeland is not a crime, and those who stood peacefully for Kushtau should not face persecution.

Third, the Bashkir Soda Company must shift away from outdated, destructive technologies and adopt sustainable alternatives that do not rely on destroying irreplaceable natural monuments. Industry must change course so that economic activity no longer comes at the cost of living ecosystems and sacred sites.

The struggle for Kushtau is about much more than one mountain. It is about the right of people to defend their land and their future, about the need to protect unique natural territories, and about demanding that business and authorities choose a path that respects both nature and human rights.
