Greenpeace investigations into Asia Pulp & Paper (APP) and its parent conglomerate, the Sinar Mas Group, have revealed a stark gap between APP’s public commitments and what is happening on the ground.

Since 2013, nearly 8,000 hectares of forest and peatland have been cleared in concessions linked to APP and Sinar Mas. This includes around 3,000 hectares in a single concession, PT Muara Sungai Landak. These findings are especially serious because APP introduced its Forest Conservation Policy in 2013, promising to end deforestation and protect forests and peatlands across its supply chain.

APP has taken some notable steps since then. It has used the High Carbon Stock Approach to identify and conserve more than 500,000 hectares of forests, and has carried out peatland mapping as part of its restoration and protection commitments. On paper, these measures should have marked a turning point away from deforestation.

However, the evidence of ongoing forest and peatland clearance in linked concessions shows that APP has failed to tackle deforestation at the broader group level. Critical transparency issues also remain unresolved, including around the company’s wider corporate structure and its connections to suppliers and concessions where clearance has taken place.

Because of this pattern of broken promises and incomplete reforms, Greenpeace has ended its engagement with APP. The organisation has concluded that APP cannot be considered a trustworthy partner on forest protection while deforestation continues in concessions associated with its wider group.

Greenpeace will now call on APP’s customers and investors to use their leverage to demand meaningful, group-wide reforms. Where APP is unwilling or unable to deliver, Greenpeace will urge these companies and financial institutions to withdraw their support rather than be complicit in ongoing forest and peatland destruction.
