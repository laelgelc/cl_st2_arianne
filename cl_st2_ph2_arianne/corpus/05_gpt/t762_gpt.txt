The food on our plates, the paper in our printers, the clothes on our backs, and the wood in our homes all tell a story about how they were produced. Too often, that story is one of cruelty, exploitation, and destruction: animals confined in appalling conditions, workers trapped in modern slavery or unsafe factories, forests cleared for industrial agriculture, and communities poisoned by pesticides and toxic chemicals.

Choosing what we buy is not just a private matter. It is a powerful act that can either reinforce a destructive system or help shift us toward one that respects people, animals, and the planet. When we demand trustworthy, ethical sourcing, we are saying no to animal cruelty, no to slavery, no to toxic chemicals, and no to the exploitation of workers and ecosystems.

Yet the current global trade and agricultural system pushes us in the opposite direction. Massive subsidies and the market power of large corporations prop up production models based on pesticides, synthetic fertilizers, and the confinement of animals in industrial farms. These same forces drive expansion of crops like soy linked to deforestation, often at the expense of Indigenous territories and biodiverse landscapes.

Free trade agreements, particularly those negotiated by the European Union, play a central role in this harmful pattern. Deals such as the EU–Mercosur agreement are promoted as engines of growth and mutual benefit. In reality, they often undermine local farmers, erode Indigenous rights, and fuel the spread of monocultures over diverse, locally adapted crops. Instead of supporting mixed farming systems and regional food webs, these agreements reward export-oriented agribusiness and lock countries into supplying cheap raw materials.

This is not an accident; it is a political choice. The same governments that preach the gospel of “free trade” also practice protectionism when it suits powerful interests. Trade hypocrisy is everywhere. The Trump administration’s tariffs on various products showed how quickly the rhetoric of open markets can give way to aggressive protection of domestic sectors. In Europe, the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) has long channelled public money into forms of industrial agriculture that damage soils, water, climate, and rural communities, even as the EU pushes trade deals that expose small farmers elsewhere to unfair competition.

These double standards are not just abstract policy issues. They shape what is grown, how it is grown, and under what conditions people and animals live. They tilt the playing field in favour of large-scale monocultures drenched in chemicals and reliant on cheap labour, while smaller, more sustainable producers struggle to survive. They privilege deforestation-linked soy and other commodities over diverse cropping systems that could nourish both people and ecosystems.

We are constantly told that such trade deals and industrial supply chains are necessary for prosperity, that they lower prices and create jobs. But these claims ignore the real costs: the destruction of forests, the loss of small farms, the violation of Indigenous rights, and the health impacts of pesticides and toxic chemicals. The supposed benefits of “free trade” often accrue to a narrow group of corporations, while the harms are borne by farmers, workers, communities, and nature.

Challenging this system starts with what we do as individuals and how we act together. Every purchase is an opportunity to ask: Who made this? Under what conditions? What forests, rivers, and communities were affected? By checking our purchases and refusing products linked to deforestation, animal cruelty, slavery, or toxic production, we can send a direct signal through the market.

Boycotting products that drive deforestation is one concrete step. When we avoid meat, dairy, and other goods tied to deforestation-linked soy, or wood and paper that may come from destroyed forests, we reduce demand for some of the most destructive supply chains. When we choose food, clothing, and paper from sources that respect workers’ rights, animal welfare, and ecosystems, we help build the market for ethical alternatives.

But individual choices alone are not enough. The rules of trade and agriculture are written by governments, often under heavy lobbying from corporate interests. To change those rules, we need to challenge our governments directly. Writing letters to elected representatives, signing and promoting petitions, and using our votes to back candidates and parties that oppose destructive trade deals can all make a difference.

By speaking out, we can help debunk the myths that free trade agreements automatically bring shared prosperity and that industrial, chemical-intensive agriculture is the only way to feed the world. We can demand that public subsidies stop rewarding pollution, cruelty, and exploitation, and instead support farmers and producers who protect biodiversity, respect Indigenous rights, and provide safe, dignified work.

The choices we make and the pressure we apply can push governments to rethink trade agreements like Mercosur and to reform policies such as the CAP so they no longer enable destructive agriculture. We can insist that trade rules serve people and the planet, not just corporate profits.

Every checked label, every product we refuse, every letter, vote, and petition is part of a larger effort to build a fair, humane, and sustainable system. By aligning our everyday actions with our values, we help create the conditions where ethical, cruelty-free, and environmentally sound production is not the exception, but the norm.
