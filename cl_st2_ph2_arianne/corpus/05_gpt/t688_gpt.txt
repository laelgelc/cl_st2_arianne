Across Indonesia, forests are burning, rare species are disappearing, and communities are being forced from their homes—all so greedy palm oil companies can clear land and expand their plantations. The destruction is relentless: once-lush rainforests are being turned into monoculture estates, and with every hectare lost, more wildlife and people lose the places they depend on to survive.

Among the most extraordinary victims of this expansion are Papua’s Birds of Paradise. Around 40 species of these spectacular birds live in the region’s forests, famous for their dazzling plumage, elaborate courtship dances, and remarkable behaviours. For generations they have symbolised the wild, irreplaceable beauty of Indonesia’s rainforests. Now, as the palm oil industry pushes deeper into Papua, these birds face the loss of the forest homes they need to feed, breed, and display their unique traits.

But a growing movement is refusing to let these forests, and the Birds of Paradise, disappear in silence. Street artists and volunteers around the world are turning city walls into vivid, public calls for protection. In alleys, on school walls, and across urban neighbourhoods, murals are appearing that capture the colours, shapes, and movements of these birds—long plumes sweeping across brick, bright feathers exploding over concrete, and painted birds frozen mid-dance in impossible poses.

These artworks celebrate the beauty of Papua’s wildlife while drawing attention to what is at stake. By bringing the Birds of Paradise into the heart of our cities, artists are reminding everyone who passes by that the choices we make—what we buy, what we support, what we tolerate—are connected to the fate of these forests. Each mural becomes a conversation starter about burning rainforests, species loss, and the communities pushed aside by the palm oil industry’s expansion.

This is the spirit of the #WingsOfParadise movement: using creativity and public art to make distant forests feel close, and to turn admiration into action. Artists are donating their talent and time. Volunteers are helping to paint, document, and share the murals. People who may never have heard of the Birds of Paradise are stopping in the street, taking photos, and asking questions about what is happening in Indonesia’s forests.

Everyone can be part of this. If you are an artist, you can lend your skills to bring the Birds of Paradise to walls in your community. If you are a student, you can work with classmates and teachers to create murals or displays that highlight Indonesian wildlife and the threats it faces. If you are a bird enthusiast, you can help others appreciate why these species—and the forests they depend on—are so special. And as a consumer, you can use your voice and your choices to demand that companies stop driving forest destruction.

You can join the #WingsOfParadise movement by seeking out these artworks, sharing images of them, and using them as a starting point for conversations about forest protection. Talk with friends, family, and colleagues about what is happening to Indonesia’s rainforests, and why the survival of the Birds of Paradise matters. Every mural admired, every post shared, and every discussion sparked helps build pressure for change.

The burning of Indonesia’s rainforests for palm oil is not just an environmental crisis—it is an assault on some of the most extraordinary life on Earth and on the people who call these forests home. By standing with the Birds of Paradise and the communities of Papua, and by amplifying the #WingsOfParadise movement, we can help turn the tide against destruction and keep these incredible birds dancing in living forests, not just on painted walls.
