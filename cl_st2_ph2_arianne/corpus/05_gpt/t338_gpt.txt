Across Europe, people are eating less meat. This shift is driven by growing awareness of the impacts of meat and dairy on health, the climate, and animal welfare. In response, the meat and dairy industries are turning to aggressive advertising in an attempt to reverse the trend.

Instead of supporting this move away from high meat and dairy consumption, EU public money has been used to promote these products. Over the last five years, the EU has spent €252.4 million in public funds on advertising meat and dairy. This is more than has been spent on promoting fruits and vegetables.

These public funds have backed campaigns with slogans like “Love pork!” and “Become a beefatarian!”. Such campaigns gloss over the serious concerns linked to high meat and dairy consumption. They ignore the advice of scientists who are clear that reducing our intake of these products is essential to protect our health and to safeguard the planet from pandemics, climate damage, and the destruction of nature.

Rather than propping up industrial meat and dairy through marketing, public money should be used to support the transition that people across Europe are already beginning. EU funds should be redirected to promote fruits and vegetables and to back small-scale, ecological farmers who are working with nature instead of against it. Supporting these farmers and healthier, more sustainable food choices is a crucial step toward protecting people, animals, and the environment.
