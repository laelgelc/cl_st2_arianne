On Canada’s Pacific coast, Indigenous leaders and allies are coming together to resist Kinder Morgan’s oil pipeline expansion. Greenpeace is standing alongside an Indigenous-led movement that is defending lands, waters, and communities from the threat of this project.

Over two days, Indigenous leaders including Elder Ta’ah and Will George will gather with supporters to build a traditional Coast Salish “watch house.” This powerful structure is being raised in the path of construction as a place of vigilance and resistance. Rooted in Coast Salish tradition, the watch house will serve as a constant reminder that Indigenous peoples are watching over and defending their territories.

The planned pipeline would transport dirty tar sands oil to the Pacific coast, putting Indigenous lands and waters at risk. It threatens local communities and the ocean, including already-endangered orcas that depend on these waters to survive. By enabling more tar sands extraction and transport, the project would also fuel climate change at a time when the world needs to move away from fossil fuels. All of this is being pushed forward without full consent from affected Indigenous peoples.

The mobilization around the watch house is about more than stopping a single pipeline. It is a stand to protect the ocean, wildlife, and the livelihoods that depend on a healthy coast from further fossil fuel expansion. It is also a clear assertion of Indigenous rights and responsibilities to care for their territories.

Greenpeace is calling on people everywhere to stand with this Indigenous-led movement. Around the world, support is needed to challenge fossil fuel expansion and uphold the rights of communities on the frontlines. By joining this effort, people can help defend the coast, protect endangered orcas and other wildlife, and push for a safer climate future for all.
