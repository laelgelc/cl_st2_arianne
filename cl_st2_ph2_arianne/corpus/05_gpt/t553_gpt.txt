Our world is in a state of climate emergency. From the Amazon rainforest burning to rapidly melting ice caps and growing threats to our food and water, the damage is already unfolding around us. This is not a distant possibility; it is a present reality that is deepening every day we delay action.

September is becoming a defining month for people demanding climate justice and the protection of human rights. Around the world, communities are standing up to say that a safe climate is not just an environmental issue, but a fundamental human right.

On 18–19 September, the People’s Summit on Climate, Rights and Human Survival in New York is bringing together voices from across the globe to put human rights at the heart of climate action. The message is clear: climate policies that ignore people’s rights, especially those of the most vulnerable, are not real solutions. The summit aims to ensure that as governments and institutions debate climate measures, they prioritize justice, equity, and the protection of communities already on the frontlines of climate impacts.

Young people are leading some of the most powerful moments of this month. On 20 and 27 September, students are striking from school in countries across the world, timing their actions around the UN Climate Action Summit on 23 September. Their demand is simple and uncompromising: listen to the science, act at the scale of the crisis, and safeguard their future. These strikes are a call to adults in power to stop treating climate breakdown as a secondary issue and start responding as they would to any other global emergency threatening lives and livelihoods.

Science is also sharpening the alarm. On 25 September, the IPCC will release a report focused on the oceans and polar regions. These are some of the most vulnerable and least protected parts of our planet, and what happens there will shape life everywhere else. The report is expected to underline how urgently we need strong global protection for our oceans, including a Global Oceans Treaty that can safeguard marine life and help stabilize the climate system that all of us depend on.

Forests, too, are at a crossroads. The anniversary of the New York Declaration on Forests is exposing how badly many corporations are failing to meet their own commitments to end deforestation. While companies have made promises on paper, forests are still being cleared and burned, and the people who live in and depend on them are still under threat. The fires in the Amazon are a stark sign of what these failures mean on the ground: destroyed ecosystems, lost homes and cultures, and a weakened natural defense against climate chaos.

Resistance is rising in other sectors as well. At the Frankfurt Motor Show, from 11–15 September, protests are challenging a transport system dominated by polluting vehicles and industries that have delayed meaningful change for far too long. These actions are part of a wider demand to transform how we move, build, and power our societies so that they are compatible with a stable climate and clean air.

Greenpeace is working across these fronts, from global campaigning to local action. A worldwide petition is calling on governments and corporations to act in line with what science and justice demand, and to protect people and the planet before profit. In New Zealand, actions against oil drilling are reinforcing the message that there can be no new fossil fuel expansion if we are to avoid the worst of climate breakdown. These efforts, taken together with protests, strikes, and summits around the world, are building a powerful wave of pressure that decision-makers can no longer ignore.

The climate crisis is already reshaping our world. But so is the growing movement of people who refuse to accept inaction. September’s events show that when communities, students, scientists, Indigenous peoples, and activists come together, they can turn outrage into organized power.

Everyone has a role to play in this moment. Joining a march, supporting a petition, standing with those resisting fossil fuel projects, or amplifying the demands of those on the frontlines all add up. The more of us who get involved, the harder it becomes for governments and corporations to delay the urgent changes needed to protect our forests, oceans, ice caps, food, water, and shared future.
