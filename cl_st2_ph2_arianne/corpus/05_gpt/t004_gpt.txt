Across South Africa, the lights have been going out for years. Load shedding has become a defining feature of daily life since 2007, as communities, schools, clinics, and small businesses are forced to navigate rolling blackouts caused by deep-rooted mismanagement, sabotage, and corruption at the state utility, Eskom. The human cost is enormous: disrupted education, lost income, rising costs, and a growing sense of insecurity and frustration.

In this context, a different story is emerging—one of communities taking power into their own hands. Common Power’s Community Energy Accelerator (CEA) is training young professionals to design solar projects that directly respond to the energy crisis. Instead of waiting for change from the top, these young people are building it from the ground up.

Participants such as Abongile Gogo, Chitola Mufali, Avuziwe Mfeka, Lucy Mofokeng, and Luvuyo Mdepha are at the heart of this shift. Through the CEA, they are gaining the technical and practical skills needed to design solar and battery solutions that work for their own communities. For them, the energy transition is not an abstract policy debate—it is about whether families can keep the lights on, whether clinics can refrigerate medicines, and whether small businesses can stay open when the grid goes down.

A central idea running through their experiences is energy democracy. By learning how to design and plan solar systems, participants see how power—both literally and politically—can be shared more fairly. They highlight how community-based solar projects can help democratize energy access, ensuring that it is not just large companies or wealthy households that benefit from renewable technologies.

Community empowerment is another key theme. The CEA is not only about panels and batteries; it is about building local leadership and confidence. Participants are trained in business skills, digital tools, finance, and community engagement. These skills enable them to move from being passive recipients of an unreliable service to active shapers of local energy solutions. They are learning how to talk with residents, cooperatives, and local organisations about what kind of energy systems are needed and how to make them a reality.

In a country where unemployment is high and has been worsened by corruption and economic instability, the promise of job creation is particularly powerful. By developing expertise in solar project design, young professionals can open new pathways for themselves and others—installers, technicians, project managers, and community organisers. CEA participants point out that locally driven renewable projects can create work in places that have been hit hardest by the energy crisis and economic stagnation.

Independence from outages is another clear benefit they describe. Community solar and battery projects can keep critical services running when the grid fails, and they can offer households and small businesses a measure of security in the face of escalating load shedding. This is not only about convenience; it is about dignity and safety in communities that have been left in the dark for too long.

Affordability matters, too. Participants emphasise that green solutions must be accessible, not a luxury. Through the CEA, they explore ways to make solar projects financially viable and affordable, using their training in finance and business to develop models that can work in real-world conditions where many people are already struggling with rising costs.

The programme is unfolding against a backdrop of deep public mistrust, driven by years of corruption and mismanagement in the energy sector. This makes community-led approaches even more vital. When projects are designed with and for local people, and when young professionals from those communities are leading the work, it helps rebuild trust and gives residents a tangible stake in the energy transition.

A pilot collaboration with Greenpeace Africa is helping to scale this approach by training mentors who can guide community solar and battery projects. These mentors will support others to navigate the technical, financial, and social dimensions of local energy initiatives, multiplying the impact of the CEA and helping more communities take steps toward resilient, renewable power.

In the midst of crisis, programmes like the Community Energy Accelerator are showing what a just and people-powered energy future can look like in South Africa: young leaders equipped with practical skills, communities organising for their own solutions, and renewable energy projects designed not only to keep the lights on, but to share power more fairly.
