In South Africa, the reality of rolling blackouts has shaped daily life for years. Load shedding has been a constant presence since 2007, rooted in mismanagement, sabotage, and corruption at the national utility Eskom. For many communities, this has meant disrupted livelihoods, unsafe streets after dark, and the constant uncertainty of not knowing when the power will go off next.

Amid this crisis, a new generation of energy leaders is emerging. Common Power’s Community Energy Accelerator (CEA) is working to equip young professionals with the skills to design and develop solar projects that directly respond to the country’s energy challenges. Instead of waiting for top-down solutions, these participants are learning how to build bottom-up, community-based alternatives.

The CEA focuses on practical training in solar project design, but it goes well beyond technical knowledge. Participants gain skills in business development, digital tools, finance, and community engagement. This combination is crucial: it prepares them not just to design systems, but to turn those systems into viable projects that can be implemented, financed, and managed over the long term.

For participants like Abongile Gogo, Chitola Mufali, Avuziwe Mfeka, Lucy Mofokeng, and Luvuyo Mdepha, the program represents more than a career opportunity. They highlight how community energy solutions can help democratize access to electricity, putting power—literally and figuratively—back in the hands of local people. By focusing on affordable green solutions, they see a pathway to both address the immediate crisis of outages and contribute to a cleaner, more resilient energy system.

Community solar and battery projects developed through this kind of training can support independence from the grid’s frequent failures. They can help create local jobs and new enterprises, as trained developers work with residents, cooperatives, and small businesses to design systems that meet real needs on the ground. For many communities, this means the possibility of reliable power for homes, clinics, schools, and small enterprises that have suffered under years of unreliable electricity.

A pilot collaboration between Common Power and Greenpeace Africa is helping to deepen this impact. Through this partnership, developers in the CEA program receive mentorship specifically focused on community solar and battery projects. This support aims to strengthen their ability to turn training into tangible projects that can serve communities facing the brunt of South Africa’s energy crisis.

By centering skills development, community empowerment, and affordable green technologies, initiatives like the Community Energy Accelerator are helping to chart a new course. In a context defined for so long by load shedding and systemic failure, these young professionals are working to build a different kind of energy future—one rooted in local leadership, resilience, and shared benefits.
