The Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) has taken the significant step of disassociating from the Swiss-German timber group Danzer, revoking all of the company’s FSC certificates worldwide. This decision follows serious human rights violations linked to Danzer’s operations in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), and marks a clear signal that such practices are incompatible with credible forest certification.

The move comes in response to a complaint Greenpeace filed in 2011 against Danzer’s former subsidiary, Siforco, which operated in the DRC. In the village of Yalisika, Siforco was involved in illegal logging and in calling in police and military forces to suppress community protests. These protests were rooted in local grievances about logging activities and their impacts on the community.

The intervention by security forces in Yalisika led to serious abuses: people were injured, property was destroyed, there were allegations of rape, and one person was killed. These events starkly exposed the violent consequences that can accompany industrial logging in high-risk regions, particularly where communities are already vulnerable and governance is weak.

By revoking Danzer’s FSC certificates and formally disassociating from the company, FSC has acknowledged that these kinds of violations cannot be tolerated within a system that claims to promote responsible forest management. Greenpeace welcomes this decision as a necessary and important step. It sends a wider message to the timber industry and to all certificate holders that human rights abuses and illegal logging are fundamentally incompatible with FSC standards.

At the same time, this decision cannot undo the harm suffered by the people of Yalisika. The injuries, destruction, allegations of sexual violence, and the loss of life remain a painful reality for the affected community. Accountability at the certification level is only one part of the broader need for justice and redress for those directly impacted.

The situation in the DRC also goes beyond this single case. Violent conflicts around logging operations continue in parts of the country, underscoring systemic problems in how forests are exploited and how communities’ rights are respected—or violated. In this context, the Danzer case highlights the urgent need to strengthen FSC’s systems and safeguards in high-risk areas like the DRC.

Strengthening FSC in such contexts means ensuring that certification is not just a label, but a robust guarantee that forests are managed in ways that respect both people and nature. It also means closer scrutiny of operations in conflict-prone regions, stronger mechanisms to detect and respond to abuses, and a clear willingness to act when companies fail to meet core standards.

FSC’s decision on Danzer is an important precedent, but it must be part of a wider effort to ensure that logging in the DRC and other high-risk regions does not fuel violence or trample the rights of local communities.
