For decades, the North Sea oil industry has been a pillar of economic growth, generating billions in profits and government revenue since the 1960s. But this wealth has come at a steep cost. The same industry that has helped fuel economies has also fueled the climate crisis, driven marine pollution and endangered biodiversity across one of Europe’s most important seas.

The scale of pollution is stark. The North Sea has suffered levels of marine pollution equivalent to one oil tanker accident every year and one chemical accident every single day. These are not isolated incidents, but a pattern of ongoing harm that puts marine life and ecosystems under constant pressure. From the smallest organisms at the base of the food chain to iconic species and habitats, biodiversity in the North Sea is being pushed to the brink.

At the same time, the climate crisis is accelerating. Emissions linked to fossil fuel extraction and burning are driving more extreme weather, rising seas and widespread disruption. The North Sea oil industry is a major part of this problem. Continuing down this path means locking in more climate chaos that will hit vulnerable communities first and hardest, both around the North Sea and far beyond.

Workers in the fossil fuel sector are also paying the price. Job losses in the North Sea oil industry are rising, yet there is no adequate plan for a just transition. Without a clear, fair pathway into new, secure, green jobs, communities that have powered economies for generations face insecurity and decline. This is not only an environmental crisis, but a social and economic one.

In the aftermath of COVID-19, governments face crucial choices about how to rebuild economies. There is a real risk that post-pandemic recovery could double down on the same fossil fuel model that has damaged oceans, destabilised the climate and left workers and communities exposed. If recovery plans pour more public money into propping up oil and gas, they will lock in more pollution, more emissions and more inequality, rather than delivering a safer, fairer future.

Instead, the moment calls for a #NorthSeaRevolution: a bold, rapid transition to a fossil fuel-free North Sea powered by 100% renewables. This vision would mean replacing oil and gas with clean energy, creating greener, more secure jobs and protecting marine life and ecosystems. It would put workers and communities at the heart of the transition, rather than leaving them behind.

A North Sea based on renewables instead of fossil fuels would help tackle the climate crisis at its source, reduce the constant stream of pollution and give biodiversity a chance to recover. It would also allow governments to align economic policy with climate and nature goals, rather than setting them in opposition.

The choices made now will shape the North Sea – and the climate – for generations. Immediate action is needed to #BuildBackBetter by ending the era of fossil fuels in the North Sea, investing in 100% renewable energy and delivering a just transition for workers and communities. The #NorthSeaRevolution is not a distant idea; it is an urgent necessity.
