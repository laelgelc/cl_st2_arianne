Thirty years after the French government bombed the Rainbow Warrior in Auckland harbour, the memory of that night remains a defining moment in the struggle against nuclear testing – and in the history of peaceful protest.

On that night, the Rainbow Warrior was preparing to lead a flotilla of boats to protest French nuclear tests in the Pacific. Instead, limpet mines placed on the ship’s hull tore through the vessel, sinking it at its mooring. Greenpeace photographer Fernando Pereira was killed in the blast and ensuing flooding.

In recent interviews marking the anniversary, former French secret service agent Jean‑Luc Kister publicly apologised for his role in the attack. His words confirmed what survivors, activists and supporters had always known: this was not an accident, but a deliberate act of violence aimed at silencing opposition to French nuclear testing.

Greenpeace France’s executive director Jean‑François Julliard responded by underlining that the bombing did not achieve its goal. Rather than stopping the movement, the attack failed to halt the courage and determination of those opposing nuclear tests. The attempt to intimidate a peaceful campaign only strengthened global resolve to stand against nuclear weapons and environmental destruction.

Rainbow Warrior captain Pete Willcox, who was on board that night, has accepted Kister’s personal apology. At the same time, he has been clear that France as a state has never fully owned up to the gravity of its actions. Willcox has described the bombing as state‑sponsored terrorism and has challenged the idea that what followed was merely incompetence instead of indifference to the consequences of the attack.

Three decades on, the bombing of the Rainbow Warrior continues to symbolise both the risks faced by those who confront powerful interests and the resilience of movements that refuse to be silenced. The courage remembered in this anniversary is not only that of those on board in 1985, but of everyone who continues to stand up, peacefully and persistently, for a safer, nuclear‑free world.
