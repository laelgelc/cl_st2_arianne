Across the world, environmental activists and organizations are facing a growing threat that doesn’t come in the form of pollution or bulldozers, but in the form of lawsuits. These SLAPP suits—Strategic Litigation Against Public Participation—are brought by corporations and sometimes governments, and they aim to intimidate, silence, or punish people who speak out in defense of the environment.

SLAPPs are not about seeking justice. They exploit the legal system through inflated damage claims and crushing legal costs to deter public participation. Even when these cases fail in court, they often succeed in tying activists up in lengthy, expensive legal battles, sending a clear message: speaking out can come with a heavy price.

Around the world, Greenpeace and its allies have been targeted by SLAPPs for doing exactly what civil society must be free to do in a democracy: expose environmental harm, challenge destructive projects, and demand accountability.

In India, Essar filed lawsuits against Greenpeace India after protests against coal mining in the Mahan forest. The goal was not simply to respond to criticism, but to discourage resistance to a project that threatened a vital forest and the communities who depend on it. In another example from India, Tata Sons sought to force the removal of critical content—but the takedown request was denied, underscoring that public debate and scrutiny are not crimes.

In Europe, Shell attempted to secure an injunction against Greenpeace Netherlands. The company sought to restrict peaceful protest and campaigning, but the attempt failed. These efforts nevertheless reveal how powerful corporations are increasingly turning to legal tools to try to shield themselves from public pressure over their role in the climate crisis.

In Canada, the logging company Resolute filed a defamation claim against Greenpeace Canada, targeting its advocacy around forest protection. By framing public interest campaigning as defamation, such lawsuits try to recast legitimate criticism as a legal offense—again, not to win on the facts, but to drain time, money, and energy from those who speak out.

Governments have also used legal systems to suppress environmental protest. In Russia, authorities brought serious charges against the “Arctic 30,” a group of Greenpeace activists and crew members who took peaceful action against Arctic oil drilling. In Mexico, a protester involved in actions against the state oil company PEMEX faced criminal charges for taking part in environmental protest. These cases show how the same SLAPP logic—using legal threats and proceedings to chill dissent—can be deployed not only by corporations, but also by states.

Taken together, these examples reveal a pattern: powerful interests are using the courts to try to silence environmental defenders, not through winning arguments in the public arena, but by making it risky and costly to speak at all. This is a direct attack on democratic debate and the basic right of people to participate in decisions that affect their environment and their future.

To confront this, Greenpeace is calling for strong anti-SLAPP legislation. Such laws are urgently needed to protect activists, journalists, communities, and organizations from abusive lawsuits designed to shut down public participation. Anti-SLAPP measures can help ensure that the courts are used to uphold rights, not to undermine them; that criticism, protest, and advocacy remain protected; and that those who defend the environment can do so without facing ruinous legal retaliation.

Defending the right to speak out is inseparable from defending the planet. Without the freedom to investigate, expose, and challenge environmental destruction, meaningful climate and environmental action becomes impossible. Protecting environmental defenders from SLAPPs is therefore not only about safeguarding individuals—it is about safeguarding democracy itself.
