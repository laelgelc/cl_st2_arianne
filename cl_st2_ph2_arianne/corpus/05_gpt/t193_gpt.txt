The latest IPCC Working Group II report marks a pivotal moment for climate justice, and for the communities who have long been on the frontlines of the crisis. Amrekha Sharma reflects on how this report does more than catalogue climate impacts: it validates the lived realities of those who have been sounding the alarm for decades, and it recognizes that justice must be at the heart of climate action.

For frontline communities and Indigenous Peoples, the report’s emphasis on justice is a powerful acknowledgment that their experiences and knowledge are not peripheral, but essential. It affirms that Indigenous knowledge systems are critical to understanding climate impacts and shaping effective, grounded responses. This recognition challenges a history in which these voices were routinely sidelined or ignored, despite bearing the brunt of climate disruption.

The report also directly addresses the structural forces that shape climate vulnerability. It links heightened risks to inequities such as colonialism and other entrenched power imbalances that determine who is exposed, who is protected, and who gets to decide what “solutions” look like. By drawing attention to these roots of vulnerability, it underscores that climate impacts are not distributed randomly; they follow fault lines of injustice.

Intersectionality is central to this framing. The report highlights how climate change does not affect everyone in the same way, even within the same community. Marginalized groups—whether due to gender, race, class, disability, Indigeneity, or other identities—often face overlapping and compounding risks. This intersectional perspective makes clear that adaptation measures must be designed with these layered realities in mind, or they risk reinforcing the very inequalities that make people vulnerable.

In response, the report points to the need for human rights-based approaches to adaptation. That means climate responses must respect, protect, and fulfill human rights, rather than treating them as an afterthought. Adaptation cannot simply be about infrastructure or technology; it has to be about dignity, participation, and the redistribution of power and resources. This approach insists that those most affected by climate change must have a decisive say in how adaptation is planned and implemented.

Crucially, the report’s justice-centered lens has implications far beyond policy design—it also bolsters climate litigation and demands for accountability. By centering diverse knowledge systems, acknowledging historical contexts such as colonialism, and highlighting systemic inequities, it provides an authoritative foundation for communities and movements seeking redress from governments and companies that have failed to act or have actively fueled the crisis.

This scientific backing strengthens legal and moral arguments that climate inaction and harmful practices are violations of rights and justice, not just poor policy choices. It supports calls for responsibility from those most responsible for emissions, and for reparative measures that address both current harms and historical contributions to the crisis.

Sharma’s reflection underscores that the report leaves no room for delay or denial. The message is clear: continuing to ignore frontline voices, Indigenous knowledge, and the structural roots of vulnerability is no longer defensible. Climate responses must move rapidly from denial and incrementalism toward action that is explicitly grounded in justice, accountability, and human rights.

In doing so, the IPCC WGII report aligns itself with the demands of communities and movements that have long insisted that climate action and climate justice are inseparable. It affirms that addressing the climate crisis means transforming the systems of inequality that created and perpetuate it—and that this transformation must begin now.
