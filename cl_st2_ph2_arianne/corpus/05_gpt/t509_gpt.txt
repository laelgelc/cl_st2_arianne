Six months ago, I travelled with a small group of journalists to the Geraizeiros community in Bahia, Brazil. We went to listen, to learn, and to understand how agribusiness expansion is reshaping lives and landscapes in one of the country’s most ecologically important regions. What we encountered there has stayed with me every day since.

We were sitting with community members when armed men arrived, posing as police. They carried assault rifles, demanding to enter homes and community spaces. They had no warrants, no identification, and no legal documentation of any kind. Their presence was a performance of power and intimidation, designed to send a message: you are being watched, and you are not safe.

For two hours, they stayed. Their questions were aggressive, their posture threatening. Community members, already living under pressure, suddenly faced the immediate possibility of violence. Children watched from doorways. Elders stood by, tense and silent. There was no way to know what might trigger an escalation.

Eventually, the men left. Before going, they said they would be back.

That promise has echoed through the community ever since. It is not just a threat of another visit; it is a constant reminder that people defending their land and way of life are being treated as if they are criminals, while those responsible for environmental destruction move forward with near-impunity.

This is not an isolated story. The Geraizeiros, traditional peoples of the Cerrado, are experiencing a pattern of intimidation and violence closely tied to the advance of agribusiness. In this region of Bahia, companies like Agronegócio Estrondo have cleared vast areas of native vegetation to make way for industrial soya plantations. These operations have pushed into traditional territories, displacing communities and degrading the ecosystems they depend on.

The scale of deforestation is immense, but it is not just trees and wildlife that are being erased. The expansion of soya farming here has meant the loss of access to land, water, and traditional livelihoods for the Geraizeiros. It has come hand in hand with pressure, harassment, and fear. When armed men show up at a community’s doorstep pretending to be police, it is part of the same system that treats forests and people as obstacles to be removed.

The soya grown on these lands does not stay in Bahia. It is sold to global commodity traders like Cargill and Bunge, which in turn supply major fast food chains. The journey from a cleared patch of the Cerrado to a burger box or chicken nugget is invisible to most of the people who sit down to eat. But for the Geraizeiros, that supply chain is not abstract. It is the reason armed men appeared with assault rifles. It is the reason their territories are under threat.

What is happening in Bahia shows how human rights abuses and environmental destruction are deeply connected. When forests are cut down for industrial agriculture, it is almost always communities like the Geraizeiros who pay the highest price. Their homes become frontlines. Their safety becomes negotiable. Their existence becomes inconvenient to powerful interests.

The violence and intimidation they face are not random; they are linked to a model of production that prioritises cheap commodities over human dignity and ecological integrity. The soya that feeds global fast food chains carries with it stories of fear, displacement, and resistance that rarely make it onto the menu.

The people we met in Bahia are living with the daily consequences of decisions made in corporate boardrooms and along global supply chains. They are resisting the loss of their land, their culture, and their future, often at great personal risk. They should not have to face assault rifles and threats for defending their right to exist where their ancestors have lived for generations.

Their struggle demands a response that goes beyond sympathy. It requires pressure on the companies profiting from this destruction and abuse. It requires demanding that traders like Cargill and Bunge take responsibility for the impacts of the soya they buy, and that fast food chains stop turning a blind eye to the origins of the feed that fattens their supply of meat.

When we talk about changing the food system, this is what is at stake: whether communities like the Geraizeiros can live without fear on their own land, and whether ecosystems like the Cerrado can survive the relentless push of industrial agriculture. The armed men who came to that community in Bahia are one visible symptom of a much larger disease.

The Geraizeiros are standing up for their rights, their forests, and their future. Standing with them means insisting that the true cost of cheap soya and fast food is no longer hidden. It means demanding change from the companies driving this destruction and from the systems that enable them.

The fear those armed men tried to instil should instead become determination – our determination – to ensure that communities defending their land are protected, that their rights are respected, and that the food on our plates is not built on intimidation and deforestation.
