Climate justice is inseparable from social justice. When the climate crisis accelerates, it doesn’t impact everyone equally. Instead, it deepens existing inequalities and hits hardest those who have contributed the least to the problem.

Around the world, low-income countries, people of color, Indigenous Peoples, women, and people with disabilities are on the frontlines of climate impacts. They are more likely to face extreme weather disasters, growing resource scarcity, and escalating costs from loss and damage. These costs are projected to reach between 290 and 580 billion USD every year by 2030, a staggering burden for communities that already struggle with economic and social marginalization.

This reality exposes a profound injustice: those who did the least to cause climate change are paying the highest price. Meanwhile, fossil fuels remain the main driver of the crisis, responsible for over 75% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Continuing to rely on coal, oil, and gas locks in more warming and deepens the injustices already being felt.

Addressing this means rapidly and fairly phasing out fossil fuels and transforming our economies. Instead of extractive models that prioritize profit over people and nature, we need people-centered systems that protect rights, share resources equitably, and respect ecological limits. Climate justice demands that the biggest polluters—whether corporations or wealthy countries—are held accountable for the damage they have caused and the emissions they continue to produce.

In the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, the links between climate and social justice are especially visible. Rising temperatures, worsening droughts, and increasingly destructive floods are already threatening ecosystems, livelihoods, and cultural heritage. These climate impacts intensify existing social injustices, from water and food insecurity to displacement and loss of income. Greenpeace has documented how these changes are unfolding across the region, highlighting the urgent need for solutions that protect both people and the environment.

Building an equitable, sustainable future means confronting the climate crisis and systemic inequality together. Climate policies that ignore social justice will fail the people who need change most. Climate justice, grounded in accountability and a fast, fair transition away from fossil fuels, is essential to securing a livable planet for everyone.
