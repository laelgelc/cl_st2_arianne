Everywhere you look, there’s advice on what you, personally, should do to help the planet: bring a tote bag, skip the plastic straw, eat less meat, turn off the lights. At the same time, there’s a growing chorus insisting that these individual actions are meaningless in the face of global environmental crises driven by powerful industries and political systems.

This apparent contradiction leaves many people stuck. If your personal choices can’t “fix” the climate or biodiversity emergencies, why bother? But if no one changes their habits, how can we ever hope to shift the systems that created these crises?

The truth sits in the tension between those two positions: individual action and systemic change are not opposites. They are deeply connected, and we need both.

Individual choices rarely produce immediate, visible change at the global level. One person bringing a reusable bag will not stop plastic pollution. One family reducing meat consumption will not halt deforestation. But dismissing these actions because they don’t instantly transform the world misses their real power.

Personal steps can be a starting point for something bigger. They help people feel less helpless and more engaged. Changing how you eat, travel, or shop can be a way of aligning your daily life with your values. That alignment matters because it builds confidence, a sense of agency, and the belief that your actions count. Those feelings are the foundation from which people are more likely to take bolder steps, join with others, and demand change from those in power.

Individual actions also ripple outward. When someone chooses a different way of living and speaks openly about it, they can inspire others. History is full of examples where one person’s decision helped catalyse much broader movements. Figures like Rosa Parks and Greta Thunberg did not, by themselves, change laws or rewrite global agreements. What they did was act with courage in a way that resonated with countless others, helping to spark collective action on a massive scale.

This is why shaming people for taking “small” steps is so counterproductive. Mocking someone’s tote bag or plant-based meal because it won’t single-handedly stop climate change ignores the role these choices can play in building momentum. When people are made to feel that nothing they do is ever enough, they may simply give up.

At the same time, it is important not to stop at individual lifestyle changes. Personal choices are not a substitute for confronting the structures that drive environmental destruction. They are an entry point, not the end goal. The next step is to connect that sense of agency to collective efforts: joining campaigns, supporting movements, and pushing for laws and policies that hold corporations and governments accountable.

This escalation from “what I do” to “what we demand” is where real transformation happens. Systemic change is about shifting the rules of the game—how economies are organised, how resources are used, whose interests are prioritised. It means challenging the idea that endless growth and profit can come at the expense of people and the planet. It requires new ways of thinking about responsibility, power, and what a thriving society looks like.

Such shifts are not only desirable; they are essential for survival. The environmental crises we face are symptoms of deeper systems that must be reimagined. That reimagining depends on both the courage of individuals and the strength of collective action.

Personal responsibility and systemic responsibility are therefore intertwined. Individual choices can help build resilient communities, where people support each other in making changes and standing up for what’s right. Those communities, in turn, are better equipped to demand and sustain large-scale transformations in policy, industry, and culture.

The path forward is not about choosing between your tote bag and a political movement, between skipping meat and demanding corporate accountability. It is about recognising how these pieces fit together. Small steps can be seeds of something larger—if we nurture them, connect them, and refuse to let them end with us alone.

We need people who are willing to change how they live, and people who are willing to raise their voices together. We need courage in our daily choices and courage in the public sphere. Only by combining both can we hope to create the systemic shifts in mindsets and economies that a livable future demands.
