Kokoly’s story begins on the shores of southwest Madagascar, where the Vezo people have lived with and from the sea for generations. As a respected octopus gleaner, her daily life is shaped entirely by the tides, the reefs, and the fragile balance of the marine world around her. Her livelihood, like that of many Vezo, depends on what the ocean can provide.

In Vital Ocean Voices, Kokoly describes how this balance is rapidly unraveling. She speaks of extreme poverty, where every catch can mean the difference between eating or going hungry. Yet at the same time, the sea that once sustained her is changing. She remembers a coastline full of life: more fish, more sharks, and healthier marine habitats. Now, she sees fewer animals and degraded ecosystems, the result of overfishing and habitat destruction.

These changes are not abstract environmental trends; they are daily realities that shape whether families like Kokoly’s can survive. Destructive fishing practices and pollution are eroding the foundations of Vezo culture and economy, leaving communities with fewer options and greater insecurity. While global conversations on oceans and climate often focus on policies, targets, and distant negotiations, the voices of coastal communities like the Vezo are too often missing.

Vital Ocean Voices brings these perspectives to the forefront, showing how climate breakdown and marine degradation intersect with poverty and marginalisation. Through Kokoly’s experience, the film underlines how those who contribute least to environmental destruction are often those who feel its impacts first and most severely.

Women’s experiences are central in this story. As a woman gleaner, Kokoly carries responsibility not only for harvesting from the sea but also for caring for her family in a context of deepening scarcity. The film highlights how women in Vezo communities are navigating these overlapping crises, and how their knowledge and resilience are essential to any hope of recovery.

For those who want to understand more about the challenges facing Madagascar’s coastal communities, Vital Ocean Voices offers a powerful entry point. The film connects viewers with further information and resources, including the work of Blue Ventures, which is engaged with these communities and their efforts to protect marine ecosystems while supporting local livelihoods.

Kokoly’s voice is one among many along the Indian Ocean, but her story speaks to a shared reality: as destructive fishing, pollution, and climate breakdown intensify, the people most closely tied to the sea are fighting to defend both their environment and their way of life.
