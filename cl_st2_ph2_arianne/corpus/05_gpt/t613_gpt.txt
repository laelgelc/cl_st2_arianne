Plastic pollution is often portrayed through heartbreaking images of turtles tangled in bags or whales with stomachs full of debris. These images are powerful, but they tell only part of the story. The full picture is far more disturbing: plastic is harming people, especially those least responsible for the crisis, and this human toll is frequently ignored.

Plastic is not just “litter”; it is a fossil fuel product. From extraction to production to disposal, plastics are tied to the same industries driving the climate crisis. Corporations and industry groups have worked hard to keep single-use plastics in our daily lives, lobbying against regulations and pushing the narrative that recycling is the answer. But recycling has been used as a convenient distraction. As long as production continues to rise, recycling alone cannot solve the plastic crisis. Ending the flood of single-use plastics at the source is the only real way forward.

Research from Greenpeace East Asia and GAIA shows how the global plastic system is built on sacrifice zones. When China banned imported waste in 2018, plastic exports from wealthy countries didn’t stop—they were redirected. Southeast Asia became a new dumping ground for foreign plastic, and the impacts on local communities have been severe.

In parts of Southeast Asia, imported plastic waste has led to towering piles of trash that overwhelm local waste systems. With no safe way to manage this influx, open burning has become common, releasing toxic emissions into the air that people breathe every day. Nearby crops have been contaminated, undermining local food systems and livelihoods. These are not abstract environmental impacts; they are immediate threats to health, safety, and dignity in already vulnerable communities.

The injustice does not stop at national borders. In the very countries exporting their plastic waste, the burden is also pushed onto the most marginalized. Waste facilities, landfills, and incinerators are often located in low-income areas, where residents are exposed to polluted air, contaminated soil, and increased health risks. While people living near these sites bear the consequences, powerful corporations continue to profit from a throwaway model.

Companies like Nestlé and Unilever, whose products are wrapped in endless layers of single-use plastic, benefit from the status quo. Their business models rely on cheap, disposable packaging, while the true costs are paid by communities living next to waste dumps, incinerators, and polluted fields. The human dimension of plastic pollution—illness, poisoned environments, disrupted livelihoods—remains largely invisible in corporate messaging and much of mainstream media.

Plastic pollution is not just about animals in distant oceans. It is about people whose air, water, and soil are being sacrificed so that corporations can keep churning out single-use plastics. As long as production continues to grow, the harm will deepen. Addressing this crisis means confronting the fossil fuel roots of plastic, challenging the industries that defend it, and standing with the communities who are already living with its consequences.
