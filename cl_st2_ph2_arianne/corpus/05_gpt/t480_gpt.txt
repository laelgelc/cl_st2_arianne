Around the world, women are using cameras, lenses, and film to tell powerful stories about our changing planet. This International Women’s Day, Greenpeace is celebrating a group of visual storytellers whose work brings environmental crises – and the people living through them – into sharp focus.

In South Asia, Arati Kumar-Rao documents rivers and biodiversity, tracing how ecosystems are shifting and what that means for the communities that depend on them. Her images and stories follow the lifelines of the region, revealing both the richness of these landscapes and the pressures they face.

In Zanzibar, photographer Khadija Farah turns her lens on seaweed farmers confronting the realities of climate change. Through her work, the impacts of warming seas and shifting coastlines are seen in the daily lives and livelihoods of women who have long relied on the ocean.

Japanese photographer Maki Hayashida explores sustainable landscapes, highlighting how people and nature can coexist. Her work in Japan looks at what it means to live in balance with the environment and how local practices can point the way toward more sustainable futures.

Along the Mekong River, Ore Huiying focuses on the communities who call this vast watershed home. Her storytelling follows the people whose lives are intertwined with the river’s flow, capturing how environmental changes ripple through cultures, economies, and traditions.

Photographer Eva Verbeeck works across continents, documenting the climate crisis in Africa and water scarcity in the United States. Her images connect distant places through shared challenges, showing that the struggle for water and climate justice is global.

In Aotearoa New Zealand, filmmaker Sarah Grohnert turns to the deep bonds between Māori communities and the land. Her films trace relationships rooted in care, respect, and guardianship, showing how cultural connections to place are central to protecting it.

Indian director Priya Thuvassery dives beneath the surface to tell stories of coral reefs. Her work in India brings attention to fragile underwater worlds and the people working to protect them, reminding us that what happens under the waves is inseparable from life on shore.

In Mexico, filmmaker Teresa Camou Guerrero focuses on corn farmers. By following their lives and work, she highlights how agriculture, culture, and environment are woven together, and how farmers are on the frontlines of ecological change.

Photographer Tali Kimelman explores forest bathing, turning her attention to the experience of being immersed in forests. Her images evoke the emotional and physical connections people can build with trees and woodland spaces.

Finally, Morgan Trimble documents African wildlife conservation, capturing efforts to protect species and habitats across the continent. Her work sheds light on both the beauty of wildlife and the challenges of safeguarding it.

Together, these women use visual storytelling to make environmental issues impossible to ignore. From rivers and reefs to forests and farms, their work shows how climate change and ecological breakdown are lived, felt, and resisted – and how powerful it can be when women lead the way in telling those stories.
