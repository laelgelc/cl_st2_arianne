Every day, three times a day, we participate in one of the most powerful systems on Earth: the way we grow, trade, and eat food. Right now, that system is in crisis. A global, industrial, chemical‑intensive model of agriculture is damaging the health of people, undermining the livelihoods of farmers, and driving the destruction of the planet we all depend on.

This dominant food system relies on monocultures, synthetic pesticides and fertilizers, and long, fragile supply chains. It treats food as a commodity first and a human right second. The result is a model that erodes soils, pollutes water, fuels climate change, and pushes wildlife and biodiversity to the brink. At the same time, it leaves many farmers trapped in cycles of debt and dependency, and millions of people without access to healthy, affordable food.

There is another path. Ecological farming places people at the centre and works with nature instead of against it. It enhances biodiversity rather than wiping it out, and it avoids chemical inputs that contaminate our bodies and ecosystems. It is grounded in science while valuing and integrating local and traditional knowledge. This is the heart of Greenpeace’s Food and Farming Vision: a food system designed to nourish people, support farmers, and regenerate the natural world.

Ecological farming is not an abstract idea; it can be as concrete as what ends up on your plate in the morning. Think of a simple, traditional Spanish breakfast: toasted bread drizzled with olive oil, topped with ripe tomato and a pinch of salt. When those ingredients are local and organic, that meal becomes an act of support for a better food system. The bread can come from nearby grains grown without synthetic chemicals. The olive oil and tomatoes can be produced by farmers who protect soil health and biodiversity. That everyday choice connects you directly to a network of people and landscapes working to heal our relationship with food.

Individual actions like this matter. Choosing local, seasonal food supports nearby farmers and cuts the distance your food travels. Eating less meat eases the pressure on land, water, and climate, and helps shift demand away from industrial livestock systems. Reducing food waste respects the resources that went into every bite and shrinks the environmental footprint of your diet. Growing even a small amount of your own food—on a balcony, in a community garden, or in a backyard—rebuilds your connection to the land and to the effort and care behind each harvest.

But personal choices alone are not enough to transform a global system. Governments must redirect public money away from industrial, chemical‑intensive agriculture and toward ecological farming. They need to support farmers to adopt agroecological practices, protect biodiversity, and ensure that healthy, sustainably produced food is accessible to everyone. Companies, too, have a responsibility to change how they source, produce, and market food—backing ecological farming instead of propping up harmful industrial models.

Every meal is an opportunity to be part of the solution, but it is also a reminder to demand systemic change. By aligning our daily choices with the principles of ecological farming and pushing governments and companies to invest in this transition, we can move from a food system that harms people, farmers, and the planet to one that nourishes and protects them all.
