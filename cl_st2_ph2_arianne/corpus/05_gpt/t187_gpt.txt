Cold air bites through my jacket as I sit in a small inflatable boat on the grey waters of northern Denmark. In front of us looms the Seaoath – a massive oil tanker carrying 100,000 tonnes of Russian oil worth $65 million, shipped from Primorsk. We are here to block it, to make visible what so many would rather keep unseen: Europe is still buying the fossil fuels that help fund a brutal war.

For me, this is not an abstract political issue. I am Russian. I work with Greenpeace Nordic in Denmark, and every day I watch the news of the invasion of Ukraine knowing that the European Union’s daily purchases of Russian oil and gas are helping to finance the military behind it. When you know that, you cannot look at a tanker like the Seaoath as just “trade” or “energy security.” It becomes personal, painful, and impossible to ignore.

Since the war began, activists have been tracking and protesting these tankers as they move across European waters. Each ship is a floating reminder that our dependence on fossil fuels is not only a climate crisis – it is a peace and justice crisis. Every deal, every shipment, every barrel carries with it the cost of human lives and deepening geopolitical tensions.

Some say the solution is simply to switch suppliers: to replace Russian oil and gas with fossil fuels from somewhere else. But that only shifts the problem around the globe. It keeps us locked into the same dangerous system that drives conflict, inequality, and climate breakdown. I am here to say clearly: we must not respond to this war by entrenching our dependence on fossil fuels. We must use this moment to break free from them.

The real alternative is a rapid transition to renewable energy – a shift that can bring more peace, more equity, and fewer geopolitical struggles over resources. Wind, solar, and other renewables do not belong to one regime or one oligarch. They are the foundation of an energy system that can be fairer, safer, and more resilient for everyone.

To be part of this action, I travelled 26 hours by train from Slovakia to northern Denmark. That journey was long, but the distance between what our politicians say and what they do feels even longer. They speak of solidarity and peace, yet the flow of money for Russian fossil fuels continues. They promise climate leadership, yet still pour public and political capital into prolonging the fossil era.

From this small boat in the cold sea, my message to them is simple: stop importing Russian fossil fuels and accelerate a just green shift now. Not in ten or twenty years, but today. Ending these imports and investing in renewables is not only a climate necessity – it is a step toward a more peaceful and equitable world.

This is not just about Denmark, or Russia, or Ukraine. It is about all of us. The choices made in European capitals will shape lives far beyond these shores. A fast, fair transition to renewable energy can reduce the power of those who wage war and exploit fossil dependence, while giving communities everywhere a chance at a safer future.

Blocking one tanker will not end a war or solve the climate crisis. But it sends a clear signal: people are watching, resisting, and demanding better. As long as tankers like the Seaoath keep moving, we will keep showing up – in the water, in the streets, and in the halls of power – to insist on a different path.
