Staying safe and healthy during the COVID-19 pandemic can go hand in hand with protecting the environment. Simple daily choices, from how we wear masks to what we eat, can support our own wellbeing while reducing our impact on the planet.

A key step is using masks correctly. Choosing the right size helps ensure the mask covers the nose, mouth, and chin without gaps. Before putting on a mask, it’s important to wash hands thoroughly. Once it’s in place, the mask should fit snugly over the face, and touching it should be avoided as much as possible. When removing or replacing a mask, handling it by the ear loops or ties reduces the risk of contamination. Proper disposal is also crucial: masks should be thrown away responsibly so they don’t end up as litter or marine pollution.

What we eat can also make a difference. Shifting toward plant-based diets can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, as highlighted by data from the IPCC. Meals centered on vegetables, fruits, legumes, grains, nuts, and seeds are not only nutritious but also tend to have a lower climate footprint than diets heavy in animal products. Trying new plant-based recipes at home can be both a creative outlet and a way to support the climate while caring for personal health.

Staying active at home supports both physical and mental wellbeing. Cooking can become a daily ritual that encourages healthier, plant-based eating. Exercise doesn’t have to require special equipment: simple routines, stretching, or dancing in the living room can help keep bodies moving. Gardening, whether in a yard, on a balcony, or with a few pots on a windowsill, offers gentle physical activity and the satisfaction of growing food or plants.

Physical distancing remains an important measure for reducing virus spread. Keeping space between people outside the household, avoiding crowded places, and following local public health guidelines all contribute to community safety. At the same time, showing gratitude to frontline workers—such as health staff, cleaners, delivery workers, and others—acknowledges the crucial role they play in keeping society functioning during the pandemic.

Self-care is another essential part of staying resilient. Making time for rest, relaxation, and hobbies can help manage stress and anxiety. Even small routines—like daily stretching, a regular sleep schedule, or a few minutes of quiet reflection—can support mental health.

Simple adjustments at home can further reduce the risk of virus transmission. Creating “zones” in the home, such as an entry area where shoes, coats, and bags are left, can help keep potentially contaminated items separate from living spaces. Regular cleaning of frequently touched surfaces supports this effort. For households with pets, maintaining good hygiene—such as washing hands before and after handling animals, their food, or their waste—adds another layer of protection.

Wearing masks offers benefits for both personal and public health. They can help reduce the spread of respiratory droplets, which is especially important when people may be contagious without realizing it. Combined with physical distancing, handwashing, and thoughtful home practices, mask-wearing is one of several tools that work together to protect communities.

By paying attention to mask use, choosing more plant-based meals, staying active at home, practicing physical distancing, caring for pets responsibly, and looking after mental health, people can navigate the pandemic in ways that support both personal wellbeing and the environment.
