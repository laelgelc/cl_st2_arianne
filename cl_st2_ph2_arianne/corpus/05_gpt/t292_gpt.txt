Growing up on the island of Mauritius, Aurelie Hector’s life has always been tied to the ocean. As a fisherman’s daughter, she spent her childhood at sea, raised “like a boy” and learning to fish alongside her father. Those early mornings on the water were not just family time; they were her first lessons in how closely coastal communities depend on a healthy ocean — and how quickly things can change when that ocean is under pressure.

Out on the Indian Ocean, Aurelie and her father began noticing that their catches were shrinking. It wasn’t because they were doing anything differently. Larger fishing fleets were arriving and taking more from the sea, while the signs of marine depletion became harder to ignore. For the communities who rely on these waters for food and livelihoods, these changes were not abstract. They were felt in every empty net and every day when the fish didn’t come.

This deep, personal connection with the ocean pushed Aurelie toward a different path: conservation. Determined to protect the very environment that had shaped her childhood, she studied biology and earned a BSc in Biology. She then joined the Mauritian Wildlife Foundation, turning her lived experience on the water into a career focused on safeguarding marine and coastal life.

As Round Island Senior Warden, Aurelie’s work centred on protecting seabirds and restoring fragile island ecosystems. She helped shield seabird colonies from invasive species, carefully monitoring how the island’s ecosystems were changing over time. Her work did not stop at the water’s edge. She and her team removed fishing debris and cleaned plastic pollution from coastal areas, dealing first-hand with the pollution that washes up from human activity at sea and on land.

Through her story, shared in the Vital Ocean Voices series, Aurelie shows how destructive fishing, pollution, and climate breakdown are already reshaping life in the Indian Ocean. Her journey from fisherman's daughter to conservation biologist reflects both the vulnerability and the resilience of coastal communities — and the determination of those working to protect the ocean that sustains them.
