Senegal’s female fish processors are on the frontlines of a deepening crisis in West Africa’s coastal communities. Women like Jaba Diop and Fatou Samba are calling on the Senegalese government to stand with local people instead of industrial fleets that are devastating marine life and livelihoods.

Their demand is clear: in the midst of a health crisis, the government should support communities with basic needs such as cleaning and maintaining fish processing sites, rather than granting 54 new licenses to foreign industrial vessels from China and Turkey. These vessels have been implicated in illegal fishing and would further strain already depleted fish stocks.

According to assessments by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), fish stocks in the region are already overexploited. Despite this, industrial vessels continue to operate without the strict limits imposed on small-scale fishers. Artisanal fishing has been restricted to just three days a week, while large industrial ships carry on fishing without equivalent constraints.

This imbalance is hitting coastal communities hard. Around 40 million people in West Africa depend on fish for food security and livelihoods. As fish populations decline, food insecurity worsens. The COVID-19 pandemic has only intensified these pressures, reducing income opportunities and making access to food more fragile.

For women like Jaba and Fatou, the issue is not abstract. Their work in fish processing depends entirely on healthy oceans and reliable catches from artisanal fishers. When industrial vessels scoop up huge quantities of fish, there is less for local boats to land, less to process, and less income for families. At the same time, the lack of support for maintaining clean, safe processing sites exposes workers and consumers to additional health risks.

The continued expansion of destructive industrial fishing threatens both ocean health and the survival of small-scale fishing communities. In response, a petition has been launched calling on authorities to back artisanal fishers and processors, protect fish stocks, and prioritize people’s right to food and livelihoods over the interests of industrial fleets.

The voices of Senegal’s women fish processors highlight what is at stake: the future of coastal communities, the sustainability of West Africa’s fisheries, and the right of millions of people to access nutritious food from a healthy ocean.
