Everywhere we look, our lives are being wrapped in plastic. Avocados, t‑shirts, and countless everyday items are smothered in layers of single-use packaging, all in the name of convenience. But this convenience comes at a massive cost. More than 90% of plastics are never recycled, and instead pile up in landfills, clog our rivers, and wash into the oceans.

Out at sea, this throwaway plastic doesn’t just disappear. It breaks apart into smaller and smaller pieces, becoming a deadly trap for marine life. Turtles mistake plastic bags for jellyfish. Whales wash up with stomachs full of packaging. Seabirds are found with shards of plastic where food should be. Our oceans are turning into a plastic soup, and it’s choking the life within them.

This crisis is not inevitable—it’s the result of corporate decisions. Companies choose to wrap products in unnecessary plastic, even when better options exist. They profit, while the planet and its wildlife pay the price. That’s why people everywhere are standing up and saying: enough.

You can help expose this problem and push for change. When you see excessive or pointless plastic packaging—like shrink-wrapped produce or individually wrapped items that clearly don’t need it—take a photo and share it using the hashtag #BreakFreeFromPlastic. Tag the companies responsible so they can’t ignore the impact of their packaging choices.

Already, over one million people have joined this call for corporate accountability. From around the world, users are submitting photos that reveal just how widespread and absurd this over-packaging has become. These images tell a powerful story: we are drowning in plastic, and we refuse to accept it as normal.

By sharing these photos, raising your voice, and joining this growing movement, you can help make 2018 a turning point—a year to break free from pointless plastic packaging and demand that corporations clean up their act.
