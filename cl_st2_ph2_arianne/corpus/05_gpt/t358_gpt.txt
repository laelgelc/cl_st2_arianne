Far out in the tropical waters of the Indian Ocean lives a little-known giant: the pygmy blue whale. These whales are a tropical subspecies of the blue whale, smaller and lighter than their Antarctic relatives, yet still among the largest animals on Earth. Only in recent decades have scientists begun to understand just how distinct they are, and how vulnerable.

For much of the 20th century, industrial whaling relentlessly hunted the great whales. Commercial fleets drove many populations to the brink of collapse, killing so many animals that entire ocean basins were emptied of their largest inhabitants. In the aftermath of this devastation, researchers have slowly been piecing together what remains. As they’ve done so, they have discovered new subspecies like the pygmy blue whale and realised that many whales depend on highly specialised habitats and migration routes to survive.

That specialisation makes them particularly at risk. Pygmy blue whales and other whales now face a barrage of threats: deafening ocean noise from shipping and industrial activity, ship strikes on busy sea lanes, the destruction and degradation of key habitats, and the accelerating impacts of climate change on ocean temperatures, currents, and food webs. Each of these pressures chips away at already fragile populations that have not yet fully recovered from commercial hunting.

Whales are not only magnificent animals in their own right; they are also vital allies in protecting the planet. By moving nutrients through the water, helping to support plankton growth, and storing carbon in their massive bodies, whales play an important role in healthy ocean ecosystems and in the fight against climate change. Allowing them to recover is not just an ethical responsibility, but a practical step toward a more stable climate.

In 1986, after years of campaigning and mounting scientific evidence, a global ban on commercial whaling finally came into force. That decision gave many whale populations a chance to begin recovering. But a ban on hunting alone is not enough to guarantee their future in a rapidly changing ocean.

To truly protect pygmy blue whales and other species, we need large, well-enforced ocean sanctuaries where industrial activity is restricted and marine life can thrive. That is why Greenpeace continues to campaign for global ocean sanctuaries and to bear witness at sea, including through expeditions such as those undertaken by the ship Arctic Sunrise. These journeys document what is happening in our oceans and help build the case for stronger protections.

The future of pygmy blue whales, and of the oceans they help to sustain, depends on decisions being made now. By standing up for ocean sanctuaries and supporting efforts to safeguard marine life, people everywhere can help ensure that these tropical blue whales, and countless other species, have a chance not just to survive, but to recover and flourish.
