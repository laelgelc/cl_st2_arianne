Europe’s dependence on fossil fuels for transport is deepening a series of interconnected crises. The cars, trucks, ships and planes that move people and goods around the continent are not only a major driver of climate change, but also a powerful engine of inflation, energy price shocks and geopolitical instability.

Oil still dominates European mobility. This dependence makes households vulnerable to volatile fuel prices, driving up the cost of living when oil markets are disrupted. It also means that every litre burned helps fund oil-exporting regimes, including those waging destructive wars such as Russia’s. As long as transport runs on fossil fuels, Europe’s energy and security are tied to a commodity that fuels conflict and instability.

Transport is responsible for around 30% of the EU’s greenhouse gas emissions, making it one of the biggest barriers to tackling the climate emergency. The damage begins long before fuel reaches a tank. Oil extraction and refining devastate ecosystems, pollute air and water, and harm communities on the frontlines of drilling. On top of this, false solutions like agrofuels create new problems instead of solving old ones, driving land-use change and further environmental harm while failing to deliver the deep emissions cuts needed.

The current system is also profoundly unfair. Transport costs weigh heavily on household budgets, especially for people with no option but to drive because public transport is inadequate or unaffordable. Meanwhile, the companies and sectors most responsible for pollution continue to benefit from subsidies and tax breaks that keep fossil fuels artificially cheap and lock in high-carbon mobility.

Draining oil out of Europe’s transport system is essential to breaking this cycle. That means rapidly replacing car- and oil-centred mobility with affordable, reliable and accessible public transport, and making walking and cycling safe and convenient options for everyday journeys. It also means planning cities and regions so that people do not need to travel far to meet their daily needs.

Decarbonising transport by 2040 is both urgent and possible, but only if Europe avoids swapping one inefficient, destructive model for another. Simply replacing every fossil-fuelled car with another resource-intensive technology while keeping the same traffic-clogged, car-dependent system will not solve the climate, cost-of-living or energy crises. The priority must be fewer cars, less unnecessary transport, and more efficient, shared and people-centred mobility.

A fair transition is crucial. Ending subsidies and public support for the biggest polluters would free up resources to invest in clean, affordable transport and to protect workers and communities through the shift away from fossil fuels. Workers in high-carbon sectors must be supported with retraining, strong social protections and real participation in shaping the future of mobility.

Transforming Europe’s transport system is about much more than cutting emissions. It is about freeing people from the grip of volatile fossil fuel prices, breaking the link between everyday travel and war, and building a fairer, healthier and more resilient society.
