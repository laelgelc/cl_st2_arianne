Samsung Electronics has taken an important step toward tackling its climate impact by committing to 100% renewable energy use in the United States, China, and Europe by 2020. This commitment covers all of its operations in those regions, including its manufacturing factories, and follows sustained global campaigning by Greenpeace.

In South Korea, where some of Samsung’s most energy-intensive facilities are based, the company has announced plans to install onsite solar and geothermal power at its major semiconductor plants in Hwaseong, Pyongtaek, and Suwon. Samsung has also stated that it will support South Korea’s national goal of achieving 20% of its electricity from renewable sources by 2030.

Beyond its own facilities, Samsung has said it will join the CDP supply chain program next year. Through this initiative, the company aims to better understand and address climate-related risks across its supply chain.

The scale of Samsung’s energy use underlines why this shift matters. In 2016, the company consumed 16,000 GWh of energy—roughly equivalent to the entire national energy consumption of the Dominican Republic. Moving this demand away from fossil fuels and toward renewable sources is a significant contribution to the global energy transition.

At the same time, Greenpeace is calling on Samsung to fully implement these commitments and to go further. In particular, Greenpeace is urging Samsung to expand its renewable energy efforts beyond the US, China, and Europe to other regions where it operates, such as Vietnam.
