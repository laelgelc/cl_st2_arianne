The 67th International Whaling Commission (IWC) meeting in Florianopolis, Brazil, closed with a mix of hope, frustration and urgency. Throughout the week, deep divisions between pro-whaling and pro-conservation countries were on full display, but so too was a growing recognition that whales are vital to healthy oceans and that their protection is inseparable from the broader fight to defend the seas from mounting threats.

Greenpeace and many other groups were present as governments debated the future of the IWC and the fate of whales worldwide. One of the most significant outcomes was the adoption of the Florianopolis Declaration. This declaration affirms the crucial role whales play in marine ecosystems and confirms that the IWC’s primary focus must remain on conservation. At a time when whales face increasing pressures from climate change and pollution, this recognition within the IWC is a critical step, underscoring that protecting whales is not an isolated issue but part of a larger struggle to safeguard ocean health.

The meeting also saw a direct challenge to one of the IWC’s most important achievements: the moratorium on commercial whaling that has been in place for more than 30 years. Japan tabled a proposal that would have undermined this hard-won ban. Countries strongly opposed to commercial whaling stood firm, and the proposal was rejected. The moratorium survived, and with it, a cornerstone of international whale conservation remains intact.

However, the outcome was not positive on all fronts. A proposal to establish a South Atlantic Whale Sanctuary gained majority support but fell short of the required three-quarters super-majority needed to pass. This failure, despite clear backing from most countries, highlighted how entrenched opposition from a minority can still block progress on large-scale protection measures.

Despite these setbacks, the IWC’s conservation role was clearly reaffirmed in Florianopolis. The decisions taken, and the debates held, underscored the urgent need to build momentum for stronger ocean protection. As climate change accelerates and pollution continues to spread, the future of whales and the health of the oceans are tightly bound together. The meeting closed with that reality more clearly stated than ever inside the IWC, and with a renewed emphasis on pushing forward the global agenda to protect the seas and the life they support.
