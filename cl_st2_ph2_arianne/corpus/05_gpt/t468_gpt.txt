The coronavirus crisis is forcing societies everywhere to make rapid, far‑reaching choices. Those choices will shape not only how we survive the pandemic, but also what kind of world we inhabit in 2030 and beyond. At the heart of this moment is a simple but urgent question: will we use public resources to reinforce the industries that are destroying our planet, or will we redirect those funds toward public health, planetary well‑being, and a just transition to a more harmonious future?

The authors call for a clear break with business as usual. Instead of bailing out planet‑destroying industries, they urge governments to invest in systems that protect life: strong public health care, social safety nets, and economic structures that respect ecological limits. This is not just about avoiding the worst impacts of climate breakdown; it is about building a society where people and the planet can thrive together.

They warn that moments of shock are often exploited. In the confusion and fear of a crisis, powerful interests can push through measures that deepen inequality and sacrifice workers’ rights. The “shock doctrine” they describe turns emergency into opportunity for those who profit from deregulation, austerity, and extraction, leaving workers and vulnerable communities to bear the cost. The authors insist that we must refuse this path and demand accountability from leaders who would use the crisis to entrench injustice.

Instead, they argue for choices grounded in community, cooperation, and compassion. Rather than blaming or dividing people, responses to the pandemic should focus on protecting the most vulnerable, whether from illness, poverty, or environmental harm. Learning the deepest lessons of this moment means recognizing how interconnected we are, and how essential it is to build systems that are open, egalitarian, and peaceful.

The vision they put forward is one of a just transition to a world in balance by 2030. This involves shifting away from destructive economic models and toward ones that prioritize care: care for each other, care for the natural world, and care for future generations. It means designing recovery measures that reduce emissions and restore ecosystems while ensuring that workers and communities are supported, not sacrificed.

The authors also acknowledge the personal struggles so many are facing: isolation, loss, uncertainty, and fear. Amid these challenges, they highlight the countless acts of courage and solidarity that have emerged—from mutual aid efforts to frontline care—showing that people are ready to look after one another when systems fail. These acts are not side notes; they are glimpses of the kind of society we could build if we chose cooperation over competition.

At the same time, they stress the need for vigilance. Crises have a way of making the “impossible” suddenly possible. That can open the door to transformative, life‑affirming change—but it can also accelerate harmful policies if people are not paying attention. This is why holding leaders to account, scrutinizing where public money goes, and insisting on fair, democratic decision‑making are all essential.

The crossroads we face is stark. One path doubles down on extraction, inequality, and division, using the pandemic as cover to prop up industries that are wrecking the climate and exploiting workers. The other path uses this rupture as a chance to redirect public funds, rethink priorities, and move toward an open, caring, and peaceful world. The authors call on us to choose the latter: to protect the vulnerable, to learn deeply from this crisis, and to commit to a just, compassionate transition that can carry us into a harmonious future by 2030.
