Civil disobedience has always been one of the few tools available to those without conventional power to confront injustice. In his 2014 lecture at the Oxford Martin School, Kumi Naidoo framed it as essential for the weak to challenge the strong, especially in moments of deep social and ecological crisis. He linked today’s struggles to a long lineage of resistance, drawing on examples such as Gandhi, Nelson Mandela, Rosa Parks, and the Quakers to show how ordinary people have used principled defiance to expose and confront entrenched systems of oppression.

Naidoo described how this tradition of civil disobedience underpins Greenpeace’s use of non-violent direct action. The aim is not violence or destruction, but the creation of powerful narratives that make invisible harms visible and undeniable. By placing peaceful activists between industrial forces and the natural world they threaten, Greenpeace seeks to reveal what is usually hidden from public view.

He highlighted early actions that helped define this approach. In 1975, Greenpeace confronted whaling fleets at sea, positioning small boats in the path of harpoons to document and expose the brutality of industrial whaling. In 1978, Greenpeace took action against the dumping of nuclear waste at sea, again using non-violent intervention to show the public what was being done out of sight. These actions did more than disrupt individual operations; they helped shift public discourse by forcing governments and corporations to answer for practices they preferred to keep invisible.

For Naidoo, such tactics are necessary because power often corrupts and bends reality to its interests. Those who benefit from destructive systems deny or obscure the truth, whether about social injustice or ecological breakdown. He argued that this is particularly evident in the denial of realities like climate change, where powerful actors have delayed action and distorted the public conversation.

In this context, non-violent direct action becomes a way of asserting moral truth against institutionalized denial. It is not enough, Naidoo suggested, to simply explain or educate when those in power are committed to ignoring or suppressing inconvenient facts. Action is required—action that exposes lies, dramatizes the stakes, and forces society to confront what is really happening.

By linking historical movements for justice with contemporary environmental struggles, Naidoo presented civil disobedience as both a moral duty and a practical necessity. When formal channels fail and power refuses to acknowledge reality, non-violent resistance offers a way for people to reclaim their agency and insist that the truth be seen.
