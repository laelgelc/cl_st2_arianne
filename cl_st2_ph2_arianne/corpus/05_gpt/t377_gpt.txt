The deep sea is home to a vast, largely unexplored genetic treasure trove. Hidden in its darkness are unique viruses and powerful anti-viral mechanisms found in species such as sea cucumbers. These natural systems have already inspired groundbreaking medical tools on land. One of the most famous examples is CRISPR, a gene-editing technology rooted in nature’s own defense mechanisms, which is now being used to develop treatments for serious diseases and was recognized with a Nobel Prize in 2020.

This is just a glimpse of what the deep ocean holds. The genetic diversity in these ecosystems could drive future medical breakthroughs that we can’t yet imagine. Each newly discovered organism, each novel virus, and each unusual immune strategy represents potential innovations in medicine and biotechnology. Once these habitats are destroyed, those possibilities are gone forever.

Protecting the deep sea is not only a moral and scientific imperative; it also makes economic sense. Marine biotechnology, which draws on resources from the ocean for pharmaceuticals, industrial enzymes, and other high-value applications, is projected to reach USD 5.4 billion by 2027. This long-term, innovation-driven value stands in stark contrast to the short-term gains promised by deep-sea mining, which is forecast at around USD 7 billion. When we compare a one-off extraction industry to a renewable stream of knowledge and discoveries, the case for preservation becomes even clearer.

Deep-sea mining would physically destroy fragile habitats that have taken millennia to form. The machines used to scrape the seabed, the plumes of sediment they create, and the noise and light they introduce into one of the planet’s last great wildernesses all threaten to erase species and ecosystems before we even know they exist. With that loss goes the chance to discover new medicines and technologies that could save lives for generations to come.

The deep ocean beyond national borders has been recognized as the “Common Heritage of Humankind.” That means it does not belong to any one country or corporation, but to all of us—and to future generations. Governments and the United Nations now face a crucial choice: allow a destructive rush for short-term profit, or safeguard this shared heritage so that its genetic resources can continue to inspire life-changing medical advances.

We need governments and the UN to act decisively to protect the deep sea from mining, to uphold its status as a Common Heritage of Humankind, and to prioritize long-term health, knowledge, and innovation over short-lived financial gains. The future of medicine may depend on what we choose to leave undisturbed in the deep.
