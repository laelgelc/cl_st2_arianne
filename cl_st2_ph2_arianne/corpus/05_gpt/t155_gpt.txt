The vast expanses of the high seas – waters beyond any single nation’s jurisdiction – are often described as the planet’s last great wilderness. Yet today, they are under mounting pressure from multiple directions: climate change, pollution, deep-sea mining, and destructive industrial fishing. Together, these threats are pushing ocean ecosystems to the brink and endangering the people whose lives and livelihoods are tied to the sea.

Industrial fishing methods such as purse seining and bottom trawling are among the most damaging. Purse seining, which uses massive nets to encircle entire schools of fish, can rapidly deplete fish stocks and sweep up non-target species. Bottom trawling drags heavy nets across the seafloor, destroying fragile habitats and harming marine life that may take decades or longer to recover. These practices are designed to extract as much as possible, as fast as possible, with little regard for the long-term health of the ocean.

A 2018 study has shown that much of this industrial activity is not even economically viable on its own terms. Up to 54% of high seas fishing would be unprofitable without government subsidies and the use of very low-cost labour. This economic model relies heavily on cutting corners – not just on environmental safeguards, but on basic human rights.

Low labour costs in this context are not simply a matter of lower wages. They often reflect exploitative conditions for migrant fishers, including debt bondage, abuse, and extremely long working hours. A Taiwan court case involving the vessel Da Wang has brought some of these abuses to light, illustrating how workers can be trapped in cycles of exploitation far from shore and far from help. These human rights violations are not incidental; they are woven into the business model of a significant part of industrial high seas fishing.

Illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing makes this crisis even worse. Operating outside effective oversight, IUU fishing vessels can plunder fish stocks with impunity, ignore conservation measures, and conceal abusive labour practices. This shadowy segment of the industry undermines efforts to protect marine ecosystems and to uphold basic standards of decent work at sea.

Environmental harm and human exploitation are deeply interconnected in this system. When industrial fleets are allowed to overfish, destroy habitats, and operate in legal grey zones, it becomes easier for abuses against people and nature to go hand in hand. The result is a high seas economy that too often rests on depleted ecosystems and exploited workers.

Greenpeace is calling for a different path. Companies have a responsibility to ensure that the seafood they buy and sell is not linked to environmental destruction or human rights abuses. That means adopting robust ethical sourcing policies, tracing supply chains, and refusing to do business with operators that rely on harmful practices at sea or exploitation of workers.

Consumers also have a powerful role. By reducing overall seafood consumption and choosing options that come from sustainable, small-scale fisheries, people can help shift demand away from destructive industrial models. Small-scale fisheries, when well-managed, can support coastal communities while placing less pressure on fragile ocean ecosystems.

The future of the high seas does not have to be defined by overfishing, habitat destruction, and abuse. With stronger protections, ethical business practices, and conscious consumer choices, it is possible to move toward an ocean economy that respects both marine life and the rights and dignity of the people who work at sea.
