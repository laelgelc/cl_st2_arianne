Facebook’s handling of user data has revealed a deep and dangerous flaw in how our online world is being run. The Cambridge Analytica scandal made painfully clear that personal data harvested from Facebook could be weaponized to manipulate elections. This isn’t just about a single company or one shocking headline—it’s about the health of democracy, the right to privacy, and the possibility of building a green and just future.

For Greenpeace, social media has been an important tool. It helps us connect with millions of people, share stories from the frontlines of environmental destruction, and quickly mobilize supporters for actions across the globe. These platforms have enabled powerful moments of collective action that would have been much harder to organize otherwise.

But the same systems that help people organize for good are also being used in ways that undermine democratic processes. The core business model of major social media platforms depends on collecting vast amounts of data about what we read, watch, like, and share. That data is then used to micro-target advertising and messages back at us. This model doesn’t just invade privacy—it can deepen polarization by feeding people increasingly extreme or one-sided content, tailored precisely to their fears and biases.

Greenpeace is deeply concerned that this data-driven targeting has already been used to influence elections and referenda, shaping public debate in ways that are hidden from view and very difficult to scrutinize. When private companies hold so much power over what people see and how they are profiled, democracy itself is at risk.

Despite these serious problems, we are not deleting our Facebook pages. Walking away from the platform would mean cutting off vital lines of communication with supporters who rely on social media to stay informed and engaged. Instead, we are using our presence to push for change and to demand accountability—from Facebook itself and from governments that have failed to keep up with the scale and impact of these new data practices.

We believe governments must regulate how companies collect, store, and use personal data. Strong rules are needed to protect privacy, ensure transparency in political advertising, and stop the misuse of data for manipulation. Facebook, and other tech giants, must be held to clear, enforceable standards that put people and democracy ahead of profit.

Within our own work, we treat supporter data differently from the way social media companies do. Greenpeace does not sell supporter data. We are committed to safeguarding the information people share with us, and we use it only to support our campaigns, communicate with our community, and build the movement needed to protect the planet.

To help push for systemic change, we are encouraging people to take action through Avaaz, which is campaigning for stronger data privacy protections and measures to defend democratic processes from manipulation. By adding your voice, you can help increase pressure on decision-makers to act, and to ensure that the digital tools we all rely on are governed in the public interest.

The struggle for a green and peaceful future depends on strong, transparent, and fair democracies—online and offline. Protecting data privacy, challenging abusive business models, and demanding accountability from powerful tech companies are all part of that fight.
