Orpha Novita Yoshua, a young Indigenous Namblong woman from the Grime Nawa Valley in West Papua, Indonesia, brings a clear and urgent message to the global stage at COP15. In her letter to UN Biodiversity Secretary Elizabeth Maruma Mrema, she explains that the forests of Papua, Kalimantan, and Sumatra are not only rich in life, but are also central to protecting the climate and sustaining Indigenous cultures.

She warns that if these forests are damaged, the consequences will be severe: species extinction and the loss of entire cultures. For Orpha and her community, this is not an abstract risk but a direct threat to their way of life.

Orpha describes the Grime Nawa Valley as a place of extraordinary biodiversity and cultural meaning. The valley’s ecosystem is home to animals such as cassowaries and birds of paradise. Sago palms provide an essential resource, and there are sacred forests that hold deep spiritual significance for the Namblong people. These forests are not just landscapes; they are living spaces that sustain food systems, spiritual practices, and community identity.

To convey the depth of this connection, Orpha offers Elizabeth Maruma Mrema a Noken bag. This gift is symbolic: a Noken is more than an object, it represents the culture, knowledge, and resilience of her people. By bringing it to COP15, she is sharing a piece of her community’s identity and asking that it be protected along with their lands.

In her message, Orpha also raises a serious concern about the actions of palm oil company PT Permata Nusa Mandiri. She condemns the illegal clearing of land carried out without the free, prior, and informed consent of her community. This destruction is happening despite the clear importance of the forests for biodiversity, climate, and culture.

Orpha calls for the revocation of the company’s permits and highlights the lack of meaningful action from the government in response to these violations. Her appeal is both a demand for accountability and a plea for the protection of her people’s forests and future.

Her words at COP15 underline a simple but powerful truth: safeguarding biodiversity and the climate cannot be separated from respecting Indigenous rights and protecting the lands they have cared for over generations.
