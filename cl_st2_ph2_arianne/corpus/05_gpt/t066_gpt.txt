Air pollution is a global health crisis, and it is deeply unjust. An estimated 99% of the world’s population breathes air that does not meet World Health Organization guidelines. This is not a distant, abstract statistic—it shapes daily life, health, and opportunity, especially for those who are already marginalized.

Across the world, Greenpeace is working alongside communities to demand clean air as a fundamental right and to expose how pollution and inequality are tightly linked.

In India, Greenpeace India launched the “Power The Pedal” campaign to tackle both air pollution and gender inequality in transport. The campaign provides bicycles to low-wage women workers in Delhi and Bengaluru, helping them access cleaner, more affordable, and more independent mobility. By supporting women to move safely and sustainably through their cities, “Power The Pedal” connects climate-friendly transport with everyday empowerment.

The campaign also took aim at the policies that allow dangerous air quality to persist. Greenpeace India delivered a petition calling for revised air quality standards, accompanied by an art installation that made the invisible crisis of air pollution visible in a powerful, public way.

In Indonesia, Greenpeace supported citizens in a landmark effort to defend their right to breathe clean air in Jakarta. This work contributed to a successful lawsuit that upheld the right to clean air—a crucial step in holding authorities accountable for protecting people’s health in one of the world’s most polluted megacities.

In Malaysia, Greenpeace has pushed for stronger legal protections and public awareness around air pollution. They filed a human rights complaint to highlight how poor air quality violates basic rights. Murals and art installations brought the issue into public spaces, turning city walls and streets into calls for justice. A banner demanding a Clean Air Act made the demand clear: people need and deserve a law that guarantees their right to clean air.

In Colombia, Greenpeace used a clean air capsule in Bogotá to dramatize the reality of pollution in the city. The capsule highlighted what is usually invisible—the air people breathe every day—turning it into a tangible experience that cannot be ignored.

These efforts, from Delhi to Jakarta, Kuala Lumpur to Bogotá, share a common message: air quality is an equity issue. The people most exposed to dirty air are often those with the least power to avoid it—low-wage workers, women, and communities already facing social and economic exclusion. Clean air is not just an environmental goal; it is a matter of justice, health, and human rights.

By supporting grassroots initiatives, legal actions, public art, and policy demands, Greenpeace and communities around the world are pushing for a future in which everyone, everywhere, can breathe safely.
