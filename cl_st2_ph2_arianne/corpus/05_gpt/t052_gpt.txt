The climate crisis is reshaping lives and livelihoods across Indonesia, and coffee farmers are on the frontlines of these changes. Increasing rainfall and more frequent floods are disrupting coffee production, threatening both the quality of the beans and the stability of the communities that depend on them.

In Indonesia, small-scale producers manage around 90% of coffee plantations. These farmers are particularly vulnerable to climate impacts because even small changes in weather patterns can have outsized effects on their crops and income. Excessive rainfall can affect how coffee trees grow, alter the sweetness of the beans, and make the drying process more difficult. When beans don’t dry properly, their quality drops, and so does the price farmers can earn.

In Central Java, one women-run coffee plantation is showing how communities can respond to these challenges with solutions that are both climate-friendly and empowering. Lady Farmer Coffee was founded in 2016 by Wiwi and two other women. On their plantation, they cultivate 273 Sigarar Utang coffee trees and oversee every stage of production—from the trees to the final product. Their work is not only about producing coffee; it is about strengthening the role of women in an industry where they are often under-recognized, despite being deeply involved in farming and processing.

As rainfall has increased, Lady Farmer Coffee has faced many of the same problems affecting farmers across the country. Too much rain has interfered with the growth of their coffee trees and reduced the sweetness of the beans. It has also made drying the beans more difficult and time-consuming, which in turn threatens the overall quality of their coffee. At the same time, rising electricity prices have pushed up the costs of using conventional drying equipment, creating additional pressure on their already climate-stressed operation.

In response, Lady Farmer Coffee turned to renewable energy. Through the Diversity Movement—which includes Greenpeace Indonesia—they installed solar panels to power their production. This shift has brought concrete, measurable benefits. Solar-powered drying has reduced drying time by 40%, helping them better cope with wetter conditions and unpredictable weather. It has also cut their energy costs by 35%, easing financial pressures at a time when climate impacts are already making coffee production more challenging.

By switching to solar, Lady Farmer Coffee is also helping reduce emissions from their operations. This means their coffee is not only more resilient to climate change, but part of the solution to it. At the same time, they are maintaining the quality of their beans, showing that climate-friendly practices and high-quality production can go hand in hand.

Lady Farmer Coffee’s story is about more than technology. It highlights how women farmers are leading the way in adapting to the climate crisis, protecting their crops, and promoting renewable energy in their communities. Their experience shows that with the right support and tools, small-scale producers can confront the climate crisis while strengthening their role in the industry and safeguarding their livelihoods for the future.
