As forests burn, ice melts, and communities are torn apart by floods, droughts, and storms, governments are pouring billions of euros of public money into one of the most polluting industries on the planet: aviation. This is happening in the middle of a global pandemic and a deep social crisis, at a time when every euro of public funding should be helping to protect people, rebuild fairer societies, and tackle the climate emergency.

Instead, governments across Europe have chosen to bail out airlines with almost no meaningful environmental or social conditions attached. Around €30 billion in EU bailouts has been handed to airlines, propping up a business model that depends on fossil fuels and ever-growing numbers of flights. These decisions are not neutral. They lock us into a high‑carbon future precisely when science and justice demand the opposite.

Aviation is one of the fastest‑growing sources of CO₂ emissions. Between 2013 and 2018, emissions from the sector rose by 26%. While other sectors are being told to decarbonise, the airline industry has been allowed to expand, shielded by political choices that favour flying over cleaner alternatives. The result is a transport system that pushes people towards the most climate‑damaging option and punishes those who try to choose better.

A key driver of this injustice is the way the market is distorted in aviation’s favour. Airlines benefit from tax exemptions on kerosene and flight tickets, making flying artificially cheap. At the same time, railways – a far cleaner way to travel – are burdened with high taxes and charges. When governments exempt airlines from paying their fair share while overtaxing rail, they are effectively subsidising pollution and penalising climate‑friendly choices.

In the context of COVID‑19, this distorted system has become even more indefensible. As a second wave hits and public budgets are stretched to the limit, governments are still funnelling money into an industry that fuels both the climate crisis and social inequality. Many of the workers in aviation face an uncertain future, while executives and shareholders are shielded. Public money is being used to preserve the old, fragile model instead of funding a fair and sustainable transition.

What is needed is not more unconditional bailouts, but a radical change of course. Public funds must be redirected away from polluting industries and into green, accessible transport systems that serve people and the planet. That means massive investment in railways, especially cross‑border and night trains; in safe, extensive cycling infrastructure; in walkable cities; and in reliable, affordable public transport. These are the solutions that cut emissions, create good jobs, and reduce inequality.

At the same time, governments must commit to drastically reducing flights. This includes phasing out short‑haul routes where good rail alternatives exist, instead of propping them up with subsidies and tax breaks. Rather than chasing a return to pre‑crisis levels of air traffic, policy should be guided by climate science and public health, aiming to shrink the sector in a planned and fair way.

A just transition for aviation workers has to be at the heart of this shift. The people who keep planes flying today should not be the ones to pay the price for political failure tomorrow. Public support must come with strong protections for workers, retraining opportunities, and pathways into new, sustainable jobs in rail, public transport, renewable energy, and other green sectors. Bailouts that protect corporate profits while leaving workers exposed are not acceptable.

The overlapping crises of climate breakdown, COVID‑19, and social injustice demand courage and clarity from governments. Continuing to pour public money into the airline industry with minimal conditions is a choice to deepen those crises. Redirecting that money into green transport, cutting unnecessary flights, and guaranteeing a just transition is a choice to protect people, climate, and future generations.

Right now, governments are choosing the wrong side. It’s time they stopped bankrolling pollution and started investing in the fair, clean transport systems we urgently need.
