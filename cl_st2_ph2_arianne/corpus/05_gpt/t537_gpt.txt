Around the world, people are taking action in the face of the climate emergency, and a recent Greenpeace live blog has been documenting this growing wave of resistance and demands for change.

The blog highlights how the latest IPCC report on oceans and the cryosphere has intensified calls for accelerated climate action. The science underlines the urgency: what happens now to our oceans, ice sheets, and frozen regions will shape the lives of billions, and campaigners are using this evidence to press governments and corporations to move faster and further.

On the streets, actions are unfolding across continents. In Lebanon, activists have used graffiti to make the climate crisis visible in everyday public spaces, turning walls into messages that demand attention and accountability. At the global level, Greenpeace has been tracking responses to the UN Climate Action Summit, where governments are under pressure to turn promises into real, measurable cuts in emissions.

Direct actions against fossil fuels feature prominently. In the Philippines, campaigners have taken part in blockades targeting Shell, calling out the role of major oil companies in driving the climate crisis. In Poland, activists have blocked coal operations, challenging one of Europe’s most entrenched fossil fuel sectors and demanding a transition away from coal.

In cities and infrastructure hubs, climbers have scaled structures to confront powerful brands and industries. In London, they have targeted Burger King, connecting fast food supply chains to deforestation and climate destruction. In Texas, climbers have taken action on a bridge, drawing attention to fossil fuel dependence and the need to rethink the systems that lock societies into high-carbon pathways.

Across Sweden and the Netherlands, banners have appeared in prominent locations, carrying clear messages that governments and corporations must act in line with climate science. These visual interventions are part of a broader tapestry of public pressure that refuses to let leaders ignore the crisis.

The blog also reports on a car industry emissions report in Germany, underscoring how the transport sector remains a major driver of climate pollution. By shining a light on the gap between carmakers’ green claims and their actual emissions, campaigners are pushing for stronger regulations and a rapid shift away from high-emitting vehicles.

All of this is happening alongside huge, coordinated climate strikes. Millions of people have taken to the streets, led by young people but joined by communities of all ages, to demand an end to fossil fuels and a just transition to a safer future. These mass mobilisations are amplifying voices that have long been ignored, especially those on the frontlines of climate impacts.

Indigenous leaders and communities are central in these mobilisations, issuing declarations that link climate justice with Indigenous rights, land protection, and self-determination. Their calls emphasise that any real solution to the climate crisis must address historical injustices and respect Indigenous knowledge and leadership.

The live blog also follows campaigns targeting companies whose supply chains are linked to deforestation, including major fast food corporations. By exposing how products on supermarket shelves and fast food menus can be tied to destroyed forests, activists are demanding that companies cut deforestation out of their operations and take responsibility for the climate damage they cause.

Taken together, the actions documented in the Greenpeace live blog show a world that is no longer willing to accept business as usual. From scientific warnings about oceans and ice, to blockades, strikes, Indigenous declarations, and campaigns against destructive industries, people everywhere are insisting that the climate emergency be treated like the true global crisis it is.
