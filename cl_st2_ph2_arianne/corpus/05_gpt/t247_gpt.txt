In the Philippines, a different kind of food system has been quietly taking root since 2011. The Good Food Community, founded by Charlene Tan, is a social enterprise that brings smallholder organic farmers together with households in Metro Manila through a Community Shared Agriculture (CSA) model.

Instead of buying vegetables piecemeal from a supermarket, consumers subscribe and prepay for weekly shares of fresh produce. This simple shift helps redistribute power and risk across the food chain. Farmers gain a more stable and predictable income, while subscribers commit to sharing in seasonal abundance and scarcity. The result is a trust-based relationship rather than a one-off transaction.

At the heart of the Good Food Community is a commitment to ecological farming. Partner farmers grow food without toxic chemicals, focusing on soil care, crop diversity, and regenerative practices. These approaches work with natural systems rather than against them, supporting healthier soils and more resilient farms in the face of climate change. By valuing diversity in the field and in the weekly shares, the initiative also encourages eaters to reconnect with local, seasonal crops.

Food sovereignty is a central thread running through this work. The Good Food Community is not just about getting vegetables to people; it is about supporting communities’ right to define their own food systems. By decentralizing resources and prioritizing smallholder livelihoods, it helps build a food system that is less dependent on long, fragile supply chains and more rooted in local relationships.

The COVID-19 pandemic put this approach to the test. As supply chains were disrupted and hunger deepened in many communities, the Good Food Community adapted quickly. It shifted its focus to online household orders, allowing people in Metro Manila to continue accessing fresh produce even under restrictions. At the same time, it supported farmers facing market uncertainty and helped channel food to hungry communities.

Some activities had to pause. In-person events like Good Food Sundays, which had been spaces for connection and exchange, were put on hold. But the core idea of the initiative—sharing risk and reward between farmers and eaters, and using ecological practices to care for land and people—remained intact.

Today, the Good Food Community continues to show how CSA can be a tool for climate-conscious, community-centered food systems. By building long-term relationships, grounding production in regenerative practices, and decentralizing access to resources, it offers a concrete example of how food can nourish both people and the planet.
