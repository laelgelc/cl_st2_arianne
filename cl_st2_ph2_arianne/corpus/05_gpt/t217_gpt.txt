In 2021, extreme weather events crashed into people’s lives across the globe, turning what many still call a “future” climate crisis into a very present emergency. From record cold waves to raging fires and catastrophic floods, the year became a painful illustration of how climate change is intensifying and disrupting weather patterns everywhere.

Early in the year, record cold waves struck places unprepared for such extremes. Madrid was hit by a brutal cold spell, blanketing the city and pushing infrastructure and communities to their limits. In Texas, a devastating cold wave brought the power grid to its knees, leaving millions without electricity or heat for days. These events showed that climate disruption doesn’t just mean “global warming” in a simple sense, but more volatile and extreme conditions of all kinds.

At the same time, other regions were facing the opposite problem: destructive storms and floods. Cyclone Eloise slammed into Mozambique and nearby countries, tearing through homes, farms, and critical infrastructure. In Beijing, a severe sandstorm turned the sky an eerie color and forced people to confront yet another manifestation of a changing climate. In Australia and across parts of Europe, intense floods submerged towns, destroyed livelihoods, and took lives, as rivers burst their banks after extreme rainfall.

The year also brought terrifying scenes of fire. In Turkey and Greece, wildfires raged through forests and communities, forcing mass evacuations and leaving scorched landscapes behind. In California, yet another season of massive wildfires turned skies orange and filled the air with smoke, a grim repetition of a pattern that is becoming all too familiar. In Patagonia, fires tore through unique ecosystems, adding to the growing list of places pushed closer to ecological collapse.

Meanwhile, flash floods swept through parts of Asia, catching many off guard and overwhelming drainage systems and defenses. At the same time, the Amazon rainforest—one of the planet’s most vital climate regulators—continued to suffer from deforestation. Trees that store immense amounts of carbon were cut and burned, releasing more greenhouse gases and weakening one of our best natural shields against climate chaos.

All these events are connected by a common thread: climate change is making extreme weather more frequent, more intense, and more destructive. For many people, there was a time when climate warnings felt distant or abstract—something happening far away, to other communities, in other countries. Personal stories from 2021 reflect this: ignoring or downplaying the urgency, believing there was still plenty of time, or that the worst wouldn’t land on their own doorstep.

But as homes flooded, power grids failed, skies filled with smoke, and familiar landscapes were transformed overnight, those illusions shattered. When the impacts hit close—your own city under water, your relatives without power in a freeze, your favorite forest burned—it becomes impossible to pretend the crisis isn’t here and now.

The lesson from 2021 is brutally clear. The climate emergency is not a distant scenario; it is shaping our world today. To confront it, we must phase out fossil fuels as fast as possible and accelerate a just transition to renewable energy. That means replacing coal, oil, and gas with clean energy sources, transforming how we power our homes, transport, and industries, and doing it in a way that protects workers and communities.

It also means holding governments and companies accountable. Those with the most responsibility and power to act must stop delaying, weakening, or blocking the changes we need. Policies and investments must line up with what science and justice demand, not with the short-term interests of the fossil fuel industry.

The extreme weather events of 2021 are not isolated “natural disasters.” They are warnings. Paying attention to them—before they hit our own front doors—means demanding an end to fossil fuels, pushing for rapid expansion of renewable energy, and insisting that leaders and corporations take real, measurable action to confront the climate emergency.
