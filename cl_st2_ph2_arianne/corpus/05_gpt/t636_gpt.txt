Across Russia, a vast hidden forest stretches over an area twice the size of Spain. These trees grow not in officially recognized forest lands, but on agricultural plots. Under current Russian law, this makes them effectively “illegal”: landowners are required to clear these areas or face fines and other penalties.

This legal status has serious consequences. To avoid punishment, many landowners resort to unrestrained logging or even burning these forests. When that happens, enormous amounts of carbon dioxide are released into the atmosphere, undermining efforts to tackle the climate crisis. What could be a powerful climate solution instead becomes a source of emissions.

These forests are diverse. Some are old stands that have survived since Soviet times, while others are new forests that have naturally grown on abandoned or unused agricultural lands. Together, they cover around 100 million hectares. Properly protected and managed, they could form one of the world’s largest carbon sinks, help restore biodiversity, and provide space for additional tree planting.

Greenpeace Russia has been campaigning for years to change this situation. Their efforts have led to important, though still incomplete, changes in Russia’s federal Forest Code. For the first time, the law has begun to recognize forests growing on agricultural land, opening the door to regulating and protecting them instead of treating them as a problem to be removed.

However, this recognition is only partial, and much remains to be done. To push for more comprehensive reform, over 50,000 people signed a petition calling on President Vladimir Putin to go further and fully protect these forests. The details of how these legal changes will be implemented are still to be worked out, and the future of these 100 million hectares hangs in the balance.

The stakes are global. Russian forests are among the most important on Earth for both climate regulation and biodiversity. Ensuring that forests on agricultural lands are preserved and properly managed is not just a national issue—it is a crucial piece of the global response to the climate and nature crises.
