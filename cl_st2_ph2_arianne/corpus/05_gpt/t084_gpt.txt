Europe is in the middle of a volatile energy crisis. War, soaring energy prices, inflation and recession are colliding with escalating climate impacts. Together, they are pushing millions of people to the brink of energy poverty this winter.

This moment demands more than small, individual tweaks. It calls for coordinated, structural changes that cut our dependence on gas and oil, protect people from hardship, and accelerate the shift to clean, renewable energy.

One immediate step is to reduce gas, oil and electricity use in a fair and planned way. That means prioritising essential uses and critical sectors, rather than letting the market alone decide who can afford energy and who is left in the cold. Industry must be part of this effort, through rationing and mandatory measures that guarantee real reductions in fossil fuel consumption. Some countries are already showing what this can look like in practice: in the Netherlands, for example, gas use has been cut by 25%, demonstrating that significant reductions are possible when governments act.

Transport reforms are another powerful tool. Affordable public transport tickets can make it easier and cheaper for people to leave the car at home. Banning short-haul flights where rail alternatives exist, and ending the use of private jets for luxury travel, would cut wasteful oil consumption and unnecessary emissions. At the same time, encouraging and supporting more efficient driving can further reduce fuel use. Together, these measures would not only lower emissions, but also save an estimated €63 billion in oil costs.

In buildings, urgent action can both protect households and slash fossil fuel demand. Scaling up heat pumps, improving insulation and rolling out more rooftop solar can dramatically reduce the amount of gas and oil needed to heat homes and workplaces. These solutions are already available and can be deployed quickly with the right political will and financial support.

Financing this transition fairly is crucial. Taxing the windfall profits of fossil fuel companies can generate the resources needed to support vulnerable households through the crisis, helping them pay their bills and invest in energy-saving measures. At the same time, governments must stop propping up the very system that created this crisis in the first place. Ending subsidies for fossil fuels and halting any further expansion of coal, oil and gas infrastructure are essential steps.

A just transition away from fossil fuels and towards 100% renewable energy is not only a climate necessity; it is also the clearest route out of the current crisis. By cutting wasteful fossil fuel use, reshaping transport, upgrading our homes and energy systems, and making polluters pay, Europe can protect people this winter and build a safer, fairer energy future for everyone.
