When the phone finally rang, it was both a relief and a new source of fear. On the other end of the line, in Beira, Mozambique, August Maluka’s sister tried to put into words what it means to live through the aftermath of Tropical Cyclone Idai.

Her updates were fragmented by power cuts and failing connections. Each call brought a new, grim number: more people confirmed dead, more families still missing, more neighbourhoods cut off. The electricity was gone. Long lines formed wherever food and water could still be found. People waited for hours, not knowing if supplies would run out before their turn came.

She spoke of bodies washing up on the shore, of the shock of seeing lives so suddenly and violently ended. The city’s streets were caked in mud, a thick reminder of the floodwaters that had swept through homes, schools and markets. Everywhere she looked, she said, there was grief — not just in the funerals and the missing posters, but in the way people moved, slower, quieter, as if the air itself had become heavier.

Volunteering as a relief worker, she found herself at the centre of this unfolding tragedy. Access to clean water had been destroyed in many areas. Sanitation systems were badly damaged or gone altogether. She and others on the ground feared the next disaster: cholera. With contaminated water sources and poor sanitation, the conditions were ripe for an outbreak. A vaccination campaign was being prepared, a race against time to prevent more loss of life.

Yet amid the devastation, she also described something else: how people who had lost almost everything were still finding ways to help one another. Neighbours shared what little food they had. Families took in those who had nowhere left to go. Boatmen risked dangerous waters to rescue people stranded by the floods, pulling them from rooftops, trees and makeshift rafts.

From hundreds of kilometres away, listening to these stories, August Maluka saw in them the same thread he recognised across the continent: resilience. Not a passive endurance, but an active, determined support for one another in the worst of times. In Beira’s mud-filled streets and crowded relief centres, communities were holding each other up, revealing their true character in the face of catastrophe.
