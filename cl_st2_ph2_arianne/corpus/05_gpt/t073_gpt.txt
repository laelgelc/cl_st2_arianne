Across the world, rising fossil fuel prices are deepening energy poverty, forcing millions of people to choose between heating their homes and meeting other basic needs. While households struggle to afford warmth, fossil fuel companies are reporting record profits, revealing a stark injustice at the heart of today’s energy system.

The consequences are not just economic; they are profoundly human and deeply harmful to health. When people cannot afford adequate heating, hospital admissions rise. Children are especially vulnerable, with higher rates of respiratory illnesses linked to cold, damp homes and polluted indoor air. Older people face increased risks of hypothermia, as well as worsening mental health when they are left to endure long, cold months in unsafe living conditions.

Indoor air pollution is another deadly dimension of this crisis. Around 3.2 million people die every year as a result of indoor pollution, often from burning dirty fuels for cooking and heating in poorly ventilated spaces. At the same time, cold itself is a major killer, contributing to an estimated 4.5 million deaths annually. These figures expose how the current energy system fails to protect people’s most basic right to a safe, healthy life.

Access to electricity remains out of reach for nearly 1 billion people globally. Instead of improving, this situation is deteriorating in some regions, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa. In these communities, the lack of modern energy deepens poverty, limits opportunities, and locks families into reliance on dangerous, polluting fuels just to cook meals or keep warm.

Even in wealthy regions, the impacts are severe. In Europe, rising fossil fuel prices and inefficient, poorly insulated buildings are combining into a deadly threat. There is a warning of up to 335,000 excess winter deaths, as people are unable to afford the energy they need to heat their homes safely. This is not an unavoidable tragedy, but the result of policy choices and an energy system that prioritises corporate profit over human well-being.

Addressing this crisis requires redirecting the vast wealth generated by fossil fuels toward protecting people and transforming the energy system. Taxing the record profits of fossil fuel companies can provide vital funding to support those most affected by energy poverty, ensuring households can heat their homes without sacrificing other essentials.

Those funds can also drive large-scale renovation of buildings, improving insulation and efficiency so that homes require less energy to stay warm. At the same time, investing in renewable energy is crucial to ending dependence on fossil fuels altogether. Clean, affordable energy systems can protect health, reduce excess winter deaths, and ensure that no one is left in the cold while corporations profit from a broken status quo.
