Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation, or SLAPPs, are a powerful tool used to intimidate and silence people who speak out on matters of public interest. Rather than being about genuine legal grievances, SLAPPs are typically meritless or exaggerated lawsuits designed to drain time, money, and energy from critics, sending a clear message: stay quiet, or pay the price.

Corporations have increasingly turned to SLAPPs to go after activists, community groups, journalists, and organizations that challenge their practices. By framing public advocacy as defamation, fraud, or other serious legal violations, they attempt to turn legitimate criticism into a legal liability. Even when these cases are weak, the mere threat of enormous damages and long court battles can be enough to scare people into silence.

One example involves Resolute Forest Products, a logging company that launched two massive lawsuits against Greenpeace and allies. In Canada, Resolute filed a CAD$7 million lawsuit against Greenpeace Canada, targeting the organization’s advocacy around forest protection. In the United States, the company escalated further, filing a CAD$300 million lawsuit against Greenpeace entities, Stand.earth, and individual activists. In that case, Resolute used U.S. racketeering (RICO) laws—normally associated with organized crime—to claim that advocacy and campaigning amounted to fraud. These tactics sought to reframe public-interest campaigning as criminal behavior, putting enormous pressure on those speaking out.

SLAPPs don’t only target large organizations; they also hit local communities defending their health and environment. In Uniontown, Alabama, residents raised concerns about a coal ash landfill in their community. In response, they were hit with a USD$30 million lawsuit—an enormous sum for people simply trying to protect their homes and families. With support from the ACLU, the residents were able to reach a settlement that did not silence them and instead led to better protections. Their experience shows both the danger of SLAPPs and the importance of support networks in fighting back.

Despite growing awareness and the adoption of anti-SLAPP laws in some places, these abusive lawsuits are on the rise. Anti-SLAPP laws are meant to help people quickly dismiss meritless cases targeting their free speech on public issues, but they do not exist everywhere and are not always strong enough to deter determined corporate actors. As long as companies can weaponize the legal system to intimidate critics, SLAPPs will remain a threat to free expression and public participation.

In the face of this, communities, activists, and organizations can use the “Stand FIRM” approach to resist:

- Fight back: Don’t automatically give in to intimidation. Explore legal options to challenge the lawsuit and defend the right to speak out.
- Investigate: Carefully document what is happening, gather facts, and understand who is behind the lawsuit and what they are trying to achieve.
- Rally: Build alliances with other groups, legal organizations, and supporters who can provide solidarity, resources, and visibility.
- Make noise: Publicize the SLAPP, explain why it is an attack on public participation, and use media and public platforms to expose the tactic.

SLAPPs thrive in silence and fear. By recognizing them, supporting those targeted, and standing firm together, people can push back against these legal attacks and defend the space for public debate and environmental protection.
