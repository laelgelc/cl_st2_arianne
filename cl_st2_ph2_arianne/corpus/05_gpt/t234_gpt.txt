The latest data on Amazon deforestation reveal a devastating 21.97% increase – the highest rate since 2006 – with 13,235 km² of forest destroyed between August 2020 and July 2021 under President Jair Bolsonaro’s administration. This destruction is not a tragic accident; it is the predictable result of political choices that have slashed environmental protections, weakened monitoring agencies, and left Indigenous Peoples and traditional communities increasingly exposed to violence and land grabs.

These figures, released right after COP26, strip away any illusion about Brazil’s current environmental leadership. While Bolsonaro’s government tried to present itself as committed to climate action, the reality on the ground tells a very different story. The summit’s final agreement, which still allows space for ongoing forest destruction, has effectively given cover to policies that accelerate deforestation instead of stopping it. The contrast between diplomatic promises and what is happening in the Amazon could not be starker.

The consequences of this deforestation are felt far beyond the forest frontier. The Amazon is central to stabilising the climate, and its destruction is a major driver of Brazil’s high carbon emissions. As more trees are cut and burned, huge amounts of carbon are released into the atmosphere, undermining global efforts to keep temperature rise within safe limits. The clearing of forests also disrupts rainfall patterns and contributes to climate imbalance, affecting agriculture, water availability, and the resilience of ecosystems across South America and beyond.

The human cost is just as alarming. Fires used to clear land fill the air with toxic smoke, creating serious health risks for communities living in and around the Amazon. Respiratory illnesses and other health problems intensify as the burning season worsens, especially for children, older people, and those already vulnerable. At the same time, violence in the forest is escalating. Indigenous Peoples, whose territories are often the last barriers against destruction, face invasions, intimidation, and attacks. In 2020 alone, 263 Indigenous people were killed, a stark indicator of how dangerous it has become to defend land, rights, and the forest.

Bolsonaro’s policies have undermined the very institutions meant to protect the Amazon. Environmental monitoring and enforcement agencies have been weakened, making it easier for illegal loggers, land grabbers, and other destructive actors to operate with impunity. The rollback of protections has opened the door to even more aggressive exploitation, putting both biodiversity and communities at profound risk.

World leaders cannot turn a blind eye to these realities while signing trade and political deals that reward or normalise this destruction. Governments and companies must refuse to enter into agreements that enable further deforestation or violence against Indigenous communities. Instead, they should demand deforestation-free supply chains, ensuring that commodities linked to forest destruction do not reach global markets. This means setting clear, enforceable rules that cut off demand for products associated with land grabbing, illegal logging, and the expansion of destructive agribusiness into forest areas.

Supporting Indigenous Peoples and their sustainable practices is essential. Indigenous communities have long protected and managed their territories in ways that maintain forest cover and biodiversity. Backing their rights to land, self-determination, and participation in decision-making is one of the most effective ways to safeguard the Amazon. This support must go beyond rhetoric and translate into concrete political, financial, and legal measures that strengthen Indigenous autonomy and protection.

The new deforestation figures are a warning that cannot be ignored. As long as the Amazon is sacrificed for short-term profit and political gain, the climate crisis will deepen, and the rights and lives of Indigenous Peoples will continue to be threatened. It is up to world leaders, businesses, and societies everywhere to break with Bolsonaro’s destructive agenda, stand with those defending the forest, and insist on a future where the Amazon is protected, not exploited.
