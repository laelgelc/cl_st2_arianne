When our small Greenpeace Brazil team landed in Porto Velho, the capital of Rondônia, we arrived to a sky that looked deceptively normal. A few days of rain had temporarily cleared the thick smoke that usually hangs over the city at this time of year. For a moment, it was easy to forget that this same sky is often choked with the pollution of Amazon fires, and that the air people breathe here regularly becomes a health hazard.

We had come for a week-long trip to document the fires and the deforestation driving them—destruction made possible by the policies and omissions of Bolsonaro’s government. This journey marks the beginning of a series in which we will expose how deforestation, logging, and land grabbing are devastating the Amazon and the people who depend on it.

Even with the smoke briefly dispersed, the impacts of the fires were impossible to ignore. We spoke with public health experts from Fiocruz, Agevisa, and a children’s hospital in Porto Velho. They described in detail how the burning season worsens air quality and triggers a rise in respiratory problems, especially among children and elderly people. Many of these patients live far from the actual fire fronts, but the smoke does not respect distance. Carried by the wind, pollution travels across vast areas, affecting communities that may never see a single flame yet still suffer its consequences.

In the children’s hospital, doctors and staff shared their experience of caring for the youngest victims of the fires. Children arrive with aggravated asthma, bronchitis, and other respiratory illnesses that become more frequent and more severe when the burning intensifies. For families, this means repeated hospital visits, missed work, and constant anxiety about the health of their children.

Health specialists from Fiocruz and Agevisa reinforced how serious and wide-ranging the problem is. They explained that the combination of smoke, particulate pollution, and low air humidity increases the risk not only of respiratory diseases, but also of complications for people who already have chronic conditions. The elderly are particularly vulnerable, as many already suffer from heart or lung problems that the polluted air can quickly worsen.

These impacts are not a rare or unexpected event for the people of Porto Velho and surrounding regions. Residents live through this reality every year. During the dry season, the smoke returns, air humidity drops, and fires burn close enough to homes, fields, and roads to threaten both health and livelihoods. The seasonal nature of the fires does not make them any less destructive; it simply means that communities are forced to adapt to a cycle of preventable harm.

What we saw and heard in Porto Velho is part of a larger story. The fires we set out to document are not isolated incidents. They are closely linked to deforestation, to illegal and destructive logging, and to land grabbing that pushes further and further into the forest. These activities are enabled and emboldened by the Bolsonaro government, which has weakened environmental protections and enforcement, opening the door to increased destruction.

This trip is only the beginning of our reporting from the Amazon. In the coming pieces of this series, we will continue to document how deforestation advances on the forest, how land is grabbed and cleared, and how communities are forced to live with the consequences. From the hospitals where children struggle to breathe to the rural areas where smoke and flames approach people’s homes, the impacts of the fires and the policies that allow them are already painfully clear.
