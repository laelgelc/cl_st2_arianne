Uncomfortable feelings about the climate crisis are not a sign that something is wrong with us; they are a sign that we are paying attention. Psychologist Dr. Susie Burke highlights that emotions like fear, grief, and anxiety in the face of existential threats are both appropriate and important. They tell us that we care, and they can be harnessed to move us toward meaningful action.

Drawing on principles from Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, Dr. Burke encourages us to start by noticing and naming what we feel. Instead of pushing away fear, sadness, or anger, we can gently acknowledge them: “I’m feeling scared,” “I’m grieving what’s being lost,” “I’m worried about the future.” Making room for these emotions—rather than battling or suppressing them—reduces their power to overwhelm us and opens up space to choose how we want to respond.

A key strategy she describes is “completing the stress cycle.” When we’re constantly exposed to news about climate impacts, our bodies can stay stuck in a state of activation. To help our nervous systems come back to balance, Dr. Burke points to simple, accessible practices: physical activity, crying, honest conversations with people we trust, time in nature, and warm hugs. These are not trivial comforts; they are ways to let the body process and release stress so we don’t burn out or shut down.

Present-moment grounding is another tool she recommends. When climate fears pull us into catastrophic “what ifs,” we can come back to the here and now by noticing what we can see, hear, smell, taste, and touch. Tuning into our senses helps anchor us, even when our thoughts feel chaotic. This kind of mindful attention doesn’t deny the seriousness of the climate crisis, but it gives us a steadier base from which to engage with it.

Crucially, Dr. Burke emphasizes the importance of acting on our core values. Feelings of helplessness shrink when we align our actions with what matters most to us—whether that’s protecting living beings, supporting justice, or safeguarding future generations. Taking steps to reduce reliance on fossil fuels is one concrete way people can live out these values. This might involve personal choices, community initiatives, or contributing to broader efforts that challenge fossil fuel dependence. What matters is that our actions reflect the kind of world we want to help create.

Cultivating hope is not about blind optimism or pretending everything is fine. For Dr. Burke, hope grows when we raise our expectations for real solutions and for our own capacity to contribute. When we believe that change is possible—and that our efforts are part of a larger collective push—we’re more likely to stay engaged. Hope, in this sense, is a practice: noticing what’s painful, tending to our emotional responses, and then choosing to act in line with our deepest values.

By acknowledging our climate-related emotions, completing the stress cycle, grounding ourselves in the present, and taking value-driven action, we can transform distress into energy for sustained engagement. These practices don’t erase the enormity of the climate crisis, but they help us face it with more courage, connection, and a clearer sense of our personal and collective impact.
