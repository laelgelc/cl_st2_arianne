Across Europe, synthetic pesticides are driving a silent crisis. The Greenpeace report on Europe’s pesticide addiction shows how these chemicals are pushing ecosystems towards collapse, wiping out wildlife and undermining the very natural systems that keep our food production possible.

One of the starkest warnings is the scale of biodiversity loss: 24% of EU species are now threatened with extinction. Pesticides are a key driver of this decline. They don’t just target so‑called “pests”; they also harm beneficial insects, birds, soil organisms and aquatic life. As these species disappear, the ecosystem services they provide – like pollination, natural pest control and healthy soil – begin to break down.

Pollinators such as bees and other insects are essential for many crops, yet they are directly exposed to toxic chemicals in fields, hedgerows and surrounding habitats. Soil organisms, which maintain fertility and structure, are also disrupted. Over time, this undermines soil health, making farming more dependent on external chemical inputs and less resilient to climate and environmental shocks. What looks like a short‑term fix on the field becomes a long‑term trap for farmers and nature alike.

The report exposes serious gaps in how pesticides are regulated in Europe. Instead of robust, real‑world field data, authorities often rely on modeling to assess impacts. Testing is largely driven by the pesticide industry itself and focuses mainly on active ingredients, not the full formulations that end up in the environment. These practices underestimate the true risks. Even under existing regulations, the report concludes that pesticides still pose unacceptable threats to ecosystems and biodiversity.

To break this cycle, Greenpeace calls for a fundamental shift away from chemical‑dependent agriculture and towards ecological farming. This approach is based on combining scientific knowledge with respect for nature’s limits, giving local communities more control over how food is produced, and redirecting public subsidies away from industrial farming and towards practices that protect soil, water, climate and biodiversity.

Ecological farming means working with natural processes instead of constantly fighting them with synthetic chemicals. It values diversity in crops and landscapes, healthy soils, and farming systems that can sustain yields without poisoning the environment. It is not only about what happens in the field, but also about who makes decisions and who benefits from public money.

The report also urges people across Europe to take action through the #iKnowWhoGrewIt campaign. By supporting farmers who grow food without synthetic pesticides, demanding political change, and pushing for subsidy reform, citizens can help dismantle Europe’s pesticide addiction. Choosing chemical‑free food and backing ecological farming are concrete steps to protect biodiversity, safeguard pollinators and soils, and secure a more resilient, just food system for the future.
