Every minute, the equivalent of a truckload of plastic enters our oceans. A new global brand audit highlights how deeply multinational corporations are implicated in this crisis, and how urgently they must change course.

Across 42 countries, 10,000 volunteers came together to examine who is responsible for the plastic waste choking our environment. In 239 cleanups, they collected and audited 187,000 pieces of trash, carefully documenting the brands behind the pollution. The results are stark: a handful of powerful corporations are consistently among the world’s worst plastic polluters.

Coca-Cola products were found in 40 countries and ranked in the top three polluters on six continents. PepsiCo, Nestlé, Danone, Mondelez International, and Procter & Gamble also emerged as major contributors to plastic pollution. These companies rely heavily on disposable plastics, flooding markets with single-use packaging that is used for moments and then discarded, often ending up in rivers and oceans.

The brand audit underscores that this is not just a problem of individual behavior or careless littering. It is a systemic issue driven by corporate decisions to prioritize throwaway plastic packaging over reusable and refillable alternatives. While many people are already trying to reduce their plastic footprint, consumers cannot solve this crisis alone. The corporations producing and profiting from single-use plastics must take responsibility for their role in the problem and commit to real, lasting change.

The audit calls for a shift away from disposable plastics and toward systems that reduce waste at the source. It urges companies to move beyond small-scale initiatives and voluntary pledges, and to fundamentally redesign how products are packaged and delivered.

People everywhere can help push this transformation. One way is by documenting the problem as they see it in their daily lives: taking photos of branded plastic litter and sharing them online with the hashtag #IsThisYours. By publicly linking pollution to the companies behind it, this collective action increases pressure on brands to own up to their impact and change the way they do business.

The message from this global effort is clear: citizens are doing their part by exposing the scale and sources of plastic pollution. Now, multinational corporations must do theirs by ending their reliance on disposable plastics and embracing systems that protect our oceans, our communities, and our future.
