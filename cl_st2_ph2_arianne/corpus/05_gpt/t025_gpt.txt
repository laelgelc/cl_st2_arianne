I remember the first time I flew over Munduruku and Kayapó Indigenous Lands to document illegal mining. From the small plane window, the forest that should have been a continuous green sea was ripped open by gaping wounds: vast pits, torn earth, and rivers turned the color of mud. It felt like looking at a living being that had been cut open and left bleeding.

The sadness hit me so hard it was almost physical. As a Wapishana woman and a campaigner for Greenpeace Brazil, I have always known that mining is destructive. But seeing it from above, on such a scale, was something else entirely. The scars stretched far beyond what my eyes could follow, a patchwork of devastation where there should have been life, sound, and stories.

Mining in Indigenous territories is an indefensible crime. There is no justification for it. It destroys the forest, poisons the rivers, and tears apart Indigenous lives and cultures, all in the name of gold. What I saw from the air were not “development projects” or “economic opportunities,” but crimes in progress: machines chewing through sacred land, rivers suffocated by silt, and communities forced to live with contamination, violence, and fear.

As I looked down, I remembered the warnings I heard as a child. Our elders always told us that the land is sacred, that rivers are not just water but living relatives that sustain us. They warned us that once the forest is destroyed, it does not come back in the same way; that once a river is polluted, its spirit is wounded along with ours. Their words echoed in my mind as I watched the mining pits spread like an infection across the territory.

I also thought of the stories shared by Indigenous leaders about invasions and disease. Mining is never just about digging holes in the ground. It brings outsiders into territories, along with illnesses, alcohol, sexual violence, and weapons. It fragments communities, breaks social bonds, and leaves behind a trail of trauma. The gold extracted from these lands is bathed in Indigenous blood – it carries with it the pain, the loss, and the erasure of entire ways of life.

From the plane, the presence of heavy machinery was impossible to ignore. Huge excavators, including Hyundai-branded machines, were at the center of this destruction, ripping into the soil and transforming vibrant forest into a lifeless, muddy desert. These machines are not neutral tools; when they enter Indigenous territories for illegal mining, they become instruments of a crime that cannot be defended or excused.

All of this for gold – a metal that does not feed anyone, does not heal the forest, does not bring back a single fish to a dead river. Gold that ends up in banks, jewelry stores, and electronic devices, far from the places where the damage is done. The true cost of this gold is paid by Indigenous peoples, by rivers and trees, and by future generations who will inherit a world with fewer forests and poisoned waters.

We cannot accept an economic model that treats some lives and territories as expendable. The reality I witnessed makes it clear that we urgently need other ways of organizing our economies – models that preserve life instead of destroying it, that value standing forests and clean rivers more than short-term profit. Indigenous knowledge and practices already show that it is possible to live well without killing the land.

Illegal mining in Munduruku and Kayapó territories is not just an environmental problem; it is a profound injustice. It violates rights, destroys sacred places, and threatens the survival of entire peoples. It is a crime that must be stopped, and those who enable it – including the companies whose machinery is used in this destruction – must be held accountable.

When I think back to those flights, what stays with me is not only the sadness, but also a sense of urgency. Every day that mining continues, more forest is lost, more rivers are contaminated, and more Indigenous lives are put at risk. We have a responsibility to act, to stand with Indigenous peoples, and to demand an end to illegal mining.

The land is sacred. The rivers are sacred. No amount of gold can justify their destruction.
