Pride in Russia has never been just a celebration. For many, it has always been about survival, visibility, and the basic right to live without fear. Over the past two decades, LGBTQ+ people in Russia have seen their rights and safety steadily eroded. What once felt like cautious progress in the 2000s has given way to a reality where discrimination at work, the impossibility of legal marriage, and the constant risk of arrest or physical harm are part of everyday life.

Public Pride events, which in many countries are symbols of joy and protest combined, are simply not allowed. Parades are banned. The streets cannot be filled with rainbow flags, music, and crowds demanding equality. But the need for Pride has only grown stronger as rights have declined. For LGBTQ+ people and allies in Russia, Pride is still a fight for equality, dignity, and the freedom to exist openly.

Within this difficult context, staff at Greenpeace Russia decided in 2020 to create their own kind of Pride—one that could not be stopped by bans on public gatherings. They organized a digital Pride month, turning their internal channels into spaces for solidarity, learning, and support. Instead of marching in the streets, colleagues connected online through weekly challenges and shared activities that helped make LGBTQ+ lives and struggles more visible inside the organization.

The digital Pride month included articles that explored LGBTQ+ issues, as well as discussions of LGBTQ+ media, giving colleagues a chance to listen, reflect, and better understand each other’s experiences. Visual materials played a central role: rainbow frames for social media profiles and Zoom backgrounds became small but powerful tools to show support and visibility in everyday work interactions. These visual elements signaled to LGBTQ+ colleagues that they were seen and valued, and they helped normalize open allyship in a context where being visible can be dangerous.

This initiative was not just about one month of activities. It was about building trust among colleagues and putting Diversity and Inclusion principles into practice in a very concrete way. By creating space for LGBTQ+ voices and symbols within Greenpeace Russia, staff were laying the groundwork for a culture where everyone can participate fully and safely in the environmental movement.

The impact reached beyond national borders. The rainbow flag from Greenpeace Russia was featured on Greenpeace International’s social media channels, highlighting the courage and creativity of staff working under repressive conditions. That act of visibility helped connect their struggle for LGBTQ+ rights with the wider global movement for justice and equality.

For Elena Makurina, Head of Visual Solutions at Greenpeace Russia, and for many of her colleagues, Pride remains a vital and urgent act. Even when parades are banned and the risks are high, finding ways to stand together—online, at work, and in everyday life—keeps the fight for equality alive. Their digital Pride month has become both a symbol and a tool: a reminder that solidarity can flourish even in hostile environments, and an inspiration to continue advocating for a world where no one has to hide who they are.
