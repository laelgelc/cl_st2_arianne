For more than a decade, BP has been pushing ahead with plans to drill for oil in the Amazon Reef region, treating one of the planet’s most unique and little‑known ocean ecosystems as just another frontier for fossil fuel expansion. Since 2013, decisions have been taken and plans advanced without properly weighing the obvious negatives: the risk of spills, the lack of knowledge about the region, and the irreparable damage that drilling could cause to fragile marine life.

Greenpeace has been working in the area to document what is at stake. Expeditions have followed whale migration and breeding in these waters, revealing behaviour and biodiversity that had never been properly recorded before. This work includes the first underwater footage of Bryde’s Rorqual in French Guiana – a powerful reminder that these are living, breathing nurseries for marine giants, not empty spaces on an oil company’s map.

The more Greenpeace has documented, the clearer it has become that this is a hotspot of marine life. Researchers have observed sailfishes slicing through the water, pods of spotted dolphins, false killer whales and pygmy killer whales moving through the region, silky sharks patrolling the depths, and Melon head dolphins sharing these same waters. All of this evidence points to an ecosystem that is both extraordinarily diverse and highly vulnerable to disturbance.

Despite the growing body of scientific and visual evidence about the reef’s extent and its sensitivity, BP has kept pushing. In 2018, the Brazilian environmental agency IBAMA denied BP a drilling license, explicitly citing the risks of an oil spill. That decision recognised that a major spill in this region would be catastrophic, spreading across national borders and devastating wildlife that countries are only just beginning to understand.

Yet even after this clear warning, BP has not abandoned its ambitions. The company’s persistence shows how deeply the fossil fuel industry is locked into a model that treats even the most precious ocean habitats as expendable, so long as there is oil to be found. It ignores the mounting signs that the Amazon Reef region is too important, too rich in life, and too poorly understood to be turned into another drilling site.

Protecting this ecosystem requires more than case‑by‑case battles over individual drilling licenses. It demands a strong Global Ocean Treaty that can safeguard vulnerable areas from industrial exploitation, set clear rules for protection, and put marine biodiversity ahead of short‑term profit. A robust treaty would help close the loopholes that allow companies like BP to keep circling around fragile regions, waiting for a chance to drill.

BP must withdraw from the Amazon Reef region and abandon its oil drilling plans there. Governments must move quickly to secure a Global Ocean Treaty capable of defending places like this before they are damaged beyond repair. And people everywhere can add their voices to the call to protect this extraordinary, diverse ecosystem so that whales, dolphins, sharks, and countless other species can continue to thrive in these waters long into the future.
