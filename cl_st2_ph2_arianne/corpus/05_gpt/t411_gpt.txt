The sea was dark and cold when I slipped into the water from the side of the Rainbow Warrior. I could feel the weight of the bags tugging at my shoulders as I started the 500-metre swim toward the Dan Bravo oil rig. Beside me were three other activists, each of us focused on the same goal: to peacefully occupy the rig and demand an end to oil and gas exploration in the North Sea.

For a month, I had trained for this moment. I knew the swim itself would be hard, but it wasn’t just about distance. It was about learning to move through the water with heavy bags strapped to my body, about building the strength to climb a rig ladder after the cold had seeped into my muscles, and about preparing to camp out on a helipad in relentless wind. Every training session was a reminder that fossil fuels are pushing our climate to the limit, and that taking action would require pushing my own limits too.

Reaching the rig, we began the careful, exhausting climb up the ladder. The metal was slick, the wind constant, and my arms felt every extra kilo from the gear we had carried with us. When we finally pulled ourselves onto the helipad, the North Sea wind hit us full force. This was where we would stay for the next 36 hours.

We set up our small camp, securing everything we could against the gusts. Up there, surrounded by open sea and sky, the scale of the fossil fuel industry felt both immense and fragile. The Dan Bravo rig is part of a system that has been drilling and burning for decades, yet it only takes a handful of people and a clear message to disrupt “business as usual,” even if only for a moment.

We unfurled our banner so it could be seen from the air and the sea below, a clear call against continued oil and gas exploration. Between the roar of the wind and the hum of machinery, we recorded messages of thanks to everyone who had supported us and this action. Knowing that people on land were standing with us helped keep the cold and fatigue at bay.

During our occupation, Total shut down production on the rig. That decision underscored why we were there: fossil fuel extraction is not inevitable. It is a choice, and choices can change.

As the hours passed, the weather forecast worsened. In the North Sea, bad weather is not something you ignore. For our safety, we made the decision to leave earlier than planned. We packed up quickly, climbed back down, and slipped once again into the dark water, swimming back toward the Rainbow Warrior as the wind picked up and the waves grew steeper.

Those 36 hours on the Dan Bravo rig were physically demanding, but they were also a powerful statement. We were there to say that the era of new oil and gas must end, and that the North Sea can and must become a symbol of a different future.

I am asking you to stand with us in demanding a fossil-free #NorthSeaRevolution. Every action, every voice, and every show of support helps push us closer to a world where we leave oil and gas behind and choose a safer, fairer future instead.
