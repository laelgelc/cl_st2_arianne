When I joined Greenpeace Africa in 2011, I was coming from a newsroom in Cameroon, trading the daily rush of breaking stories for the deeper, slower work of shifting narratives and holding power to account. I started as a Communications Manager and eventually became Head of Communications, but throughout that journey one thing stayed constant: the belief that stories, told clearly and courageously, can change the course of events.

One of the earliest and most defining chapters of my time at Greenpeace Africa was our opposition to nuclear expansion in South Africa. Alongside colleagues, allies and communities, we challenged plans to lock the country into a risky and costly energy path at a time when clean, renewable alternatives were not only possible but urgently needed. Communicating around this campaign meant making complex issues accessible and amplifying the voices of those who would be most affected. In 2019, when the expansion was finally abandoned, it felt like proof that determined resistance, backed by strong public engagement, can reshape national decisions.

From the energy frontlines in South Africa, our work extended to the waters of West Africa. Aboard the Rainbow Warrior, we exposed illegal fishing activities that were threatening the livelihoods and food security of coastal communities. This was more than a story about boats and quotas; it was about justice on the high seas and the right of people to benefit from the resources off their own shores. The evidence we helped bring to light contributed to the revocation of licenses for vessels involved in illegal practices, a concrete outcome that showed how investigations, communications and activism can combine to deliver real change.

In Senegal, we launched a report that laid bare the devastating impacts of overfishing on local communities. The story resonated well beyond environmental circles because it was also a story about migration, poverty and dignity. As fish stocks dwindled, many people felt they had no choice but to risk dangerous journeys in search of a future elsewhere. By connecting overfishing to these broader social and economic realities, the report helped influence policy discussions and shifted how migration narratives were framed in the country and beyond. It underlined that protecting the ocean is inseparable from protecting people’s rights and opportunities at home.

Our campaigns also took us deep into the heart of Africa’s energy debates. We stood against coal dependence, exposing how it locks countries into pollution, inequality and climate vulnerability. At the same time, we pushed for renewable energy and a Just Transition—one that doesn’t leave workers or communities behind as economies move away from fossil fuels. Communicating these ideas meant challenging powerful interests while offering a hopeful, practical vision of what a fair, sustainable future could look like.

All of this unfolded against a backdrop of entrenched corruption and ongoing deforestation in the Congo Basin, one of the planet’s most vital forest regions. Time and again, we encountered how corruption undermines environmental protection and how short-term profit drives the destruction of forests that millions of people, and the global climate, depend on. Speaking out about this required persistence and courage, especially as civic space shrank in many places and the risks for activists and journalists grew.

Then came COVID-19, a pandemic that disrupted lives and movements across the continent and the world. It forced us to rethink how we organise, how we tell stories and how we stand in solidarity when physical gatherings are limited. Yet even amid lockdowns and uncertainty, the work of resisting environmental injustice and narrative manipulation did not stop. If anything, the crisis exposed how deeply environmental, social and economic injustices are intertwined—and how vital it is to keep challenging the systems that produce them.

Looking back, what stays with me most is not only the campaigns won or the policies influenced, but the ongoing struggle to change narratives: to show that environmental protection is not a luxury, but a necessity for justice, dignity and survival; that communities on the frontlines of extraction, pollution and climate impacts are also on the frontlines of solutions; and that another way of living with our oceans, forests and energy systems is both necessary and possible.

From the corridors of power in South Africa to the docks of West African fishing towns and the forests of the Congo Basin, this journey has been about insisting that the voices of those most affected by environmental harm are heard, respected and acted upon. Even in the face of pandemics, corruption and powerful interests, that insistence continues—and so does the work of building a future grounded in environmental justice.
