Merlin Sheldrake’s *Entangled Life* offers a vivid tour through the hidden world of fungi, revealing how much of life on Earth depends on organisms we rarely see and often ignore. The book centers on mycorrhizal networks—vast underground webs formed by fungi and plant roots—that have been nicknamed the “Wood Wide Web.” Through these networks, fungi and plants exchange nutrients, information, and even forms of protection, reshaping how we understand ecosystems and our place within them.

Sheldrake shows how fungi form intimate symbiotic relationships with plants, making life possible in ways that are easy to overlook. Certain plants, such as Ghost pipe and some orchids, rely on fungi to obtain nutrients they cannot access themselves. Instead of photosynthesizing in the usual way, they tap into fungal networks that connect them to other plants, effectively plugging into a shared nutrient economy. This underground cooperation challenges the idea of plants as isolated individuals and reveals a far more interconnected reality.

The book also explores how mycorrhizal networks allow plants to communicate. Through fungal threads, trees and other plants can transmit signals that trigger defense responses against pests. When one plant is attacked, it can send chemical warnings through the fungal network, prompting neighbors to bolster their own defenses. This system of support and signaling suggests that forests and other plant communities act less like collections of separate organisms and more like interdependent, responsive communities.

Beyond their ecological importance, fungi have striking medicinal potential. Sheldrake highlights research into fungi that can help bees fight off viruses, offering hope for pollinators under pressure from multiple threats. He also points to fungi with antiviral properties that may benefit humans, underlining how these organisms could play a role in improving health and resilience across species. In this view, fungi are not just decomposers but also allies, with capacities that science is only beginning to understand.

Throughout the book, Sheldrake challenges conventional notions of individuality. Fungi blur the boundaries between one organism and another, weaving together plants, animals, and microbes into dense, interdependent biomes. Instead of discrete beings competing in isolation, life appears as a series of entanglements in which survival is collective. Our bodies, soils, and ecosystems become legible as networks of relationships rather than separate units.

This perspective leads to a critique of industrial agriculture and its impact on soil. By relying on intensive tilling, synthetic fertilizers, and pesticides, industrial systems disrupt and destroy the fungal networks that sustain soil health. The result is degraded land that becomes increasingly dependent on external inputs. In contrast, Sheldrake points to fungi’s potential in ecological restoration: by rebuilding mycorrhizal networks and harnessing fungi’s abilities to recycle nutrients and stabilize ecosystems, it is possible to support the recovery of damaged environments. Drawing on historical and scientific examples, the book presents fungi as crucial partners in repairing the very systems that industrial practices have undermined.

*Entangled Life* ultimately invites readers to see fungi as central players in the story of life on Earth. From nourishing forests and enabling plant communication to offering medicinal possibilities and helping restore damaged landscapes, fungi emerge as powerful agents of connection. By revealing the depth of our entanglement with these organisms, Sheldrake encourages a shift in how we think about nature, moving from separation and control toward relationship and mutual dependence.
