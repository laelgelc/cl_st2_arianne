In 2020, “lockdown” became the word that defined a year of distance, isolation and anxiety. Around the world, people stayed home, streets fell quiet, and daily routines were upended by the COVID‑19 pandemic. Yet while human activity slowed in many places, the planetary emergencies we face did not pause. Environmental crises deepened, collided and became impossible to ignore.

Out at sea, Greenpeace’s “Protect The Oceans” voyage continued its work, even in this difficult year. The crew inspected ships and documented the impacts of climate change in the Antarctic, where warming temperatures and a changing ocean are reshaping one of the most remote regions on Earth. Their mission highlighted how fragile marine ecosystems are, and how urgently they need protection from overexploitation and climate disruption.

On land, communities on the frontlines of the climate crisis pushed ahead with solutions. In Kenya, farmers turned to ecological farming practices to cope with a changing climate. By working with nature instead of against it, they are building resilience into their fields and livelihoods, showing a pathway toward food systems that can better withstand shocks.

Elsewhere, climate impacts were devastating and immediate. Massive wildfires tore through California and Australia, burning forests and communities, killing wildlife and people, and leaving behind charred landscapes. The images of orange skies and scorched habitats became symbols of a world increasingly shaped by extreme heat and drought.

In the Philippines, powerful typhoons brought catastrophic flooding. Communities already familiar with storms faced yet another round of destruction, and voices from the country grew louder in calling for climate justice. Their demands underscored that those who have contributed least to the climate crisis are often the ones who suffer its worst impacts.

Far to the north, a disaster on the Kamchatka Peninsula killed large numbers of marine animals and polluted the coastline. The scale of the damage forced government authorities to respond, drawing attention to the vulnerability of marine life and coastal communities to pollution and mismanagement.

Across South America, deforestation continued to threaten the Amazon rainforest and the Gran Chaco. These ecosystems are home to immense biodiversity and play a crucial role in regulating the climate, yet they are being cleared and degraded, pushing species toward collapse and weakening natural defenses against global warming.

In the oceans, the Great Barrier Reef suffered further coral bleaching. As waters warm, corals expel the algae they depend on, leaving ghostly white skeletons where vibrant reefs once thrived. This bleaching is a stark reminder that climate change is transforming even the world’s most iconic natural wonders.

And all over the globe, floods displaced and affected millions of people. From swollen rivers to inundated cities, rising waters exposed the fragility of infrastructure and the growing risks that extreme weather poses to homes, health and livelihoods.

Through all of this, activists and communities continued to document what was happening. From ship decks in the Antarctic to farms in Kenya, from fire‑scarred forests to storm‑battered coastlines, people gathered evidence, told stories and refused to look away. Their work made it clear that the crises unfolding in 2020 were not isolated events, but connected symptoms of a planet in trouble.

In a year defined by lockdowns and separation, these acts of witness and resistance brought the world closer together. By shining a light on environmental destruction and frontline resilience, activists helped ensure that even in the midst of a global pandemic, the fight for climate and environmental justice did not go into lockdown.
