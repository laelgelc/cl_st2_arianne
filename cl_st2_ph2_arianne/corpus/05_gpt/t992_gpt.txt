Economic growth is often celebrated as the ultimate measure of progress, yet it routinely ignores the very real costs that make this growth possible. Forests are cleared, oceans are emptied, soils are exhausted, and species are driven to extinction, but these losses rarely appear on balance sheets. Instead, they are treated as “externalities” – invisible in economic statistics, but devastating in the real world.

Even attempts to make growth “greener” run into a fundamental problem: the rebound effect. When we improve efficiency – using less energy or fewer materials per unit of production – the immediate gains are often wiped out because total consumption rises. Cheaper, more efficient products and services tend to be used more, not less, so overall environmental pressure continues to grow.

Nature offers a stark warning about this logic of endless expansion. In ecosystems and in biology more broadly, unchecked growth is not a sign of health; it is a sign of imbalance. When populations or resource use exceed the carrying capacity of their environment, they enter overshoot. For a time, things can look stable or even prosperous, but the underlying foundations are eroding. Eventually, this overshoot leads to collapse. History is full of examples where societies undermined their own ecological base and paid the price.

The degrowth movement responds to these realities by calling for a deliberate reduction in material throughput – the total flow of energy and resources through our economies. The aim is not hardship, but sustainability and fairness: using less so that all can live well within the limits of the planet. Degrowth challenges the assumption that well-being must be tied to ever-rising consumption, especially in already wealthy societies.

Crucially, degrowth does not reject all forms of growth. It draws a clear line between material expansion and non-material flourishing. While more extraction, production, and waste push us deeper into ecological crisis, there is no such limit on the growth of ideas, knowledge, relationships, or cultural diversity. A society can be rich in creativity, solidarity, and meaning without being rich in material throughput.

This perspective emphasizes conservation, simplification, and sharing. Conservation means protecting ecosystems and resources instead of treating them as expendable. Simplification means designing ways of living that require fewer materials and less energy, rather than constantly adding new layers of complexity and consumption. Sharing means organizing access to goods and services so that they are used more efficiently and more fairly, instead of duplicated and hoarded.

The current model of economic growth also relies heavily on shifting its worst impacts onto others. Wealthy nations often outsource resource extraction, pollution, and waste to poorer countries, while importing the benefits in the form of cheap goods and raw materials. The environmental and social damages – from destroyed landscapes to exploited workers – are kept out of sight, allowing the illusion of “clean” growth in richer economies to persist.

Degrowth challenges this injustice. It calls on affluent societies to reduce their material demands so that people elsewhere are not forced to bear the hidden costs of their consumption. This is not about making life poorer, but about redefining what a rich life actually means.

Instead of chasing satisfaction through ever more stuff, degrowth points toward richer lives grounded in community, time, and creativity. It values strong social ties over status competition, shared spaces over private excess, and meaningful activities over endless accumulation. In this vision, progress is measured not by the size of economies, but by the health of ecosystems, the strength of communities, and the freedom for people to live well without destroying their shared home.
