Around the world, people who stand up for land, water, forests, and the climate are being threatened, criminalized, and killed. Governments and corporations are increasingly treating environmental and human rights movements as enemies, branding them as “terrorists,” targeting them with surveillance, and trying to silence them through lawsuits and intimidation.

This is not an abstract trend. According to Global Witness, killings of environmental defenders have risen sharply in recent years: from 154 in 2015, to 201 in 2016, and 207 in 2017. In 2018, 66 more defenders were killed. Behind every number is a person, a community, and an ecosystem they were trying to protect.

One of the most emblematic cases is that of Berta Cáceres, a Lenca Indigenous leader from Honduras. Berta was murdered in 2016 for her role in opposing the Agua Zarca dam project on the Gualcarque River. The dam threatened local ecosystems and violated the rights of the Lenca people, who depend on the river and consider it sacred.

Berta’s struggle put her in direct conflict with powerful economic and political interests. After her killing, an investigation linked officials from the company Desarrollos Energéticos S.A. (DESA), which was behind the Agua Zarca project, to the planning of her assassination. Her case has become a symbol of the risks faced by those who defend their territories and the environment against destructive projects.

This week, the trial of eight people accused in connection with Berta Cáceres’ murder begins. It is a critical moment, not only for her family and community, but for environmental defenders everywhere. The proceedings offer a chance to challenge the pattern of impunity that so often follows these crimes and to insist that those who order, plan, and carry out attacks against defenders are held to account.

As killings and attacks continue, the need to protect environmental and Indigenous defenders is inseparable from the broader fight to protect the planet. Defending forests, rivers, and territories from destructive projects goes hand in hand with defending the people who risk their lives to do so. Justice for Berta Cáceres, and for all those who have been threatened or killed for defending their homes and the environment, is part of the struggle for a livable future for everyone.
