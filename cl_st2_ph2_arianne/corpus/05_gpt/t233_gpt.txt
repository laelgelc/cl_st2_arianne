Fikile Ntshangase was shot dead in her home in South Africa for resisting coal mining. Berta Cáceres was murdered in Honduras after leading a campaign against a hydroelectric dam. Marielle Franco was assassinated in Brazil after defending human rights and denouncing police brutality in Rio’s favelas. Nora Apique was killed in the Philippines for standing up against destructive projects on her ancestral lands.  

These women are not only names in the past; they are symbols of a global pattern of violence against those who dare to protect land, water, and communities. Their struggles were rooted in justice: defending territories from extractive industries, defending people from militarisation and corporate power, and defending the right to participate in decisions that shape their lives and environments. Their murders are part of an escalating crisis where environmental destruction and gender-based violence reinforce each other.

Across the world, women, girls, and gender minorities are at the frontlines of environmental resistance. They organise communities, expose abuses, and confront powerful interests. At the same time, they are targeted because of who they are and what they represent in societies shaped by sexism and patriarchal systems. They face threats not only for opposing mines, dams, or logging, but also for challenging deeply rooted gender norms and power structures.  

Global Witness has documented how dangerous this work has become. In 2020 alone, 227 land and environmental defenders were assassinated. One-third of those killed were Indigenous people, despite Indigenous communities making up a much smaller share of the world’s population. Their deep ties to territory and their leadership in protecting biodiversity put them in direct conflict with governments, corporations, and criminal groups seeking profit from land and resource exploitation.  

Impunity is almost total: in 95% of these cases, no one is held accountable. This sends a clear message to perpetrators that they can silence defenders without consequence. While 90% of those killed are men, violence against women defenders is rising and often takes different, gendered forms. Women defenders report rape, sexual assault, and harassment, as well as blackmail and extortion that target their families and reputations. The intention is not just to stop their activism, but to shame, isolate, and punish them for stepping outside prescribed gender roles.  

This violence is unfolding in the context of accelerating climate impacts. Today, 85% of humanity is already affected by the climate crisis. Climate disasters, resource scarcity, and displacement intensify existing inequalities and make women, girls, and gender minorities even more vulnerable to abuse. When communities are pushed to the brink, those who raise their voices against pollution, land grabs, and unjust policies often become targets.  

The struggles of Fikile, Berta, Marielle, and Nora show how environmental defense is inseparable from the fight against sexism, racism, and colonial legacies. Extractive projects and climate destruction are not gender-neutral. They are embedded in systems that value profit over life and concentrate power in the hands of a few—often in the Global North—while the costs are borne by communities in the Global South, by Indigenous peoples, and by those already facing discrimination.  

An ecofeminist revolution calls for confronting these intertwined systems of oppression. It insists that protecting the Earth means dismantling patriarchal structures that normalise violence against women and gender minorities. It demands that environmental policies and climate solutions centre the voices and leadership of those most affected, rather than silencing or sacrificing them.  

This also means confronting the responsibility of the Global North in driving ecological breakdown and enabling violence. Wealthy countries, corporations, and financial institutions benefit from extractive projects that fuel both environmental destruction and attacks on defenders. Accountability requires more than statements of concern: it requires changing trade rules, investment flows, and political alliances that currently reward those who grab land, pollute ecosystems, and repress opposition.  

Protecting environmental defenders—especially women, girls, and gender minorities—is not a side issue; it is central to any just response to the climate and biodiversity crises. Legal protection, rapid response mechanisms, and community-based security are crucial, but they must go hand in hand with transforming the conditions that make this violence possible in the first place.  

The memories of Fikile Ntshangase, Berta Cáceres, Marielle Franco, and Nora Apique call on the world to act. Honouring their legacies means refusing to accept a future where defending rivers, forests, and neighbourhoods is a death sentence. It means standing with those who continue their work, demanding justice in the face of impunity, and building an ecofeminist movement strong enough to confront both environmental destruction and gender-based violence, together.
