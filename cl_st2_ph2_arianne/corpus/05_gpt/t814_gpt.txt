Across Europe, a bright symbol has been rising over city skylines and public squares: a giant sun calling for a clean energy future.

Greenpeace first used this powerful image in Paris two years ago, during the UN Climate Conference, to demand a decisive shift away from fossil fuels and towards renewable energy. Since then, the sun has continued its journey, appearing in Barcelona, in Croatia, and in several other European countries, including Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Slovenia, and Brussels.

These suns are more than artwork. They are a clear message to decision-makers that people across Europe want an energy system powered by renewables, not by dirty fuels that damage our climate and our health.

Last week, that message was brought directly to the heart of EU decision-making. Sixty-five activists from five different countries gathered outside the European Commission and unfurled a huge “Go solar!” banner. Their demand was straightforward: EU leaders must support renewable energy and move away from fossil fuels as they review and rewrite key pieces of energy legislation.

This is a crucial moment. The rules being decided now will shape Europe’s energy system for years to come. Ordinary people and businesses are already ready to be part of the solution—they are prepared to join the energy revolution by embracing clean, renewable power.

To make sure their voices are heard, we’re asking you to take two simple actions: sign the petition calling on EU leaders to back renewables and reject dirty fuels, and share the video of these actions so that more people across Europe can add their support.

Together, we can help turn these suns from symbols into reality—and push Europe towards the clean energy future it urgently needs.
