Deep sea mining is being aggressively promoted as the next frontier of resource extraction, but the industry is built on ignoring clear scientific warnings. Existing evidence shows that mining in the deep ocean causes severe and long-lasting damage to fragile ecosystems that have taken millennia to form. Rather than treating these risks with the seriousness they deserve, deep sea mining companies and their supporters are pushing ahead as if the ocean were an expendable resource.

The precautionary principle is clear: when activities pose a risk of serious or irreversible harm to the environment, the lack of full scientific certainty should not be used as a reason to proceed. In the case of deep sea mining, we already know enough to understand the scale of the threat. The damage to deep sea habitats, the disruption of species we barely understand, and the potential for wide-ranging impacts on ocean health all demand that mining be halted before it starts.

Yet the International Seabed Authority (ISA), the body tasked with both regulating deep sea mining and protecting the marine environment, has repeatedly shown that it prioritizes economic interests over environmental protection. Instead of acting as a strong guardian of the deep ocean, it has moved in step with industry timelines and pressures, treating the seabed as a resource bank rather than a shared global commons that must be safeguarded.

Companies like DeepGreen and GSR have tried to frame deep sea mining as a climate solution, claiming that extracting metals from the seabed is necessary for technologies like electric vehicles and renewable energy. This narrative is a form of greenwashing. Through slick messaging and what has been called “minesplaining,” they present mining as an inevitable and even environmentally friendly choice, downplaying the very real and potentially irreversible harm to the deep ocean. Their claims of climate benefits ignore the reality that destroying critical ecosystems cannot be reconciled with genuine environmental protection.

A central tactic of this greenwashing is to present a false choice: either accept deep sea mining or continue destructive mining on land. This framing hides a third path that is both necessary and achievable—using the resources we already have more efficiently and transforming our economies to rely less on raw extraction. Rather than expanding mining into one of the planet’s last relatively untouched frontiers, we should focus on resource efficiency, reducing demand for new materials, and building a truly circular economy in which metals are reused, repaired, and recycled wherever possible.

By improving product design, extending the lifespan of devices, increasing recycling rates, and shifting away from wasteful consumption, societies can meet many of their material needs without opening up the deep sea to industrial exploitation. The rush to mine the ocean floor is not a technological inevitability; it is a political and economic choice that benefits a small number of companies at the expense of global ocean health.

Protecting the deep ocean requires strong, binding rules that put ecosystems and communities before corporate profit. A robust Global Ocean Treaty is essential to safeguard international waters from destructive industries like deep sea mining. Such a treaty can help create large-scale marine protected areas, set clear limits on exploitation, and ensure that decisions about the ocean are guided by science and the public interest, not by the short-term goals of mining companies.

Deep sea mining is a threat, not a solution. With clear evidence of its potential for long-lasting harm, and with viable alternatives rooted in resource efficiency and a circular economy, the only responsible path is to keep the deep ocean off-limits to mining. Supporting a strong Global Ocean Treaty is a critical step toward ensuring that the oceans are protected from this new wave of industrial exploitation.
