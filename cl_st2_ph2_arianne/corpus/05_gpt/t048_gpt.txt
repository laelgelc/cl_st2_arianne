A new Greenpeace report, “Food Injustice 2020–22”, exposes how some of the world’s biggest agribusiness corporations turned overlapping global crises into an opportunity for profit, while hundreds of millions of people faced rising hunger.

The report shows that just 20 major corporations in the grain, fertiliser, meat and dairy sectors paid out $53.5 billion to their shareholders in 2020–2021. This windfall came in the context of the COVID‑19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine, both of which disrupted global food and energy systems and drove up prices.

The $53.5 billion these corporations channelled to shareholders is more than the $51.5 billion the UN estimated would be needed to support 230 million of the world’s most vulnerable people. In other words, at the very moment when global resources were desperately needed to prevent hunger and hardship, a relatively small group of companies was able to direct even more money to already-wealthy investors.

According to the report, this was not an accident of the market but a consequence of market concentration. A handful of powerful firms dominate key parts of the global food system, from grain trading to fertiliser production to meat and dairy processing. This concentration allows them to control supply chains and withhold crucial information about stocks, costs and contracts. In times of crisis and uncertainty, this lack of transparency makes it easier to push prices higher than necessary, inflating both prices and profits.

The impacts are felt most acutely by those with the least power: low‑income households, communities already on the frontlines of the climate crisis, and small‑scale farmers who struggle to compete in a system tilted towards corporate giants.

The report argues that addressing hunger and social injustice in a time of climate breakdown requires a fundamental shift away from this corporate‑dominated model. It calls for food sovereignty: putting control over food systems back in the hands of people and communities, especially small‑scale farmers who prioritise local needs, ecological balance and resilience over short‑term profit.

Alongside food sovereignty, the report highlights broader measures to tackle inequality and ensure everyone’s right to food is met. These include universal basic income to guarantee a minimum level of economic security, windfall taxes on crisis‑driven corporate profits, and stronger taxation of dividends to curb excessive payouts to shareholders.

In a world facing intensifying climate impacts, these steps are presented as essential not only to end hunger, but also to build fairer, more resilient societies where the basic needs of all are put ahead of the profits of a few.
