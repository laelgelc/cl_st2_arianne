The world is facing overlapping crises. The COVID-19 health emergency and its economic fallout are unfolding on top of a chronic climate crisis that has been building for decades. In the middle of this turmoil, decisions are being made—about where public money goes, which industries are rescued, and what kind of future we are choosing.

Those decisions cannot be left to destructive industries that helped create today’s vulnerabilities. As governments mobilise unprecedented public funds, we must prevent these resources from being poured into polluting, exploitative business models that deepen inequality and environmental breakdown. Instead, this money should be directed toward strengthening public health, safeguarding the planet’s life-support systems, and advancing a just transition that leads us toward a more harmonious and equitable future.

Moments of shock are dangerous as well as decisive. In times of fear and uncertainty, powerful interests often seize opportunities to push through harmful policies that would normally face public resistance. This “shock doctrine” approach treats crises as a cover for deregulation, privatisation, and bailouts that entrench the status quo. We need vigilance to ensure that emergency measures are not used to lock us into more extraction, more pollution, and more social injustice.

Holding leaders accountable is essential. Elected officials and institutions must be answerable for how they use public resources and whose interests they serve. People have the right—and the responsibility—to question decisions, demand transparency, and insist that recovery plans are compatible with environmental protection, social justice, and long-term resilience. Public funds must serve the public good, not the short-term profits of industries that damage health and the environment.

At the same time, this is an opportunity to advocate for a different path. We can push for investment in cooperative, community-centred solutions that align human activity with the needs of nature. This includes supporting systems and infrastructures that respect ecological limits, protect the most vulnerable, and create decent, sustainable livelihoods. By championing nature-aligned investments, we can help steer recovery efforts toward a future where economic security, public health, and a stable climate reinforce one another instead of being traded off.

The way we treat each other during crisis matters as much as the policies we win. Combating the virus—and responding to its economic and social impacts—requires compassion, courage, and solidarity. Blame and division only weaken our collective ability to care for one another and to protect those at greatest risk. Responding with empathy helps ensure that no one is left behind, whether they are frontline workers, people in precarious jobs, or communities already bearing the brunt of environmental harm.

There are lessons to be learned that go beyond any single crisis. We are being reminded how interconnected we are, how much we depend on care work and public services, and how quickly the most vulnerable can be pushed to the edge. Learning from this means redesigning our systems so that protection, not exploitation, becomes the norm. It means building alliances across movements and communities to defend shared values and common goods.

In doing this work, it is important not to lose sight of what sustains us. Prioritising family, community, and self-care is not a distraction from activism; it is what makes sustained engagement possible. Looking after our own well-being and that of those closest to us strengthens the foundations from which we can act for wider change.

Crises have a way of making the previously “impossible” suddenly possible. Governments can mobilise vast resources; societies can reorganise priorities overnight. This power can be used to entrench destructive patterns—or to break with them. The choices made now will shape the kind of world that emerges: one that doubles down on extraction and inequality, or one that moves toward justice, cooperation, and a healthier relationship with the Earth.

We have a narrow window to insist that public money and political will are used to protect people and the planet, not to rescue destructive industries. By staying vigilant, holding leaders to account, standing together in compassion, and pushing for investments that align with nature and justice, we can help ensure that what becomes possible in this crisis is transformation for the better, not a deepening of the problems we already face.
