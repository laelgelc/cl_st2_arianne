On the road through Porto Velho, Lábrea, and Humaitá, the landscape tells a story that is impossible to ignore. What at first glance might look like “development” quickly reveals itself as a wave of agribusiness expansion sweeping across the Amazon, leaving deep social and environmental scars in its path.

In community after community, agroextractivists – people whose livelihoods depend on the sustainable use of forest resources – are being pushed off their lands. The traditional balance between people and forest is being broken as land accumulation intensifies and powerful interests take over ever larger areas. The forest that once supported families and cultures is being carved up, fenced off, and transformed.

This process does not stop at traditional communities. Indigenous territories are facing invasions that threaten both the people who live there and the ecosystems they protect. After the most valuable timber is removed, cattle ranching moves in. Once the land is degraded and cleared, preparations begin for soy plantations. Each stage pushes the forest further from recovery and locks in a model of land use that prioritizes profit over life.

Alongside these changes on the ground, new infrastructure is rapidly reshaping the region. Freshly opened bus lines, highways, and branches are designed to move goods and people faster and deeper into the forest. These projects are expected to accelerate deforestation and increase the flow of people into frontier areas, repeating the same destructive pattern already seen in the Cerrado and in parts of Pará: roads first, deforestation and land conflicts soon after.

Traveling through burned areas and hearing testimonies of violence and dispossession is profoundly painful. The blackened trunks, the smoke on the horizon, and the stories of families forced to leave their homes make clear that what is at stake is not an abstract debate, but lives, cultures, and one of the planet’s most vital ecosystems.

Yet even in the midst of this destruction, there are people and projects pointing toward a different future. Encounters with those who are building models of sustainable development show that another path is possible – one that keeps the forest standing and supports the communities who have protected it for generations. Their work is a reminder that resistance is alive and that the Amazon is not only a place of loss, but also of courage and hope.

Standing with these guardians of the forest means refusing to accept a future defined by burned clearings and endless monocultures. It means amplifying the voices of agroextractivists and Indigenous peoples, defending their territories, and challenging the expansion of destructive agribusiness and infrastructure that fuels deforestation.

The Amazon is at a crossroads. The choices made now will echo far beyond Porto Velho, Lábrea, and Humaitá. Join the movement to stand with those who protect the forest and to support the paths of sustainable development that keep the Amazon – and all of us who depend on it – alive.
