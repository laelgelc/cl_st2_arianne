When Kylian was seven years old, he made a decision that felt as big as the ocean he loves: he cut his long hair.

Growing up in Mauritius in a family of fishers and ocean lovers, the sea has always been part of Kylian’s life. His family’s connection to fishing and conservation meant he learned early on that the ocean is more than just a beautiful view – it is home to countless animals and the source of livelihoods for many people around him.

A visit to the Ile Aux Aigrettes nature reserve helped him understand this even more deeply. On the small island, he learned how wildlife, the ocean, and local communities are all linked. The birds, plants and marine life depend on each other, and people depend on a healthy ocean for food, work and protection. That experience stayed with him.

Then the Wakashio ship ran aground off the coast of Mauritius, spilling 1,000 tonnes of oil into the sea. The thick, dark slick spread across the water, damaging marine life and threatening the fragile ecosystems Kylian had come to care about. The place he loved was in danger.

Kylian wanted to help. He had worn his hair long and cherished it, but when he heard that hair could be used in barriers to absorb oil from the water, he decided to donate it. Sitting in the chair as his hair was cut, he knew it was going to be used to help protect the ocean and the animals he cared about.

His action didn’t stop there. Kylian recorded a motivational YouTube video to encourage others to take part and to show that even children can do something meaningful. He joined a protest, standing alongside others who were demanding protection for the ocean and those whose lives depend on it. And he wrote a story, using his words and imagination to inspire more people – especially other children – to care for the sea.

For Kylian, protecting the ocean is not an abstract idea. It is about his home, his family’s way of life, and the wildlife he met on Ile Aux Aigrettes. His story shows how a child’s courage and compassion can ripple outward, turning a single act – cutting his treasured hair – into a powerful message of hope and responsibility.

Kylian’s voice is one of many in the Vital Ocean Voices series, but his message is clear: no one is too young to stand up for the ocean, and every action, no matter how small it seems, can help protect the blue planet we all share.
