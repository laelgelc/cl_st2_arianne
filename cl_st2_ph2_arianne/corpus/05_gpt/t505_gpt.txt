In 2019, forests across the globe burned on a terrifying scale. From the vast taiga of Russia to the Amazon in Brazil, and from Indonesia’s peatlands to Australia’s bush, wildfires devastated ecosystems, took human and animal lives, and released enormous amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.

The climate impact of these fires was staggering. Russia’s fires alone released an estimated 500 million tonnes of CO2. In Brazil, fires emitted around 366 million tonnes, while in Indonesia they released about 708 million tonnes. Each of these figures is comparable to the annual fossil fuel emissions of major countries. In a single fire season, these forests—normally powerful carbon sinks—were transformed into massive sources of greenhouse gases.

Yet, despite these vast emissions, a Greenpeace report shows that Russia, Brazil, and Indonesia systematically underreport fire-related emissions. There is no proper accounting of the climate damage caused, and no meaningful system of compensation for the communities and ecosystems affected. This gap in reporting and accountability hides the real scale of the crisis from public view and from international climate negotiations.

The consequences of these fires go beyond CO2. They also produce black carbon—soot particles that darken snow and ice, especially in the Arctic. When black carbon settles on ice, it reduces reflectivity and accelerates melting. This speeds up Arctic ice loss, amplifying global warming and disrupting climate systems worldwide.

At the same time, the fires destroy the very forests that help protect the climate. By burning trees and degrading ecosystems, wildfires reduce the capacity of forests to capture and store carbon in the future. The damage is therefore both immediate, through emissions, and long-term, through the loss of one of our most important natural climate defenses.

The impacts are deeply human as well. Fires threaten health through toxic smoke, displace communities, and hit Indigenous Peoples especially hard. Many Indigenous communities live in or near forests, rely on them for their livelihoods and cultural survival, and are among the first to feel the effects when these landscapes burn.

Despite all this, the issue of forest and wildfires was largely ignored at COP25. The scale of emissions, the health impacts, the harm to communities and Indigenous Peoples, and the acceleration of climate breakdown did not receive the attention they demand from global leaders.

The message is clear: leaders must act. That means fully accounting for fire emissions, recognizing their true climate impact, addressing the drivers of these fires, and supporting affected communities and Indigenous Peoples. Ignoring this crisis in international climate negotiations only deepens the damage—to forests, to the climate, and to people on the frontlines.
