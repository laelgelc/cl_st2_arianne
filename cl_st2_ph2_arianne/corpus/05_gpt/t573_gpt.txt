Deep sea mining companies are working hard to sell a story: that scraping the ocean floor for minerals is a clean, responsible answer to the world’s demand for renewable energy and new technology. But their claims don’t stand up to scrutiny. When we look closely at what’s being promised, three central myths emerge – and each one hides serious risks for the climate, for people, and for our oceans.

The first myth is that deep sea mining is a “green” solution that will help power the transition to renewables and electric vehicles. Companies argue that metals from the seabed are needed for batteries and other clean energy technologies. What they leave out is the potential climate damage. The deep ocean floor isn’t just a pile of rocks – it’s a vast, living system that stores immense amounts of carbon in its sediments. Disturbing these sediments through mining could release stored carbon back into the water column and potentially into the atmosphere, undermining the very climate goals these companies claim to support. Turning one of the planet’s largest carbon stores into an industrial extraction zone is the opposite of a precautionary climate strategy.

The second myth is that deep sea mining is a humane alternative to land-based mining and a way to avoid the human rights abuses associated with it. This narrative pretends that simply moving extraction out of sight, into the deep ocean, makes it less harmful. But deep sea mining would create new risks for people and communities, especially those who rely on the ocean for food, livelihoods and cultural identity. Damage to marine ecosystems can ripple out into fisheries and coastal economies, threatening the rights and wellbeing of ocean-dependent communities. Shifting the location of extraction does not solve the underlying problem of an economic model built on ever-expanding resource use.

The third myth is that minerals from the seabed are essential for modern technology like smartphones and other consumer electronics. Deep sea mining companies often invoke our dependence on gadgets to justify opening up the ocean floor. Yet this claim is not backed up by the IT sector itself. Technology companies are not demanding deep sea minerals as a necessity for their products. Using the popularity of smartphones and digital devices to push a new frontier of extraction is a marketing tactic, not a technological requirement.

There is another path. Instead of treating the deep ocean as the next sacrifice zone, we can redesign our economies to use far fewer new metals in the first place. A circular economy approach prioritises reducing overall metal use, designing products to last longer, and dramatically scaling up repair, reuse and high-quality recycling. This would cut demand for new extraction while still meeting the needs of a renewable energy and digital transition.

Tech giants have a particularly important role to play. By committing to avoid deep sea minerals in their supply chains, investing in circular design, and driving innovation in recycling and resource efficiency, they can help protect the oceans while still delivering the products and services people rely on. Their choices can either fuel a new wave of risky extraction, or demonstrate that a thriving, low-carbon, high-tech future is possible without turning the deep sea into a mining zone.

Deep sea mining is not a green shortcut to a clean energy future. It’s a dangerous distraction from the real solutions: using less, reusing more, and building an economy that respects planetary boundaries – including the largely unknown, irreplaceable ecosystems of the deep ocean.
