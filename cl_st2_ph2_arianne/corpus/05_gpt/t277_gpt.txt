The climate crisis is no longer a distant warning; it is unfolding in real time. The latest IPCC report makes clear that we are in an intensifying emergency, and the evidence is all around us: wildfires tearing through landscapes, floods destroying homes and livelihoods, and relentless heatwaves pushing people and ecosystems to their limits. These impacts are not isolated incidents. They are interconnected signals of a world under stress, and they demand urgent action.

In this context, images have become a crucial part of how we understand and respond to climate breakdown. Photography can make the crisis visible and immediate, but the way it is done matters. There is a growing recognition that endlessly shocking or catastrophic imagery can overwhelm people, making them feel powerless rather than motivated to act. Instead, photographers are working to create images that are honest and engaging—pictures that draw people in, spark conversations, and allow viewers to connect emotionally without turning away.

This approach often begins with personal stories. One photographer documents the dramatic shrinkage of Lake Urmia, once one of the largest saltwater lakes in the Middle East. Its receding shoreline and exposed lakebed are not just environmental facts; they are part of a lived reality for communities whose identities and livelihoods are bound to the water. Another photographer focuses on Sri Lanka, where environmental threats are reshaping both land and sea. Through these images, viewers see more than “climate impacts”—they see people, cultures, and ecosystems in transition.

In the Arctic, photographers follow scientists at work in one of the world’s most rapidly warming regions. Their images capture research in action: instruments on the ice, field camps under changing skies, and the subtle, unsettling transformations in the landscape. These photographs help translate scientific findings into human-scale stories, making the data and warnings of the IPCC more tangible.

Alongside these narratives, photographers are reflecting on how media attention has shifted over time. Certain climate stories rise briefly to prominence and then fade, while others struggle to be seen at all. This uneven coverage shapes how the public understands the crisis—what is considered urgent, who is visible, and whose experiences are overlooked. In response, many photographers are striving for a balance: they want to convey the gravity of the situation without reducing it to despair, and to show not only damage and loss but also resilience, care, and the possibility of change.

The EverydayClimateChange project is one example of how this work is expanding. By growing beyond a single platform into exhibitions and YouTube, it is reaching new audiences and creating more spaces for dialogue. Viewers can encounter climate stories in galleries, community venues, and online, often in ways that invite reflection rather than passive consumption. The project’s growth underscores the power of collaborative, global storytelling in a time when the climate crisis touches every region and community.

For Greenpeace, this commitment to visual storytelling is part of a broader principle: bearing witness. To bear witness is to be present, to document, and to refuse to look away from environmental harm and injustice. It is about showing what is happening—whether in drying lakes, threatened coastlines, burning forests, or thawing ice—and insisting that these realities cannot be ignored.

As the IPCC warns of narrowing windows for action, the role of photography is not merely to illustrate the crisis, but to help drive change. Honest, empathetic images can connect the science to everyday life, bridge distances between places and people, and remind us that behind every data point is a story. By bearing witness and sharing these stories, photographers, activists, and communities together can help turn awareness into the urgent action this moment demands.
