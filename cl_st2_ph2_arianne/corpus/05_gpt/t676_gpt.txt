In a landmark moment for climate justice, the Urgenda Foundation has won again in Dutch courts, with the Court of Appeal upholding a 2015 ruling that requires the Netherlands to cut greenhouse gas emissions by at least 25% from 1990 levels by 2020. With the country having achieved only a 13% reduction so far, this ruling makes clear that the Dutch government must take stronger and faster action, including shutting down its remaining coal plants.

This decision does more than set a national climate target. It confirms that courts can and must play a role in enforcing governments’ human rights obligations in the face of climate change. By recognizing that inadequate climate policies can lead to human rights harms, the ruling sends a clear message: failing to act on climate is not only a political failure, but a legal one.

The timing of the decision, coming as the IPCC releases its 1.5°C report, underscores its urgency. The science shows how narrow the window is to keep warming to 1.5°C, and the Dutch case shows that governments that ignore this science may now face legal consequences. It is a warning to governments around the world to bring their climate policies in line with what is needed, or risk being taken to court.

This Dutch victory is part of a growing global wave of climate litigation. Around the world, communities and citizens are turning to the law to demand protection from climate harms. Swiss seniors are taking action to defend themselves from climate-related health risks. Young people in the United States are challenging their government over its role in driving the climate crisis. In the Philippines, investigations are examining the responsibility of fossil fuel companies for climate impacts.

Together, these cases show that people are no longer willing to accept weak promises or delayed action. They are using legal avenues to demand real, enforceable commitments to protect their rights and their futures. The Urgenda ruling stands as a powerful example of what is possible when courts recognize that climate inaction violates fundamental obligations—and it is a clear signal that more such cases are likely to follow.
