Thirty years after the world’s governments first came together under the UN Climate Agreement, the latest IPCC report could not be clearer: it is “now or never” if we are to limit global heating to 1.5°C under the Paris Agreement.

Yet, in the years since governments signed up to that goal, many have continued to approve new oil and gas projects. These decisions fly in the face of climate science that shows clearly how additional fossil fuel expansion is incompatible with keeping warming to 1.5°C. Instead of planning a rapid phase-out of coal, oil and gas, leaders are still doubling down on the very industries driving the crisis.

In response, more than 1,000 scientists across 25 countries have taken the extraordinary step of protesting. Their message is simple and urgent: stop ignoring the science. In the UK, scientists have also taken action against new licensing for oil and gas, highlighting how these plans clash with what the IPCC says is needed.

The report underlines a stark reality: three decades on from the first global climate agreement, global emissions still have not peaked. To keep 1.5°C within reach, emissions can’t just level off at some point in the future – they must start declining now and be reduced by 2025. Every year of delay makes the task harder and the impacts more severe.

But the report is not only a warning; it is also a roadmap. It shows that we already have the tools to halve global emissions within just eight years. Many of these solutions come at low cost – and some even at negative cost – meaning they can save money as well as cut pollution. A major reason this is possible is the rapid progress of renewable energy: solar and wind power have become increasingly affordable and are now outcompeting fossil fuels in many places.

The choice facing governments could not be more stark or more urgent. They can continue approving new fossil fuel projects that lock in decades of emissions, or they can act on the science, accelerate the shift to renewables and make use of the solutions that are already at our fingertips.

Acting on the science means listening to the warnings of the IPCC, heeding the courage of the scientists taking to the streets, and demanding that leaders stop expanding fossil fuels and start delivering the rapid cuts in emissions that the climate crisis demands.
