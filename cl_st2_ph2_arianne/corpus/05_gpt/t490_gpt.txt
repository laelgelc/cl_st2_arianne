Air pollution from burning fossil fuels is poisoning the air we breathe and heating our planet at the same time. The smoke, gases and particles released when we burn coal, petrol and diesel don’t just stay in the sky – they end up in our lungs, our bloodstreams and our homes, while also trapping heat in the atmosphere and driving climate change.

Coal is the worst offender. When it’s burned, it releases huge amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2), the main greenhouse gas heating our planet. But the damage doesn’t stop there. Coal combustion also emits toxic substances like mercury and arsenic, along with soot and fine particles that can penetrate deep into our lungs. These pollutants harm our hearts and lungs and increase the risk of stroke. Despite this, coal still powers more than a third of the world’s electricity, locking us into a cycle of illness and climate disruption.

The way out is clear: we need to move rapidly away from coal and other fossil fuels and towards renewable energy. Wind and solar power generate electricity without producing the toxic air pollution that comes from burning coal. They also avoid the CO2 emissions that destabilise our climate. In recent years, there has been real progress, with more wind and solar projects being built and connected to power grids around the world. Every new turbine and solar panel is a step away from coal smoke and towards cleaner air.

Cars and trucks running on petrol and diesel are another major source of air pollution and climate-heating emissions. Their exhaust pipes release CO2 as well as nitrogen dioxide (NO2), a gas that irritates airways, worsens asthma and contributes to dangerous smog in cities. The more vehicles we have on the road and the more they are used, the worse the air becomes for everyone who lives, works or goes to school nearby.

Transforming our transport systems is essential. That means designing cities so that people don’t need to rely on private cars in the first place. Car-free options like reliable, affordable public transport, safe cycling infrastructure and walkable neighbourhoods can cut both pollution and emissions. When people have attractive alternatives to driving, traffic falls, air gets cleaner and streets become safer and more livable.

Electric vehicles (EVs) can also play a role, but how they are produced and powered matters. To truly reduce pollution and climate impact, EVs need to run on electricity generated from renewable sources like wind and solar, not from coal-fired power stations. They should also be made smaller and more efficient, using fewer resources, and be shared through car clubs and other systems so that fewer vehicles are needed overall. A future with fewer, cleaner, shared vehicles alongside strong public transport and cycling is far better than simply swapping every petrol car for a large electric one.

Real change is already happening when communities come together to demand clean air and a safe climate. In China, public pressure and local action have contributed to cleaner urban transport, including the roll-out of electrified buses that reduce exhaust fumes on busy streets. In Belgium, people have pushed for and won car bans in certain areas, reclaiming streets for pedestrians, cyclists and public life instead of traffic and tailpipes. In Turkey, community mobilisations have helped stop coal power plant projects, preventing new sources of toxic pollution and climate emissions before they could be built.

These examples show that collective action works. When residents, workers, health professionals, parents and young people organise and speak out, they can reshape energy and transport systems in ways that protect health and the climate. Ending our dependence on coal, petrol and diesel is not just a technical challenge – it is a social and political one. By standing together, communities can clean up the air, cut climate pollution and build cities and energy systems that put people’s wellbeing first.
