In 2020, the MV Wakashio ran aground off the coast of Mauritius, leaking 1,000 tonnes of fuel into a lagoon near a marine reserve. The spill devastated local communities and marine life, contaminating fragile coastal ecosystems and threatening the livelihoods of people who depend on the ocean for food and income. It was a stark reminder that when heavy, dirty fuels are used in or near vulnerable marine areas, the consequences can be long-lasting and severe.

Disasters like this highlight the urgent need to ban dangerous fuels in fragile regions, including the Arctic. These areas are already under immense pressure from the climate crisis and are often home to unique and sensitive ecosystems. Continuing to power global shipping with fossil fuels in such places puts entire communities and habitats at risk.

At the same time, the broader climate impact of shipping cannot be ignored. The sector emits around 1 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent every year, more than twice the annual emissions of the UK. Despite this, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) has backtracked on the commitments it made in 2018 to cut emissions in line with the Paris Agreement. Instead of accelerating action, the IMO is failing to respond to the climate emergency, leaving a major global source of emissions largely unchecked.

This inaction reinforces the need to transform shipping away from fossil fuels altogether. Reducing and ultimately eliminating the sector’s dependence on oil-based fuels is essential if we are to protect vulnerable regions, limit global heating and avoid further disasters like the one in Mauritius.

Strengthening global ocean governance is also critical. A strong Global Ocean Treaty in 2021 is needed to improve accountability and ensure that conservation is placed above exploitation. Such a treaty should help close the gaps that allow destructive activities at sea to continue with little oversight, and make it possible to better protect marine reserves and high seas ecosystems from pollution, overuse and neglect.

The MV Wakashio spill exposed how fragile marine environments are when faced with fossil fuel pollution, and how communities pay the price when governance fails. Ending the use of dangerous fuels in sensitive areas, shifting shipping away from fossil fuels, and securing a robust Global Ocean Treaty are all essential steps to put ocean protection and climate action at the heart of how we use and manage the seas.
