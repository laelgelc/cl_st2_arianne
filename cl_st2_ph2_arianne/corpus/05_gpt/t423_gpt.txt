Knock, knock.  
Who’s there?  
Climate change.  
Climate change who?  
Climate change – still here, still knocking, and not going away.

While the world’s attention has rightly been focused on the COVID-19 pandemic, climate change has not gone into lockdown. It hasn’t self-isolated, taken a break, or waited politely in the background. It has continued, relentlessly, to reshape lives, livelihoods and landscapes. The danger now is that as societies look towards economic recovery, we simply reopen the door to the same fossil-fuelled path that led us here in the first place.

There is no Planet B. Protecting this one means refusing to slide back into “business as usual” levels of coal, oil and gas use. The temptation to double down on fossil fuels in the name of a fast economic rebound is strong, but the cost is already being counted in flooded homes, ruined harvests and shattered communities.

Recent floods across Asia and Africa are a stark reminder that climate change is not a future threat; it is a present reality.

In South Asia, annual floods are becoming more intense and more destructive. This year alone, 9.6 million people have been affected across the region. In China, 37.89 million people have been impacted by severe flooding, with evacuations in provinces such as Anhui and Hubei displacing around 10,000 people. In Bangladesh, about one-third of the country has been submerged, affecting 2.8 million people. Across the border in India’s northeast, 6.8 million people have been hit by floodwaters. Nepal, Indonesia and Japan have also suffered devastating floods, with communities facing loss of life, homes and critical infrastructure.

The story is similar in East Africa. In Kenya, floods during May and June displaced thousands of people, caused deaths and wiped out crops and livestock. These disasters are unfolding against a backdrop of intensifying extreme weather in East Africa linked to the climate crisis, deepening existing vulnerabilities and pushing communities further to the brink.

These are not isolated incidents. Taken together, they show a pattern of worsening climate impacts in a world that is already more than 1°C warmer than pre-industrial times. The same fossil fuels that powered the old “normal” are driving these extremes.

As societies emerge from the pandemic, we face a choice. We can rebuild in a way that locks in more pollution, more warming and more climate chaos. Or we can use this moment to shift towards safer, cleaner and more resilient ways of living that respect the limits of our only home.

Climate change will keep knocking. The question is whether we answer with the same harmful habits, or with the courage to change course and protect the one planet we have.
