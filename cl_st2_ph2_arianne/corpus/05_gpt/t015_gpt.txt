Scrolling social media, it’s easy to see why tinned tuna is having a moment. Cheap, convenient and protein-packed, it’s become the star of viral trends like #TinnedFishDateNight. For many people facing rising food prices, tuna feels like a smart, accessible staple.

But behind the glossy recipes and neatly stacked cans lies a reality that is far from appetising. Greenpeace investigations and reports such as *Choppy Waters* have exposed the severe human and environmental costs hidden in much of the global tuna trade.

On distant-water fishing vessels, crew members can face extreme working conditions. Testimonies gathered in Greenpeace research describe 20-hour workdays, with people pushed to the point of exhaustion. Nutrition on board is often poor, leaving workers hungry and weakened even as they carry out grueling physical labour. Wages may be withheld or delayed, trapping workers in debt and dependency. In some cases, passports are confiscated, preventing people from leaving abusive situations and making it nearly impossible to return home. These are hallmarks of forced labour, not decent work.

The environmental toll is just as alarming. Tuna is one of the world’s most popular seafoods, and the pressure on wild populations is intense. Around a third of tuna stocks are fished unsustainably, meaning they are being caught faster than they can reproduce. This overfishing threatens the long-term survival of tuna populations and the livelihoods of coastal communities that depend on them.

The way tuna is caught also matters. Industrial methods like longlining and purse seining, especially when used with fish aggregating devices (FADs), are highly destructive. Longlines can stretch for kilometres, bristling with baited hooks that don’t just catch tuna, but also ensnare sharks, seabirds and other marine animals. Purse seine nets deployed around FADs can trap huge schools of fish along with turtles, juvenile tuna and many other species. This “bycatch” is often discarded dead or dying, a massive and largely invisible waste of marine life.

The boom in tinned tuna demand, amplified by online trends, risks driving even more of this destructive fishing unless we change course. Consumers have more power than it might seem. Choosing tuna from more sustainable sources, such as products clearly labelled as pole-and-line or handline caught, can help reduce pressure on overfished stocks and cut down on bycatch. Looking for brands that commit to strong human rights standards and independent monitoring on vessels is also critical.

But individual choices alone are not enough. Governments must step up with strong, enforceable rules to protect both people and the oceans. That means cracking down on forced labour and other abuses at sea, requiring full transparency in fishing operations, and managing tuna fisheries based on science, not short-term profit. It also means phasing out the most destructive fishing practices and protecting critical marine habitats.

Tuna can remain a nutritious, affordable food – but not at the cost of human dignity and ocean health. By demanding better from brands and retailers, and by pressing governments to enforce ethical, sustainable fisheries management, we can help ensure that a simple can of tuna no longer comes with such a heavy hidden price.
