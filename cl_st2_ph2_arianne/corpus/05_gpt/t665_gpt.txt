2018 has been marked as the climate year, with devastating fires, soaring temperatures, and powerful hurricanes underscoring the urgency of the crisis. The latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has confirmed that the world is changing fast—and that the situation will worsen without rapid, far-reaching action.

Amid this backdrop, some of the countries most vulnerable to climate impacts are stepping up to show what real climate leadership looks like. The Climate Vulnerable Forum (CVF), a coalition of nations on the frontlines of climate change, is holding a Virtual Summit hosted by the Marshall Islands. This online gathering highlights how those who have contributed least to the problem are among the first to act decisively.

The Marshall Islands is using the summit to spotlight its own ambitious path: a plan to transition to 100% renewable energy and reach net-zero emissions by 2050. This commitment demonstrates that even small, climate-vulnerable states are willing to align their development with a safer climate future.

The CVF has already played a pivotal role in shaping global climate policy. Its member countries helped influence the Paris Agreement and the adoption of the 1.5-degree Celsius temperature goal, which has become a key benchmark for limiting the worst climate impacts. By pushing for this more ambitious target, the forum has helped shift the global conversation toward the level of action science demands.

Taking place just before COP24, the CVF Virtual Summit is a direct call to the world’s major polluters and governments. It urges them to match and exceed the ambition shown by vulnerable countries, and to act with the urgency that the climate crisis requires.
