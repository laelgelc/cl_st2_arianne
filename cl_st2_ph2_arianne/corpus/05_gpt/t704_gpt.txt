“If your pictures aren’t good enough, you’re not close enough.”

Robert Capa’s famous advice wasn’t only about distance to a subject; it was about commitment, courage, and care. On World Photography Day, 19 August, that idea feels especially powerful. Photography is at once deeply personal and completely public: a way of seeing that belongs to one person, yet can move millions.

As a medium, photography has always been about bearing witness. Since its origins in the 19th century, when long exposures fixed landscapes and portraits onto glass and metal, the camera has been a tool to say: “This is what is happening. Look.” Over more than 200 years, images have been used in courtrooms as evidence, and in streets and parliaments as sparks for public outrage and political change.

That history is also the story of photography as an ally to movements for justice. Environmental movements have long relied on photographs to speak across borders and languages. A single frame can cut through jargon and statistics, making the abstract brutally concrete and the distant suddenly intimate. You don’t need to share a language to understand a wounded animal, a poisoned river, or a forest reduced to ash.

Working as Multimedia Editor for Greenpeace International in Hong Kong, I see this every day. The camera is not neutral: where we stand, what we choose to show or exclude, and how close we dare to get, all shape how people understand the climate and environmental crises. But when we use it with honesty and respect, photography becomes a universal language of urgency and hope.

To celebrate World Photography Day, we are sharing 12 images from Greenpeace’s history that show what it means to get close.

There is a turtle ensnared in plastic, its body twisted and constrained by a material designed to last far longer than any creature’s lifetime. In that one image, the sprawling problem of plastic pollution becomes heartbreakingly intimate. It’s no longer about “millions of tonnes” of waste; it’s about one animal that cannot free itself.

Another photograph shows a whale, its body bloodied, captured in the split second where violence becomes undeniable. Images like this helped galvanise public outrage and contributed to the push for whaling bans. People who had never seen a whale in their lives suddenly felt implicated in its fate.

In the aftermath of oil spills, photographers have documented pelicans soaked in crude, their feathers matted, eyes barely visible under the sludge. These are not abstract “impacts on biodiversity”; they are living beings transformed into symbols of a reckless industry and the true cost of fossil fuels.

From above, a different kind of wound is visible: vast stretches of deforested land in Indonesia. The forest canopy, once dense and alive, is replaced by emptiness or monotonous plantations. These photographs show the scale of destruction that words often fail to convey, revealing how quickly centuries-old ecosystems can be erased.

Photography has also followed people on the frontlines of resistance. At Standing Rock, images of protesters facing down powerful interests made visible a struggle for water, land, and Indigenous rights. The faces, the weathered hands holding signs, the silhouettes against the horizon: all these details remind us that environmental battles are always human stories too.

And then there is the image of a woman standing victorious against a coal company: a single person embodying the power of determined communities. Her stance, her expression, the context around her – they all speak to the idea that no corporation is too big to be challenged, and that ordinary people can win.

Each of these 12 photographs, in its own way, asks us to come closer. Not just with our eyes, but with our attention, our empathy, and our willingness to act. They show damage and injustice, but they also reveal courage, solidarity, and the possibility of change.

On this World Photography Day, we honour the photographers who have risked their safety to document what some would prefer to keep hidden, and the communities who have allowed their stories to be told. Their images travel further than any one of us can, crossing borders and screens to reach people who might never attend a protest or read a scientific report.

But seeing is only the first step. The true power of photography lies in what we do after we put the camera down or close the browser tab. Every one of these images is an invitation: to learn more, to speak up, to stand with those on the frontlines, and to help write the next chapter of this visual history.

The environmental movement needs more witnesses, more storytellers, more people willing to get close – to the truth, to each other, and to the living world we’re trying to protect.
