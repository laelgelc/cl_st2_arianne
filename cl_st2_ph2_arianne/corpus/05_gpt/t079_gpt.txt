Across the world, the phrase “just transition” has become central to conversations about climate action. It usually refers to ensuring that workers and communities dependent on fossil fuels are supported as economies move toward cleaner energy. But a truly just transition must go further. It must also confront the long, painful legacy of pollution left behind by the old system—especially in communities that have borne its heaviest burdens for decades.

South Durban in South Africa illustrates what this legacy looks like in people’s daily lives. Residents there live with a toxic combination of poverty, illness, and ongoing air pollution from industrial sources. Even as the global energy system begins to change, these communities continue to breathe dirty air, grapple with chronic health problems, and struggle with the social and economic hardships that pollution has helped entrench.

Research shows that the harms of pollution do not exist in isolation. Social determinants—such as income, housing, access to healthcare, nutrition, and education—interact with environmental exposures to amplify health risks. When people already face economic and social disadvantage, pollution hits harder. It can worsen existing conditions, increase vulnerability to new illnesses, and reduce people’s ability to recover and thrive.

These effects begin before birth. Studies have linked in-utero exposure to pollution with impacts on children’s lung, heart, and brain development. The consequences are not just physical. Neurocognitive outcomes such as reduced IQ have been associated with these early exposures, shaping a child’s prospects long before they have any control over their environment.

This creates a generational cycle of disadvantage. Children growing up in polluted, under-resourced communities may face health challenges that affect their schooling and future opportunities. As they become adults, they may remain in the same neighbourhoods, exposed to the same industrial emissions and social stressors, and the cycle repeats. Even when some pollutants are reduced, the accumulated damage to health and opportunity can continue across generations.

The Covid-19 pandemic laid bare how these combined inequities play out in real time. Communities already burdened by pollution and poverty faced higher risks and worse outcomes. The virus did not create these vulnerabilities; it exposed and intensified the structural injustices that were already there.

A just transition that focuses only on the future of energy production, without addressing the communities still living in the shadow of past and present pollution, will leave these injustices intact. Justice demands that we recognise and respond to the full picture: the social conditions that magnify environmental harm, the lifelong and even in-utero impacts of pollution, and the generational cycles of disadvantage that result.

As the world moves away from fossil fuels, the voices and experiences of places like South Durban must be at the centre of decision-making. A transition that heals, rather than simply replaces one system with another, must clean up existing pollution, reduce ongoing exposures, and tackle the social determinants that make some communities far more vulnerable than others. Only then can the promise of a just transition become a lived reality for all.
