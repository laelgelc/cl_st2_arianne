Marks & Spencer has taken an important step towards a toxic-free future by committing to eliminate all hazardous chemical releases from its supply chain and products by 2020. This move marks a significant milestone in efforts to protect waterways and communities from dangerous pollution linked to the fashion industry.

As part of this commitment, M&S will phase out perfluorocarbons (PFCs) by July 1, 2016. PFCs have been widely used in water- and stain-resistant clothing, and their removal from production is a crucial step towards reducing hazardous discharges into the environment. In addition, M&S will reinforce a ban on APEOs and set clear timelines for phasing out other priority chemicals from its supply chain.

Transparency is a central element of the company’s pledge. M&S will publish discharge data from five of its suppliers in China, providing the public with access to information about chemical releases linked to its production. The company also plans to expand this disclosure beyond the initial five suppliers, further opening up its supply chain to public scrutiny.

By making this commitment, Marks & Spencer becomes the seventh major brand to join others such as Puma, Nike, Adidas, H&M, C&A, and Li-Ning in taking concrete steps to detoxify their production. This growing group of companies is helping to set a new standard for the clothing industry, showing that it is both possible and necessary to move away from hazardous chemicals and towards safer alternatives.

These commitments demonstrate that determined action by brands can drive real change in how clothing is made and how our rivers and waterways are protected. Greenpeace is calling on more brands to follow this example, publicly commit to eliminating hazardous chemicals, and share their discharge data so that progress can be tracked openly.

People everywhere can help accelerate this shift by sharing information about these commitments, supporting companies that take meaningful action, and joining campaigns that demand a toxic-free future for fashion and the environment.
