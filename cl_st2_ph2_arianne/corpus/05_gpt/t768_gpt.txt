In the early 1990s, refrigerators were quietly contributing to two global crises at once. The fluorinated gases (F-gases) used in cooling systems were not only destroying the ozone layer, they were also powerful greenhouse gases driving climate change. At the time, a handful of major chemical companies controlled this technology and the market, and there was little incentive to change.

In 1992, Greenpeace decided to challenge that status quo. Our German team set out to show that a safe, efficient and climate-friendly alternative was possible. Working with the company Foron, they developed a new kind of refrigerator that used natural hydrocarbons as the cooling agent instead of F-gases. This technology became known as GreenFreeze.

GreenFreeze was more than just a technical innovation; it was a direct challenge to the chemical industry’s monopoly over refrigeration technology. To prove there was real demand for a cleaner option, supporters stepped up in a powerful way. Around 70,000 people placed pre-orders for the new fridge, sending a clear signal that the public wanted an alternative. On the strength of this support, the first GreenFreeze unit rolled off the production line in 1993.

The impact was rapid. Within a year, European manufacturers began adopting the technology. Recognising its potential to reduce both ozone damage and greenhouse gas emissions, Greenpeace made the GreenFreeze design open source so that any company could use it without paying licensing fees. This decision helped speed up global uptake and removed a major barrier for manufacturers who wanted to shift away from F-gases.

The significance of GreenFreeze was recognised internationally when it received an award from the United Nations. Over time, what started as a challenge to an entrenched industry became a new global standard. Today, around one billion GreenFreeze refrigerators are in use worldwide. By 2020, nearly 80% of annual refrigerator production was expected to be based on this technology.

GreenFreeze shows how determined campaigning, public support and open, accessible innovation can transform an entire industry. What began as a response to ozone depletion and climate pollution has grown into one of the world’s most widespread examples of truly climate-friendly technology in everyday life.
