As governments meet under the umbrella of the International Seabed Authority (ISA) to finalize regulations for commercial deep sea mining, a critical question looms: why push ahead with an industry that threatens some of the least understood ecosystems on Earth, when evidence shows we don’t need to?

For years, mining companies and some governments have argued that deep sea minerals are essential for renewable energy technologies. But this claim has been refuted by reports showing that terrestrial mineral resources are sufficient to meet the needs of the energy transition. In other words, the rationale that we must mine the deep ocean to enable renewables does not hold up against the available evidence.

Despite this, the ISA is moving toward opening the deep ocean to commercial extraction. The risks are profound. Mining in these fragile, largely unexplored environments could cause severe and potentially permanent damage: destruction of habitats that have taken millennia to form, and loss of biodiversity we are only beginning to discover. Once these deep sea ecosystems are disturbed, there is no realistic path to restoration on human timescales.

The way decisions are being made is also deeply troubling. The ISA has been criticized for its lack of transparency and recently rejected the creation of an environmental committee that could have strengthened environmental oversight. At the same time, it has already approved 28 exploration contracts, granting companies and states access to enormous areas of the international seabed in preparation for potential future mining.

On the water, in communities, and in political institutions, resistance is growing. In Papua New Guinea, local communities have strongly opposed Nautilus Minerals’ Solwara project, a proposed deep sea mining operation in the Bismarck Sea. Their resistance reflects fears about damage to marine ecosystems, fisheries, and ways of life that are intimately tied to the ocean.

At the political level, the European Parliament has called for a moratorium on deep sea mining, reflecting mounting concern among lawmakers about the environmental and social risks. Around the world, public opposition is also swelling: 800,000 people have already added their names to calls for a ban on deep sea mining, demanding that governments protect these still-unexplored ecosystems instead of turning them into the next frontier of industrial extraction.

The choice now facing the international community is stark. With evidence that we can meet renewable energy needs without plundering the deep seabed, and with clear warnings about irreversible environmental harm, pushing ahead with deep sea mining is a political decision, not an ecological necessity. The growing movement of communities, parliamentarians, and hundreds of thousands of concerned people worldwide is sending a clear message: the deep ocean should be safeguarded, not sacrificed.
