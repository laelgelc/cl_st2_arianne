The fight for climate justice is inseparable from the fight for global equality. Around the world, women are at the forefront of protecting our climate and environment, pushing for a future in which people and planet can thrive together. When we talk about “women” in this context, we explicitly include trans, non-binary, and cisgender individuals whose work, courage, and creativity are driving change every single day.

Across Greenpeace, women are shaping campaigns, building communities, and confronting the systems that fuel both the climate crisis and social injustice. Their daily work is as diverse as the places they come from: organizing actions, telling powerful stories, supporting teams behind the scenes, and connecting people across borders and movements. They are not only resisting destruction, but actively imagining and creating fairer, greener ways of living.

On International Women’s Day – and far beyond this one date – we celebrate these women and their leadership. From every corner of the Greenpeace network, women have shared personal insights into what they do each day for climate and environmental protection, and what changes they want to see in the world. Their voices underline a simple truth: there can be no climate justice without gender justice, and no sustainable future that excludes those most affected by the crisis and most engaged in solving it.

Readers are invited to be part of this celebration and reflection: to think about the women who inspire them, to share those inspirations with others, and to listen directly to the people behind the work. Fifty video messages from women in Greenpeace worldwide offer a window into their motivations, struggles, and hopes. Each message is a reminder that global transformation is built on countless acts of care, resistance, and solidarity.

Among those featured are three women from Greenpeace Germany’s “50 Years Greenpeace International” team. As Project Assistant, Elena Keil helps keep complex work moving, supporting the structures that allow campaigns and storytelling to reach people across the globe. Content producer and filmmaker Anabela Angelovska brings environmental struggles and victories to screens, making the climate crisis and the movements confronting it visible and tangible. Online editor Karla Stretz helps connect audiences with Greenpeace’s stories and campaigns in the digital space, ensuring that information, inspiration, and opportunities for action are just a click away.

Their contributions, alongside those of so many others, show how the climate movement is strengthened when diverse experiences and identities are centered and valued. By listening to these voices, sharing their stories, and standing with them in action, we can move closer to a world where climate protection and equality go hand in hand – not just on International Women’s Day, but every day.
