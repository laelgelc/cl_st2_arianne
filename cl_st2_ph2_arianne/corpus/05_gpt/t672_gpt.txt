Sápmi stretches across the northern parts of Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Russia, and for the Sámi people it is far more than a place on a map. As Sámi artist and activist Jenni Laiti describes, the land itself shapes their culture, spirit, and survival. Their identity is inseparable from the forests, the reindeer, and the seasonal cycles that have guided Sámi life for generations.

Today, that land is under intense pressure from government and corporate exploitation. Mines and large-scale logging are already eating into vital ecosystems. Now, a proposed Arctic Railway threatens to cut even deeper. Promoted as a way to expand global trade through new shipping routes opened by melting sea ice, the railway would slice through Sápmi, physically dividing the land and the communities who depend on it.

For the Sámi, the consequences would be profound. Reindeer migration routes would be disrupted, with animals facing new barriers and dangers. The risk of accidents on the tracks would grow, and the disturbance from trains and infrastructure would further stress already vulnerable herds. Reindeer are not only a cornerstone of Sámi livelihoods, but also central to their culture and identity.

The Arctic Railway is also likely to accelerate a wider wave of industrialization. New transport links would make it easier and cheaper to expand pulp mills, logging operations, and other resource extraction in the region. This would mean the destruction of more forests that are essential both for reindeer grazing and for the continuity of Sámi culture.

Jenni Laiti connects these local struggles to global climate science. She points to the warnings from the IPCC about the accelerating climate crisis, and how projects that destroy forests and expand fossil-fuelled trade directly undermine efforts to stabilize the climate. Protecting the forests of Sápmi is not only about safeguarding Sámi rights and ways of life; it is also about protecting ecosystems that the whole world depends on.

Her message is a call for collective action. Defending Sápmi’s forests and resisting destructive projects like the Arctic Railway is part of the broader struggle for global survival in the face of climate change.
