Cities are at the heart of the climate crisis—and at the heart of the solution. As the places where most people live, work, and move, they shape our daily lives and our collective future. The choices made by city leaders and residents today will determine whether our urban spaces become hotter, more polluted, and more unequal—or healthier, fairer, and more resilient.

More than half of the world’s population—55%—already lives in cities, and this is expected to rise to 68% by 2050. At the same time, cities are responsible for around 70% of global emissions. That means urban areas are both highly vulnerable to climate impacts and absolutely central to cutting the pollution driving the crisis.

Climate change is already magnifying existing urban problems. Pollution, inequality, and extreme heat are combining to create dangerous conditions for millions of people. In particular, heatwaves are becoming more intense and frequent, and projections show that European cities will face rising temperatures and longer, more severe heatwaves in the years ahead. These impacts hit hardest in neighborhoods with fewer resources, less green space, and poorer access to services—deepening social and environmental injustice.

But cities also offer some of the most immediate and practical opportunities to protect both planetary and human health. Resilient urban action is possible right now. That means:

- Expanding and improving public transport so that moving around the city is clean, affordable, and accessible for everyone.  
- Building safe, connected bike lanes so more people can choose cycling as a healthy, low-carbon way to travel.  
- Ensuring local access to healthy, sustainable food so communities are less vulnerable to global shocks and can reduce the environmental footprint of what they eat.  
- Creating and protecting green spaces—parks, trees, community gardens—to cool overheated neighborhoods, clean the air, and provide places for people to rest, play, and connect.

These are not just environmental measures; they are public health measures, social justice measures, and economic measures. Green urban policies can help avoid enormous future costs. With bold action, cities worldwide could help save up to $17 trillion by 2050—money that would otherwise be lost to climate damage, health impacts, and failing infrastructure.

On World Cities Day, the message for governments and mayors is clear: delay is no longer an option. Every year of inaction locks in more risk for the people who live in cities and for the planet as a whole. Urban leaders must put climate and health at the center of every decision—transport, housing, food, energy, and public space—so that cities become places where people and nature can thrive together.

Citizens also have a crucial role. Demanding cleaner air, safer streets, better public transport, and more green spaces is demanding a livable future. By pushing for ambitious, resilient policies now, people in cities can help build sustainable, fair, and climate-safe urban futures for generations to come.
