When I first stepped onto the Rainbow Warrior in Venice, the city felt like a beautiful warning. Its palaces, churches and piazzas seemed to rise directly from the water, fragile and magnificent, while the science tells us that—without rapid action—places like this face more frequent flooding and, in the long run, the risk of being swallowed by the sea.

I was there to join Greenpeace on what we called the “Last Tour of Venice,” a peaceful protest to draw attention to exactly that: the existential threat climate change poses to this extraordinary city and countless others. As we moved through the canals, it was impossible not to think about what is driving this crisis: the continued extraction and burning of coal, oil and gas.

At the same time, the companies most responsible for this emergency are busy polishing their image. Oil and gas giants plaster their logos across museum walls, university lecture halls and sports stadiums. They sponsor exhibitions, scholarships and championships, hoping that culture, education and sport will rub off on them and that we’ll forget the damage they’re doing.

This is not generosity; it is greenwashing. It’s about maintaining a “social license to operate” so they can keep drilling, keep expanding, and keep profiting from fossil fuels while presenting themselves as part of the solution. The pleasant branding and glossy adverts stand in stark contrast to what the science makes painfully clear.

But there are cracks in this façade.

We’ve already seen powerful examples of institutions choosing a different path. Harvard University, after years of campaigning and pressure, committed to divesting from fossil fuels. In other cases, major cultural and educational institutions have decided to end their relationships with companies like BP and Santos, recognising that these sponsorships are incompatible with their values and with a safe climate.

These decisions matter. They show that public pressure works, and that it is possible to break the spell of fossil fuel influence in our public life.

The next step is to confront the advertising and public relations machinery that props up this industry. Just as many countries acted to restrict and ban tobacco advertising when the evidence of harm became undeniable, we now face a similar moment with fossil fuels. There is a growing movement in Europe to ban fossil fuel advertising and sponsorships, following the model used for tobacco. A European citizens’ initiative is pushing this forward, calling for an end to the glossy campaigns that obscure the true impact of coal, oil and gas.

This push is backed by a deepening understanding of how the fossil fuel industry has worked for decades to confuse the public and delay action. The IPCC has laid out how industry disinformation has distorted the climate conversation. In response to this, 450 scientists have taken the unusual step of directly urging PR and advertising agencies to stop working with fossil fuel clients, making it clear that helping these companies mislead the public is incompatible with climate science.

Standing on the deck of the Rainbow Warrior in Venice, surrounded by water and history, these threads come together. A city at risk. An industry that has known the dangers for decades. A sophisticated web of sponsorships and adverts designed to distract us. And, crucially, people and institutions choosing to say no.

Breaking the grip of fossil fuel greenwashing—whether in museums, universities, sports arenas or on our screens—is part of protecting places like Venice and safeguarding a livable future. The more we refuse to give fossil fuels a social license, the closer we get to the world the science tells us is still possible.
