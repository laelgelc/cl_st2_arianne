In the icy waters of the Barents Sea, a powerful act of resistance unfolded as Greenpeace activists from 25 countries confronted Arctic oil drilling at one of Norway’s northernmost drilling sites. The target was Statoil’s Korpfjell well, operated by the rig Songa Enabler, where Norway has pushed ahead with new oil exploration despite having ratified the Paris Agreement in 2016.

Activists sailed into the exclusion zone around the rig aboard the Greenpeace ship Arctic Sunrise. Once there, they attached a globe to the Songa Enabler, symbolically carrying messages from around the world demanding protection for the Arctic and a rapid shift away from fossil fuels. This peaceful action halted operations at the drilling site, directly challenging Norway’s decision to open up new areas of the Arctic to oil companies at a time when the world has committed to limiting global warming.

The Norwegian Coast Guard responded by arresting the activists, the crew, and the Arctic Sunrise itself. Yet the message they carried could not be detained: drilling for more oil in the Arctic is incompatible with the global climate commitments that Norway and other nations have made.

The confrontation at sea is part of a broader struggle that is now moving into the courtroom. Greenpeace Nordic and the youth organisation Nature and Youth are preparing to challenge Arctic oil drilling in court in November. They argue that granting new oil licenses in the Barents Sea contradicts Norway’s obligations under the Paris Agreement and threatens the fragile Arctic environment.

People around the world are being invited to stand with them. More than 350,000 witness statements have already been collected, amplifying the call to protect the Arctic and uphold climate commitments. By adding their voices, individuals can support this legal challenge and help show that the world is watching Norway’s choices in the Arctic.
