There is an African concept called “Ubuntu” that reminds us: “I am because we are.” It speaks to a universal bond that connects all people, and to the idea that our salvation—our survival, our joy, our future—can only be collective. In a world marked by deep inequalities and environmental destruction, Ubuntu offers a way to imagine a future where we care for one another and for the earth.

This spirit of shared humanity is at the heart of the Greenpeace Alternative Futures Project. Young artists from Zambia, South Africa, Chile, Kenya, Indonesia, Panama, and Australia came together to envision green, fair futures for their communities and the planet. They used artificial intelligence as a creative tool to bring their ideas to life, generating vivid images of what a more just and sustainable world could look like.

Their visions were rooted in diversity, community, and human potential. Some artists spoke about the power of seeing themselves and their cultures reflected in the futures they created. Others described how they drew inspiration from their own lives, their families, and their local struggles and hopes. For many, AI became a way to unlock and share ideas that might otherwise remain invisible, helping to democratize creativity by giving more people access to powerful tools for expression.

The artworks they produced are not just beautiful images; they are invitations. They invite us to see that another world is possible—a world where people live in balance with nature, where communities are strong, and where everyone has the chance to thrive. They show futures in which justice and environmental care are not competing goals, but deeply intertwined.

By daring to dream together, these young artists are practicing Ubuntu in action. They remind us that our futures are linked, and that imagining better worlds is a first step toward building them. Their work calls on all of us to join in: to dream boldly of a world that respects both people and the earth, and to act, together, to make those dreams real.
