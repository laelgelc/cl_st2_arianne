Romania’s transition away from coal is unfolding under the long shadow of the 1990s, when rushed mine closures and industrial restructuring left deep social scars. Regions like the Jiu Valley were hit especially hard, with massive job losses and the collapse of local economies built almost entirely around coal. For many communities, those years are remembered not only as an economic shock, but as a moment when people felt abandoned and stripped of their identity.

Today, as Romania prepares to phase out coal once again, the stakes are just as high—but the approach does not have to repeat past mistakes. Greenpeace Romania has been working to ensure that this transition is not only about shutting down mines and power plants, but about creating new opportunities and protecting people from energy poverty.

A central part of this vision is the idea of a just transition built on renewable energy, where former mining regions become pioneers of a new energy model. Instead of being left behind, coal workers and their communities can become active players in the energy system as prosumers—both producing and consuming electricity. In practice, this means supporting former miners and their families to install photovoltaic systems on their homes or community buildings, so that they can generate clean power, lower their bills, and even feed surplus electricity back into the grid.

This model goes beyond individual households. Greenpeace Romania promotes the creation of energy communities—local groups that collectively own or manage renewable energy installations. These communities can help preserve local identity by keeping energy projects rooted in the places that once depended on coal, and by ensuring that the benefits of renewables stay in the region. At the same time, they can play a crucial role in tackling energy poverty, making clean energy more accessible and affordable for vulnerable households.

These ideas have begun to influence public policy. Romanian authorities have taken up key elements of Greenpeace Romania’s proposals in the Just Transition Plans, which are financed through European Union programmes. The plans now include measures such as subsidies for household solar panels, enabling more families to become prosumers, and support for small-scale renewable installations on public buildings. Schools, hospitals, and other public institutions in former coal regions can thus lower their energy costs while contributing to local clean energy production.

The direction of travel is also being set at the national level. Romania has adopted a coal phaseout date of 2032 through the Decarbonisation Law, providing a formal timeline for ending coal use. This legal commitment creates both urgency and an opportunity: there is a clear horizon by which new economic and energy models must be in place for coal regions.

To make this transition work in practice, more is needed than targets on paper. Plans are underway for workshops that will help build the legal and regulatory frameworks required for energy communities and prosumers to thrive. These workshops aim to translate the concepts of just transition and community energy into concrete rules, procedures, and support schemes that people can actually use.

Romania’s coal regions stand at a crossroads once again. The experience of the 1990s shows what happens when transition is done to communities instead of with them. By centering renewables, empowering former miners as prosumers, and embedding these solutions in Just Transition Plans backed by EU funding, there is a real chance to write a different story—one in which the move beyond coal strengthens, rather than erases, the identity and resilience of the communities that powered the country for generations.
