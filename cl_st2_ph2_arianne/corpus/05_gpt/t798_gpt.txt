On International Human Rights Day, as the world approaches the 70th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the growing reality is impossible to ignore: climate change is a human rights crisis.

Communities on the frontlines of climate impacts are not just facing extreme weather, rising seas, and destroyed livelihoods. They are facing threats to their basic rights—to life, to health, to food, to housing, to security, and to a safe environment. These are not abstract principles. They are the lived experience of millions of people, especially in vulnerable countries like the Philippines.

Scientific research has shown that 50 major investor-owned carbon producers are responsible for 16% of the global temperature rise and 11% of sea level rise from 1880 to 2010. These are companies that have profited from fossil fuels while contributing significantly to the climate crisis that is endangering communities and undermining human rights across the globe.

In the Philippines, this connection between corporate responsibility, climate change, and human rights is at the center of a groundbreaking national inquiry. Survivors of Typhoon Haiyan—one of the most powerful storms ever recorded—together with Greenpeace, called on the country’s Commission on Human Rights to investigate whether these major carbon producers can be held accountable for climate-related human rights abuses.

The inquiry is examining how the actions of these fossil fuel companies have contributed to climate change and, in turn, how this has harmed people’s rights. It is an important step in recognizing that those who have contributed most to the climate crisis must not be allowed to evade responsibility for its human consequences.

The Commission on Human Rights has invited these companies to attend a meeting in Manila on December 11th. Their presence is urgently needed. By showing up, they have the opportunity to respond to the allegations, engage with affected communities, and acknowledge the growing demand for accountability in the era of climate change.

This effort in the Philippines is part of a wider global push for climate justice. Around the world, legal actions are increasingly being used to challenge governments and corporations over their role in the climate crisis and its impacts on people’s rights. These cases are helping to establish that climate change is not only an environmental issue—it is a profound justice and human rights issue.

Marking Human Rights Day this year means standing with communities who are demanding that their rights be protected from the escalating impacts of climate change. It means insisting that those who have benefited most from polluting the atmosphere take responsibility for the damage caused.

It also means pushing for real solutions. A rapid and just transition away from fossil fuels and towards 100% renewable energy is essential to protect human rights now and for future generations. This transition must be fair, equitable, and grounded in the needs and voices of those most affected.

Public support is crucial. People everywhere can stand with the survivors of Typhoon Haiyan and with all communities on the frontlines of the climate crisis by calling on major carbon producers to acknowledge their role, participate in processes like the Manila inquiry, and support a shift to clean, renewable energy.

On this Human Rights Day, the message is clear: defending human rights in the 21st century means demanding climate justice.
