The converging crises of climate catastrophes and the COVID-19 pandemic have laid bare long-standing structural inequalities. Those who have contributed least to global emissions and ecological destruction—women, Indigenous Peoples, and communities in the Global South—are often on the frontlines of impacts. These overlapping emergencies show that our current economic and political systems are not only failing to protect people and the planet, but are actively deepening injustice.

In sectors like agriculture and energy, the stakes could not be higher. Industrial food systems and fossil-fuelled power structures have driven environmental breakdown while concentrating wealth and decision-making in the hands of a few. The way forward must be rooted in human rights and environmental justice. This means subjecting these sectors to stringent regulation that is grounded in robust human rights and environmental impact assessments, and that requires the free, prior, and informed consent of women and Indigenous Peoples whose lands, livelihoods, and bodies are most directly affected.

At the same time, wealthy nations and corporations have continued to profit from overlapping crises. From speculative gains in food and energy markets to the expansion of extractive projects under the guise of “recovery,” the architecture of the global economy has enabled those with power and capital to turn disaster into opportunity. The result is a system that socializes risks and privatizes gains, while communities absorb the shocks of climate disasters, health emergencies, and economic instability.

These realities demand more than marginal reforms. They call for alternatives to capitalism that move us beyond an economic model obsessed with growth at any cost. Such alternatives recognize that wellbeing—not GDP—is the true measure of a thriving society. Diverse visions already exist that point in this direction, including frameworks like the Economy for the Common Good matrix, which evaluates economic activity according to values such as human dignity, solidarity, ecological sustainability, social justice, and democratic participation. By prioritizing these principles, societies can reorient their economies away from extraction and toward care, regeneration, and resilience.

Transformative change also requires shifting financial flows. Divesting from fossil fuels is non-negotiable in a world that must rapidly decarbonize to avoid the worst impacts of climate breakdown. The same is true for military systems that consume vast public resources, fuel conflict, and entrench authoritarian and extractive power structures. Redirecting these funds toward climate solutions, public health, education, and social protection is essential for building just and sustainable societies.

A just transition must also recognize and revalue care work. Care—whether paid or unpaid—is critical to sustaining life, communities, and ecosystems. Recognizing care work as green jobs acknowledges its central role in low-carbon, resilient societies and challenges the gendered hierarchies that have long relegated this work to the margins. Elevating care means ensuring fair wages, decent working conditions, and social protections, while centering the knowledge and leadership of those—predominantly women—who perform this work every day.

Underlying all of this is the urgent need to redistribute power away from corporations and toward people and communities. Voluntary commitments and corporate social responsibility have proven inadequate to address systemic abuses and environmental destruction. Binding accountability measures are needed, including a strong international treaty that holds corporations liable for human rights violations and environmental harms across their global operations and supply chains. Such a treaty would be a critical step toward ensuring that communities have access to justice, that corporate impunity is curtailed, and that economic activity is aligned with planetary boundaries and human rights.

The crises we face are interconnected, and so are the solutions. By regulating harmful sectors through a human rights and environmental lens, challenging the profiteering of wealthy nations and corporations, embracing economic models that prioritize wellbeing over GDP, divesting from destructive industries, valuing care as green work, and enforcing binding corporate accountability, it is possible to confront structural inequality at its roots. The path forward lies in centering those most affected, redistributing power, and building economies that serve people and the planet, not profit.
