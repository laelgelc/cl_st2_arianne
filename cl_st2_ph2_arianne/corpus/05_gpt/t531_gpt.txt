In Tanjung Taruna Village, Central Kalimantan, memories of the 2015 forest fires have never really faded. Nasrullah, chairperson of the Forest Fire Community there, remembers how that year’s catastrophe forced people to flee their homes as fires raged across the landscape. The smoke, the fear, and the disruption to daily life left a mark that still shapes how the community faces each new dry season.

Since then, every year as the rains recede and the land dries out, people in Tanjung Taruna brace themselves. The community has taken on the responsibility of watching for hotspots, preventing fires where they can, and working to extinguish them when they break out. Nasrullah and others in the village have become frontline guardians, doing what they can with limited resources to stop a repeat of 2015.

This year, however, the situation escalated again. Starting in July, fires spread and intensified to the point that a state of emergency was declared in six provinces. Despite the scale of the crisis, the government response has not matched the urgency on the ground. Measures like water bombing have proven insufficient to control the blazes or protect communities from their impacts.

Greenpeace Indonesia’s team has been working alongside local people, supporting efforts to tackle the fires and cope with the worsening conditions. Together, they have been trying to hold the line against the flames and the spreading haze. But as the weeks went by, the smoke thickened instead of clearing. Air quality plunged, with the Air Quality Index (AQI) surpassing 300—well into the “hazardous” range—and at times reaching 2000. The choking haze did not stop at Indonesia’s borders, affecting neighboring countries as well.

For people in Tanjung Taruna and across Central Kalimantan, this is not an abstract environmental issue; it is a recurring disaster that disrupts lives, harms health, and threatens their future. Nasrullah’s message is clear: this cannot be allowed to continue.

He is calling on the government to fully enforce existing laws against those responsible for setting or enabling these fires. Without real consequences for perpetrators, the cycle of burning and haze will go on. He also urges the adoption and implementation of strong peat protection policies. Peatlands, when drained and degraded, become highly flammable and are a major driver of these fires and their toxic smoke. Protecting peat is essential to preventing the kind of devastation his community has lived through again and again.

For Nasrullah and many others, the hope is simple but urgent: that with firm law enforcement and robust peat protection, these seasonal disasters can finally come to an end, and communities like Tanjung Taruna can face the dry season without fear.
