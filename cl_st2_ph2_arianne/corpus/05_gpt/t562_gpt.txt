Our ability to survive the climate crisis depends on how we use land. The way we grow food, manage forests, and treat natural ecosystems is directly linked to rising temperatures, collapsing biodiversity, and the stability of our climate.

Industrial agriculture is at the heart of this problem. Expanding large-scale monocultures and livestock production destroys forests and other natural habitats, driving countless species toward extinction. This model of farming replaces rich, diverse ecosystems with uniform fields, breaking the web of life that sustains pollinators, predators, and soil organisms. To protect biodiversity and climate together, the expansion of industrial agriculture must stop.

Instead of clearing more land, we need to restore natural areas and transform how we farm. Ecological farming offers a way forward. By working with nature rather than against it, ecological methods reduce dependence on synthetic chemicals and protect insects and other vital species. Healthier soils, diverse crops, and natural pest control can make farms more resilient while supporting the ecosystems around them.

Respecting the rights of Indigenous Peoples is central to this transformation. Indigenous territories are often strongholds of biodiversity, precisely because their custodians have protected and managed these lands for generations. Upholding their rights and knowledge is not only a matter of justice; it is a proven way to safeguard ecosystems that are critical for climate stability.

Soil itself is a powerful ally in the fight against climate change, but intensive farming is degrading this essential resource. Healthy soils store vast amounts of carbon, helping keep it out of the atmosphere. When soils are overworked, compacted, or stripped of organic matter, they lose this storage capacity and become more vulnerable to erosion and drought. Protecting and rebuilding soil health is therefore a climate priority.

Changing what we eat is just as important as changing how we farm. Shifting toward more plant-based diets and reducing meat consumption would make the global food system far more efficient. Less land would be needed to feed more people, freeing up space for nature to recover. This dietary shift would also bring health benefits while cutting emissions from both agriculture and deforestation.

Forests and grasslands are some of the most effective natural systems we have for capturing and storing carbon. Protecting these ecosystems and allowing them to regenerate is essential for keeping global heating within 1.5°C. Every hectare of forest or grassland saved from destruction is a step away from climate breakdown and a step toward a livable future.

Transforming land use is not optional; it is a core part of any credible plan to tackle the climate crisis. Halting destructive agricultural expansion, restoring ecosystems, supporting ecological farming, respecting Indigenous rights, caring for soils, and embracing more plant-based diets together form a pathway to protect biodiversity, stabilize the climate, and ensure that people and nature can thrive.
