Each year, Black Friday and Cyber Monday are promoted as unmissable opportunities to buy more for less. Behind the glossy ads and countdown timers, though, is a surge of overconsumption that drives massive waste and deepens the environmental crisis. Nowhere is this more visible than in fast fashion, where clothes are produced and discarded at a staggering pace.

Greenpeace is calling for a different path. Instead of another weekend of impulse buying, we support “Buy Nothing Day” as a way to pause and question the culture of constant consumption. Saying no to unnecessary purchases, even for a day, is a powerful statement against a system that treats the planet as disposable.

Fast fashion is at the heart of this problem. Clothing is being produced faster and cheaper than ever, and people are encouraged to treat garments as short-lived trends rather than long-lasting essentials. This has shortened the lifecycle of clothes dramatically. Items are often worn only a few times before being pushed aside for the next new thing.

The environmental cost is immense. The production of clothing pollutes water with toxins, harming ecosystems and communities downstream from factories. At the other end of the chain, the sheer volume of discarded clothing overwhelms second-hand markets. There are simply too many garments for resale to be a real solution, and recycling at this scale is not viable with current systems.

As a result, most garments ultimately become waste. They are burned or sent to landfills, releasing pollution and taking up space for years to come. What started as a “good deal” on a shopping weekend ends as another burden on the environment.

Greenpeace is calling for a “Time out for Fast Fashion” to break this destructive cycle. Instead of buying new, we can choose to wear, repair, swap, and reuse the clothes we already have for much longer. Extending the life of each garment is one of the most effective ways to reduce its environmental footprint.

But responsibility does not lie with individuals alone. Fashion brands must change how they operate. That means designing clothes for quality and longevity, not for rapid turnover. Garments should be made to last—physically and stylistically—so that people can keep and love them for years, rather than weeks.

By stepping back from Black Friday and Cyber Monday and embracing alternatives like Buy Nothing Day, we can send a clear message: the health of the planet matters more than a fleeting bargain. Choosing to slow down, to value what we already own, and to demand better from brands is a crucial step toward a fashion system that respects both people and the environment.
