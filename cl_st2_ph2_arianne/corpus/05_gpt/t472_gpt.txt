In 1961, the author’s father sat them down and explained something that sounded abstract at the time but now feels uncomfortably close: oil would not last forever. He described how oil fields follow a pattern. Production rises as new wells are drilled and technology improves, then eventually peaks as the easiest, cheapest oil is used up. After that, costs rise, output falls, and no amount of wishful thinking can change the basic reality of a finite resource.

More than sixty years later, that early warning is playing out. Global oil production outside a few major producers—specifically the United States, Russia, and Saudi Arabia—already peaked in 2017. Since then, output from much of the world has been in decline. Even within the remaining big producers, serious concerns are emerging. There are warnings that Russian and Saudi oil production could see sharp drops, pushing the global system closer to the kind of structural decline the author’s father anticipated.

Much of the apparent resilience of global supply has been tied to the US shale boom. On the surface, shale transformed the United States into a leading producer, seemingly overturning old worries about scarcity. But the blog post stresses that this boom is built on shaky foundations. Shale wells decline quickly, demanding constant drilling just to maintain production. The industry has been fueled by easy credit and mounting debt rather than durable profitability.

The post likens this pattern to a Ponzi scheme: new money is needed to pay for the last round of drilling, while genuine returns remain elusive. As reality catches up, waves of bankruptcies are rolling through the sector. Communities and workers are left exposed as companies fold, and the supposed miracle of endless shale growth looks more like a brief, expensive illusion.

The same story is unfolding in other extreme forms of oil extraction. Tar sands projects, once sold as a long-term answer to declining conventional oil, are struggling. High costs, technical challenges, and mounting environmental opposition are undermining their viability. Instead of becoming a stable pillar of supply, many of these projects are failing, adding to the sense that the fossil fuel industry is running out of road.

Investors are taking notice. Capital is starting to move away from oil and gas as doubts grow about long-term returns. The combination of depleting resources, rising costs, and unstable business models is making fossil fuel investments look increasingly risky. This financial shift is happening alongside intensifying climate impacts and rising public pressure, further eroding the industry’s social and economic license to operate.

Against this backdrop, the author returns to that conversation from 1961. The point was never just that oil would run out one day, but that clinging to a finite, polluting resource is a dangerous way to build an economy. Today, with production already peaking in many regions, warning signs from Russia and Saudi Arabia, a debt-fueled shale sector, failing tar sands projects, and investors heading for the exits, the need for change is unmistakable.

The post concludes with a clear call: use this moment of reckoning to accelerate the transition to renewable energy. Continuing to depend on an industry facing both physical limits and escalating climate risks is a gamble with our economies and our future. Shifting to renewables is not just an environmental imperative; it is a practical response to the hard realities of oil depletion and the fragility of the fossil fuel business model.
