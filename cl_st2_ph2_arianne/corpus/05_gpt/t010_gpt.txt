In 2016, artist Benjamin Von Wong created an image that would travel around the world: a mermaid trapped in a sea of 10,000 plastic bottles. The photograph, built from discarded plastic and shared widely online, reached an audience of around 35 million people. It helped spark conversations about our disposable culture, contributed to shifts in behaviour around single-use plastics, and fed into policy changes aimed at reducing plastic consumption.

Yet, even as public awareness and policies have evolved, plastic production has continued to grow. The underlying systems driving plastic use—fossil fuel extraction, petrochemical expansion, and the steady flow of new, virgin plastics—remain largely intact.

Last year, Von Wong built a four-storey-tall faucet installation at the United Nations to support the Global Plastics Treaty process. The towering tap was meant to show that the world needs to turn off the flow of plastic at its source. But the message was often misinterpreted, with some audiences seeing it more as a general symbol of plastic pollution rather than a call to address production itself.

In response, Von Wong has now partnered with Greenpeace to create a new artwork: a five-metre “perpetual plastic machine.” This installation visually traces the lifecycle of plastics back to their roots in fossil fuels, showing how oil and gas are transformed into plastic that then floods our lives and environment. By making the fossil fuel–plastic connection tangible, the artwork calls attention to the need to tackle production, not just waste.

The perpetual plastic machine is a direct call for a strong Global Plastics Treaty. Ahead of the second session of the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee (INC-2), it urges governments to support a robust agreement that includes a moratorium on virgin plastic production. The message is clear: to truly address the plastics crisis, the world must confront the fossil fuel system that feeds it and stop the expansion of new plastic at its source.
