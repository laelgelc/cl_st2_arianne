In 2016, artist Benjamin Von Wong created a haunting image that traveled around the world: a mermaid trapped in a sea of 10,000 plastic bottles. The piece was designed to confront people with the reality of disposable culture and our reliance on single-use plastics. The image resonated widely, reaching 35 million views, sparking conversations about the throwaway nature of everyday items, and contributing to policy discussions, behavior changes, and broader awareness about the scale of plastic pollution.

Yet, even with rising awareness and some progress, plastic production has continued to grow. The systems driving plastic use—rooted in fossil fuel extraction and an economic model built on endless growth and disposability—remain largely intact.

As governments began negotiating a Global Plastics Treaty, Von Wong turned his attention to this new battleground. He built a 4-story faucet installation at the United Nations to symbolize the need to turn off the tap on plastic production. However, the message behind the artwork was not fully understood. Instead of clearly conveying the urgency of cutting plastics at the source, the piece was misinterpreted, and its core message about upstream action did not land as intended.

Learning from that experience, Von Wong has now partnered with Greenpeace to create a new installation: a 5-meter “perpetual plastic machine.” This artwork visualizes the full fossil fuel–plastic lifecycle, showing how plastics are not just a waste problem but deeply connected to fossil fuel extraction and production. The machine is designed to make visible the continuous loop in which fossil fuels are turned into plastic, used briefly, and then persist in the environment, while production keeps accelerating.

This new piece is a call for a strong, ambitious Global Plastics Treaty—one that doesn’t just focus on recycling or waste management, but tackles plastic at its source. Central to that demand is a moratorium on virgin plastic production: a clear signal that the world must stop expanding the flow of new plastics into the system.

As governments prepare for the second session of the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee (INC-2), Von Wong’s perpetual plastic machine stands as a visual reminder of what is at stake. It urges decision-makers to confront the root causes of the plastics crisis and to commit to a treaty that can truly change the system, not just manage its fallout.
