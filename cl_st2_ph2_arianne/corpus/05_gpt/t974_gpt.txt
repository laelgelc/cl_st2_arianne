The Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) was created in 1993 to give consumers and companies confidence that wood and paper products come from responsibly managed forests. Its certification system is meant to ensure that logging respects Indigenous rights, protects key ecological values, and involves affected communities in decisions.

Greenpeace campaigner Grant Rosoman has highlighted a recent decision that puts these principles to the test: the suspension of three FSC certificates held by Canada’s Resolute Forest Products. The independent auditor Rainforest Alliance took this step after finding that Resolute failed to meet several core FSC requirements. These included obtaining the free and informed consent of First Nations, protecting High Conservation Values, and securing adequate support from stakeholders.

The suspensions follow formal complaints made by the Grand Council of the Crees, Greenpeace, and other groups. The complaints focused on logging operations in Quebec and Ontario’s boreal forests, raising concerns about violations in areas that include endangered regions such as the Montagnes Blanches and critical caribou habitats.

In total, the suspended certificates cover 8 million hectares of forest. While this is a serious measure, it also reinforces the credibility of the FSC system. By suspending certificates that do not meet its standards, FSC demonstrates that it is prepared to remove weak or non-compliant certificates and strengthen enforcement of its rules.
