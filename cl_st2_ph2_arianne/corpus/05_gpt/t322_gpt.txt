The ocean is under assault from all sides. Climate breakdown is heating and acidifying the seas, plastic pollution is choking marine life, overfishing is emptying waters of life, and now a new threat is looming on the horizon: deep sea mining.

Corporations are eyeing the darkest depths of the ocean floor for polymetallic nodules – small, rock-like deposits rich in metals used to make everyday electronics. These nodules form over millions of years and are scattered across vast areas of the seabed. To get to them, mining operations would strip away the top layers of the ocean floor, destroying everything in their path and sending plumes of sediment billowing through the water.

In these depths, life has evolved in extraordinary ways. On sponges that grow on polymetallic nodules, the Ghost Octopus lays its eggs and then dies protecting them. The entire reproductive cycle of this species depends on the presence of these nodules and the sponges that grow on them. Remove the nodules, and you remove the habitat this animal needs to survive.

Nearby, the armored Sea Pangolin lives in one of the harshest environments on Earth, relying on bacteria to sustain it. This unique relationship allows it to thrive where few other creatures can, but it also makes the species especially vulnerable to disturbance. Mining could obliterate the bacteria-rich habitats that keep it alive.

The Yeti Crab is another deep sea specialist, farming microbes on its hairy arms. These microbes are its food source, and the crab’s entire way of life is built around this strange, delicate farming system. Females die after breeding, making every generation crucial. Disrupting their habitat with heavy machinery and sediment clouds could push these animals beyond recovery.

These are just a few examples of the life that depends on deep sea ecosystems. Most species living there are still unknown to science. What we do know is that deep sea mining would cause irreversible damage. The slow-growing communities on the seabed cannot simply “bounce back” after being scraped away.

The impacts would not stop at biodiversity loss. The deep ocean plays a vital role in storing carbon and regulating the climate. Disturbing sediments and habitats on the seafloor risks releasing stored carbon and disrupting processes that help keep our climate stable. At a time when the climate crisis is already intensifying storms, heatwaves, and sea level rise, adding another source of disruption to the ocean’s carbon stores is the last thing we need.

Crucially, we do not need to tear up the deep sea to access the metals used in our phones, laptops, and other electronics. Alternatives already exist. A circular economy that designs products to last longer, be repaired, and be reused can drastically reduce demand for new raw materials. Proper e-waste recycling can recover valuable metals from discarded devices instead of letting them pile up in landfills or be burned. Greater resource efficiency – using fewer materials to deliver the same services – can further cut the pressure to exploit new frontiers like the deep sea.

Choosing these pathways means choosing to protect the ocean rather than sacrifice it for short-term profit. But to do that, governments must act. A strong Global Ocean Treaty is urgently needed to create ocean sanctuaries where marine life is safe from destructive industries like deep sea mining, industrial fishing, and other large-scale extractive activities. Such sanctuaries would give space for marine ecosystems to recover and help safeguard the ocean’s role in stabilising the climate.

People everywhere can help make this happen. By signing the petition calling for a strong Global Ocean Treaty, you are adding your voice to a growing movement demanding protection for the high seas. This is a pivotal moment: either we allow a new rush to exploit the last untouched ecosystems on Earth, or we choose to defend them and the life they support.

The deep sea is not a resource bank to be emptied. It is a living, interconnected world that sustains extraordinary creatures and helps keep our planet habitable. Protecting it means protecting our shared future.
