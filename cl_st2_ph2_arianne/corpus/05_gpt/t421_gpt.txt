Cabo Pulmo, on the coast of Baja California Sur in Mexico, is home to a coral reef that shelters an extraordinary variety of marine life: fish, crustaceans, mollusks, birds, and marine mammals, many of them at risk. Just 25 years ago, this richness was under serious threat from overfishing and irresponsible tourism that were degrading the ecosystem and putting species in danger.

Faced with this crisis, local communities decided to act. Their organizing and determination led to Cabo Pulmo being declared a National Marine Park in 1995. With protection and better management in place, the ocean began to recover. Fish populations increased by more than 400%, and the reef once again became a vital refuge and feeding ground for migratory species such as whale sharks, mantas, humpback whales, turtles, and various shark species.

This ecological recovery went hand in hand with a transformation in the local economy. Communities that had depended on fishing shifted toward ecotourism, building livelihoods around the conservation of the reef instead of its exploitation. Cabo Pulmo became an example of how protecting nature can support both biodiversity and local people.

But the story didn’t end there. In 2008, the large-scale tourism and real-estate project “Cabo Cortés,” promoted by the company Hansa Urbana, threatened to reverse these gains. The project risked bringing pollution and habitat destruction to the area, endangering the fragile balance that had been restored.

In response, local communities and allies launched campaigns to defend Cabo Pulmo, working with Greenpeace to raise national and international awareness. A petition gathering 220,000 signatures helped demonstrate massive public opposition to Cabo Cortés. In 2012, after years of pressure and mobilization, the project was cancelled.

The experience of Cabo Pulmo shows how people power can protect the oceans and secure long-term benefits for communities and nature. It is a concrete example of what can be achieved when marine areas are given strong protection and when local people are at the heart of decision-making.

Building on this success, there is an urgent call to extend similar protections across the world’s seas. Safeguarding at least 30% of the oceans through a network of marine sanctuaries, supported by a strong Global Ocean Treaty, is essential to give marine life the space it needs to recover and thrive. The story of Cabo Pulmo is a reminder that when people organize and stand together, it is possible to defend the blue heart of the planet.
