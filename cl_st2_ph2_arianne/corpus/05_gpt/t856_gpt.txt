Looking back at 2016, it’s impossible to ignore how tough the year was for people and the planet. Around the world we saw power grabs by politicians and corporations, the silencing and murder of activists, vast forest fires, coral reefs turning ghostly white, and ice melting at alarming rates. These weren’t isolated incidents; they were stark reminders of how urgently we need to change course.

But a new year offers a chance to recommit, refocus, and resolve to do better together. Building a sustainable world in 2017 isn’t about a single heroic act. It’s about millions of us choosing, day after day, to push in the same direction.

One way to start is by strengthening our skills in campaigning and mobilising others. Learning how to organise, tell powerful stories, and bring people together around a shared goal can turn concern into real-world change. When more of us know how to plan actions, reach out in our communities, and support each other, our collective power grows.

To stay effective, we also need to recharge personally. Burnout doesn’t help anyone—least of all the movements that rely on our energy and creativity. Making time to rest, reflect, and reconnect with what inspires us is not a luxury; it’s part of long-term resistance.

Our own daily choices matter too. Reducing personal impact can start with what’s on our plates: eating less meat is one concrete way to shrink our environmental footprint. We can cut waste by avoiding unnecessary plastics, especially single-use items, and by choosing to walk or cycle where possible instead of driving. Repairing things instead of throwing them away helps reduce demand for new resources and keeps usable items out of landfills.

Standing up for justice is at the heart of environmental protection. That means standing with Indigenous Peoples defending their lands and rights, with workers fighting for fair and safe conditions, and with communities resisting exploitation and abuse. Environmental harm and social injustice are deeply connected; confronting one means confronting the other.

Our voices are tools we must use. Contacting elected officials and companies to tell them what kind of future we expect—one that protects forests, respects human rights, and acts on climate—is a vital part of democracy. Demanding stronger forest protection and real climate accountability sends a clear message: we are watching, and we expect action.

Change also grows from the ground up. Volunteering with local groups and initiatives helps build resilience and solidarity where we live. Whether it’s joining a community clean-up, supporting a local campaign, or helping organise educational events, local action can ripple outward in powerful ways.

None of this has to be done alone. Bringing friends and family into actions—inviting them to a meeting, sharing petitions, or planning a joint project—multiplies our impact. Conversations at kitchen tables, in classrooms, and at workplaces can spark new commitments and new leaders.

The setbacks of 2016 were real and painful. But they also clarified what’s at stake and what we must protect. In 2017, every skill we sharpen, every habit we change, every stand we take with others brings us closer to the sustainable, just world we know is possible.
