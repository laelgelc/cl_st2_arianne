Every day, my work asks me to look closely at the kinds of images most people instinctively turn away from.

I’m a photo editor, which means I spend hours sifting through photographs of the world as it is: flooded homes, parched riverbeds, broken roads, families wading through waist‑deep water carrying what little they can save. Increasingly, those images are of disasters made worse by climate change. And increasingly, I feel the weight of them.

Recently, that weight has grown heavier. Frame after frame, the same story repeats itself in different corners of the world: people who did almost nothing to cause this crisis are among the first to lose their homes, their livelihoods, and sometimes their lives.

The floods in Pakistan were a turning point in how I experience this work. Seeing a third of a country submerged is one thing to read as a statistic; it’s another to see it, again and again, through the eyes of dozens of photographers. Fields turned into endless lakes. Roads vanishing beneath brown water. Entire villages cut off. Millions of people displaced, in a country whose contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions is tiny compared with that of richer, industrialized nations. 

The injustice is right there in the pixels: a child standing in murky water where her house used to be, a farmer staring at crops that will never be harvested. Pakistan’s low emissions don’t protect its people from the consequences of a warming planet, and that disconnect is part of what makes these images so hard to process emotionally. You see the faces of those paying the price for a crisis they did not create.

Then there are the photos from Bangalore, India, where unprecedented rains turned a major tech hub into a maze of flooded streets. The water damage is one layer of the story; another is the way poor urban planning left entire neighborhoods exposed. Cars half‑submerged, office parks cut off, workers stranded. The images carry not only the chaos of extreme weather but the quiet, preventable failures of planning and regulation. It’s painful to look at because you can see how much of the damage could have been avoided.

From West and Central Africa, the pattern repeats—only the faces and landscapes change. Flooding there has displaced more than 125,000 people. In Nigeria alone, at least 300 people have died. As I go through the images, I see families sheltering in schools turned into temporary camps, people moving through flooded streets in improvised boats, and homes reduced to waterlogged shells. The sense of loss is visible in every frame, but so is a kind of weary resilience. People keep going because they have no other choice. 

In Europe, the crisis looks different, but it’s still a crisis. This year brought the continent’s worst drought in decades. Photographs of dried‑up riverbeds show boats sitting on cracked earth where water should be. Historic rivers reduced to trickles, exposing old bridges, rocks, even long‑submerged relics. The lush landscapes many people associate with Europe are replaced by dusty fields and shriveled crops. Editing these images, I’m struck by how they shatter the illusion that wealthy regions are somehow insulated from climate impacts.

Chile tells yet another version of the same story. The country is in a prolonged drought that has dragged on for years, and the images show reservoirs turned into barren basins and communities lining up for water deliveries. What makes this especially painful to look at is knowing that water privatization has made the crisis even worse, with half the population affected. The photographs capture the everyday reality of living without reliable access to water: people filling containers from trucks, dusty yards where gardens used to be, and a constant sense of uncertainty about something as basic as turning on a tap.

At the same time, I’m sorting through images of storms on the other side of the world: typhoons and hurricanes tearing through parts of Asia, Puerto Rico, and Canada. Roofs ripped off houses, power lines down, whole neighborhoods in the dark. Satellite images show swirling storm systems; on the ground, photographers capture people picking through debris, trying to salvage what they can from homes battered by wind and rain. The scale is overwhelming, but each image is intimate: a person, a family, a community in the aftermath.

Looking at all of this day after day takes a mental toll that’s hard to describe. There’s a particular kind of exhaustion that comes from witnessing so much destruction secondhand, knowing it’s part of a global pattern and not a string of unrelated accidents. The line between professional distance and personal despair can get very thin.

What makes it worse is the knowledge that, even as these disasters unfold, fossil fuel companies continue to post massive profits. I don’t see those profits in the images I edit; I see their consequences. The frustration is hard to shake. You move from one disaster to the next—Pakistan, India, West and Central Africa, Europe, Chile, Puerto Rico, Canada—and in the background is the same, stubborn dependence on coal, oil, and gas that keeps driving the crisis.

And yet, amid all this, there is another set of images that I hold onto. They come from youth marches and climate protests around the world. Streets filled with young people carrying handmade signs, chanting, refusing to accept that this is the only possible future. Their faces are determined, sometimes angry, sometimes joyful. They march not because they are unaffected, but because they are among those who will live longest with the consequences of today’s choices.

When I’m overwhelmed by the photographs of flooded homes and empty rivers, I turn back to those images of youth in the streets. They are a reminder that the story isn’t only about loss and damage; it’s also about resistance and possibility. The same world that is producing these disasters is also producing a generation that refuses to let fossil fuel interests dictate their future.

Editing climate disaster imagery means living with a constant awareness of what is at stake. It means carrying the faces of people from Pakistan, India, West and Central Africa, Europe, Chile, Puerto Rico, Canada, and beyond in your mind long after you’ve closed your laptop. It also means recognizing that every march, every call to end our dependence on fossil fuels, is not abstract. It’s about those very people, those very places.

The images of youth marching give me a kind of cautious hope: not a belief that everything will be fine, but a belief that people are fighting for something better. In a world where a third of a country can be submerged, where rivers run dry and storms rip apart communities, that hope is not a luxury. It’s a necessity.
