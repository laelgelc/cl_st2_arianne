The Greenpeace ship Arctic Sunrise is sailing across the Indian Ocean this month to document and expose the threats facing these waters. This vast region is home to an incredible diversity of wildlife and ecosystems, from pygmy blue whales and dugongs to colorful coral reefs and the world’s largest seagrass meadow.

These oceans are not only rich in life; they are also a lifeline. Millions of people living along coasts and on islands across the region depend on the sea for food and their livelihoods. Healthy oceans mean full nets, secure incomes, and communities that can withstand shocks and change.

But marine life here is under severe pressure. Industrial fishing is stripping the seas of life at a dangerous pace, and climate breakdown is compounding the damage, disrupting ecosystems and pushing species and habitats closer to collapse. The very foundations of life in the Indian Ocean are being eroded.

This is why the Arctic Sunrise is in the Indian Ocean: to bear witness, gather evidence, and share what is happening beneath the waves with the world. The stories and images from this journey will help show what is at stake and why urgent action is needed.

Governments around the world must step up to protect the oceans and the people who depend on them. This means putting the health of marine ecosystems ahead of short-term industrial interests and committing to real, lasting protection.

You can be part of this journey. Follow the Arctic Sunrise in the Indian Ocean, share its stories, and add your voice to the call for strong ocean protection.
