In 2016, Greenpeace joined forces with Norwegian youth group Natur og Ungdom to challenge the Norwegian government’s decision to open new areas of the Arctic for oil drilling. The case was built on a simple but powerful argument: granting new oil licenses in the fragile Arctic violates the constitutional right to a healthy environment, especially for future generations.

This right is enshrined in Article 112 of Norway’s Constitution, which states that everyone has the right to an environment that secures health and to a nature whose productivity and diversity are maintained. It also says that natural resources must be managed on the basis of long-term considerations that safeguard these rights for future generations. Greenpeace and Natur og Ungdom argued that by issuing new Arctic drilling licenses, the government was putting short-term oil profits ahead of these constitutional protections.

The court case unfolded over three years, becoming a landmark in Norway’s legal and political landscape. While the Court of Appeal ultimately ruled against Greenpeace and Natur og Ungdom, the judgment contained two crucial wins that will resonate far beyond this single case.

First, the court confirmed that Norway is responsible for the climate emissions that result from the oil and gas it exports and that is burned abroad. This recognition directly challenges the idea that a country’s climate responsibility ends at its borders. For a major oil exporter like Norway, this is a significant step: it links national decisions on fossil fuel production to their global climate impact.

Second, the court confirmed that Article 112 does provide real, substantive protection for people and nature. It is not just symbolic language, but a legal standard that the government must respect. This means that decisions about resource extraction and environmental risk can, in principle, be tested against the Constitution and challenged in court.

Despite these important findings, the Court of Appeal concluded that the specific Arctic oil licenses at issue did not conflict with Article 112. In other words, while the right to a healthy environment is real, the court decided that these particular drilling licenses did not cross the constitutional line. Greenpeace and Natur og Ungdom fundamentally disagreed with this conclusion and have appealed the case to the Norwegian Supreme Court.

This legal battle has thrown a spotlight on a deep tension at the heart of Norwegian society. Internationally, Norway is often seen as a climate leader, promoting green policies and sustainable development. At the same time, its economy has long depended on oil and gas, and new Arctic drilling represents a continued bet on fossil fuels in a time of accelerating climate crisis. The case forces a hard question: can a country credibly present itself as a climate champion while expanding oil production in one of the world’s most vulnerable regions?

The lawsuit is part of a broader global wave of climate litigation, where citizens, communities, and organisations are turning to the courts to hold governments and corporations accountable for their role in the climate crisis. Around the world, people are using legal tools to demand that decision-makers respect environmental rights, phase out fossil fuels, and protect those most affected by climate change.

At the same time, climate activism is growing, especially among young people. Natur og Ungdom’s role in this case reflects a wider movement of youth who are unwilling to accept decisions that lock in climate damage for decades to come. By standing up in court and in public, they are insisting that the rights of future generations must be taken seriously today.

The three-year court case between Greenpeace, Natur og Ungdom, and the Norwegian state is far from just a legal technicality. It is a test of whether constitutional environmental rights have real force when they come up against powerful fossil fuel interests. It is also a mirror held up to Norway, reflecting the gap between its green self-image and the reality of continued oil expansion.

As the case moves to the Supreme Court, its implications will extend well beyond Norway’s borders. The outcome will help shape how constitutional rights to a healthy environment are understood and enforced, and it will add to the growing body of climate litigation that is redefining what governments can—and must—do in the face of the climate emergency.
