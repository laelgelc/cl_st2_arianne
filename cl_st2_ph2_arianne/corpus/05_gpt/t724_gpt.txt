Dr. Nate Hagens’ “Reality 101” course at the University of Minnesota starts from a place many people know intuitively: the sense that something is deeply off in how our societies operate. Economic decline, widening inequality, pollution, biodiversity loss, and war are not isolated problems. They are interconnected symptoms of how we use energy and resources, how our economies are structured, and how our brains respond to short‑term rewards over long‑term wellbeing.

Instead of treating each issue in isolation, Hagens draws from systems ecology, neuroscience, and economics to show how these crises are part of a broader human predicament. This framing can feel overwhelming, and it naturally leads to the question: “What can I do?”

The response offered is that effective action is rarely linear or purely individual. It is about aligning personal choices, community efforts, and structural change with a set of guiding principles, rather than looking for a single solution or silver bullet.

A central theme is the importance of building and strengthening community cohesion. In a world facing ecological and economic stress, relationships and mutual support become critical forms of resilience. That can mean investing time and care in local networks, neighbourhood groups, and shared projects that help people rely less on distant, fragile systems.

Preserving ecosystems is another priority. Healthy forests, soils, waters, and biodiversity underpin everything else. Protecting and restoring them is not just a moral duty toward the natural world, but a practical necessity for any livable future.

The text also highlights the value of promoting local energy and food systems. Shorter, more local supply chains for essentials like food and power can reduce vulnerability to global shocks, lower environmental impacts, and reconnect people with the sources of their sustenance. This can involve supporting local producers, community energy projects, and practices that reduce dependence on high‑energy, high‑throughput systems.

Crucially, Hagens emphasizes accepting complexity. Our predicament does not lend itself to simple narratives or easy optimism. Learning to live with nuance and uncertainty, while still acting, is part of maturing our collective response. Alongside this is the call to “love nature” in a direct, experiential way—seeing the more‑than‑human world not just as a resource, but as something intrinsically worthy of care and attention.

The idea of “sharpen the sword” speaks to self‑improvement as a form of service. This can mean deepening knowledge, emotional resilience, and practical skills so that individual efforts become more effective over time. It is less about self‑help in isolation and more about becoming a steadier, more capable contributor to the common good.

Within this framework, a clear hierarchy of priorities is laid out. Reducing consumption comes first: using less energy and fewer materials overall is essential in a finite world. Stabilizing population is another key goal, recognizing that the total human demand on ecosystems is a function of both how many of us there are and how much we each consume. Cutting energy demand—especially in high‑consuming societies—follows naturally from this, as does ending militarism, which devours vast resources and locks societies into cycles of violence and fear.

The actions suggested to support these priorities are varied and interconnected. Campaigns can push for policy change and help shift public narratives. Local initiatives can demonstrate alternative ways of living and organizing that are more aligned with ecological limits and human wellbeing. Education—formal and informal—helps people understand the roots of our predicament and the options available, while resource sharing can reduce waste and strengthen solidarity.

Finally, the text points to book recommendations as a way to go deeper. Reading and study are presented not as escapes from action, but as tools to better understand the systems we are part of, and to act with more clarity and humility.

Taken together, this approach to “What can I do?” invites people to see themselves as part of a larger, complex system—one that is in trouble, but still full of possibilities for meaningful, grounded, and cooperative change.
