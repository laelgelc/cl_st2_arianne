From the first ideas about invisible building blocks of matter to today’s satellite measurements of a heating planet, the story of climate science stretches across millennia—and it has been remarkably consistent in one respect: the physics has worked; the warnings have been clear.

Ancient thinkers like Democritus speculated that everything was made of tiny, indivisible particles. These early atomic theories didn’t describe climate, but they laid a foundation for understanding matter, energy, and the interactions that underpin modern climate science. Centuries later, scientists began to apply this growing knowledge of physics to the air around us.

In the 19th century, researchers started to unravel how Earth’s atmosphere keeps the planet warm. Joseph Fourier recognized that the atmosphere acts like a blanket, trapping heat and making Earth habitable. Building on this, Eunice Foote, a pioneering woman scientist whose work was long overlooked, demonstrated that carbon dioxide can trap heat—an early experimental clue to what we now call the greenhouse effect. John Tyndall further explored how different gases absorb heat, identifying key components of the atmosphere that control how much energy Earth retains.

By the late 19th century, Svante Arrhenius connected these insights directly to fossil fuels. He calculated that burning coal and other fossil fuels would increase carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and raise global temperatures. His work showed that human activity could, in principle, alter the climate on a planetary scale. Later, Mikhail Budyko deepened this understanding, examining how feedbacks in the climate system—such as changes in ice and reflectivity—could amplify warming.

This scientific trajectory was not confined to academic circles. By the mid-20th century, the fossil fuel industry itself was studying the implications of its products. In the 1960s, the American Petroleum Institute received reports warning that emissions from fossil fuels would cause global heating. Around the same time, Exxon’s own scientists produced internal projections that rising carbon dioxide from continued fossil fuel use would drive measurable temperature increases. These forecasts of CO2 rise and associated warming were not vague guesses; they were quantitatively accurate enough that, in hindsight, they closely match what has actually happened.

From 1972 onward, governments began gathering at international conferences to discuss the environment and, increasingly, the climate crisis. Decade after decade, diplomats, experts, and leaders met under growing stacks of reports and evidence. The scientific picture sharpened: more precise measurements, better models, clearer attribution of warming to human emissions. Yet over this same period—despite the accuracy of early forecasts, despite the mounting consensus—global greenhouse gas emissions did not fall. They doubled.

This failure cannot be laid at the feet of science. The core warnings about fossil fuel combustion and global heating have been in place for generations. Instead, the reasons lie elsewhere: the deliberate deceit and obstruction by parts of the fossil fuel industry; governments that failed to act at the speed and scale required; media institutions that too often treated established science as a “debate” or avoided confrontation with powerful interests; and societies encouraged to equate well-being with ever-rising consumption.

Oil has also been deeply entangled with military power, shaping geopolitical strategies and conflicts. This has reinforced dependence on fossil fuels and made rapid change more politically fraught, even as the climate risks became undeniable. At the same time, many of the people who helped build our understanding—especially women scientists like Eunice Foote—were sidelined or forgotten, their contributions minimized in official histories.

The arc of climate science, from Democritus’s atoms to Budyko’s feedbacks and beyond, is not a story of ignorance. It is a record of steady, often brilliant progress in understanding how our planet works. The tragedy is that this understanding has not been matched by action. The physics was right. The forecasts were right. The question that remains is whether society will finally listen—not because the science has changed, but because we choose to.
