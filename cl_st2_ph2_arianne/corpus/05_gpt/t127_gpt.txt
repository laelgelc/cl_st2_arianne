The recent auction of 27 oil and three gas blocks in the Democratic Republic of Congo has been presented by the government as an act of nationalism, a bold move to boost the economy and put people’s needs above the protection of wildlife. These blocks overlap with some of the country’s most sensitive and valuable ecosystems, including vast peatlands and Virunga National Park.

Framing this decision as a patriotic choice implies that exploiting these fossil fuel reserves is the best or only way to deliver development, jobs and revenue. Yet many critics contest that narrative. They argue that rather than serving the Congolese people, the auction risks enriching a narrow elite while exposing communities and nature to serious harm.

The blocks on offer cut across areas where people live, farm, fish and depend on forests and rivers for their livelihoods. Exploitation of these oil and gas fields could lead to displacement, pollution of land and water, and the disruption of traditional ways of life. Critics highlight that affected communities have not been genuinely consulted, even though they stand to bear the greatest costs.

There is also concern that this model of development deepens, rather than breaks, patterns of neo-colonialism. Foreign powers seeking alternatives to Russian fuel are among those interested in Congo’s reserves. Critics warn that this dynamic risks locking the country into an extractive role: exporting raw resources while importing manufactured goods and shouldering the environmental and social damage.

In this view, calling the auction “nationalist” masks a reality in which external interests and domestic elites benefit most, while ordinary people and ecosystems lose. It raises deeper questions about who development is really for, and who gets to decide.

Those questioning the auction argue that genuine nationalism would mean reimagining development itself. Instead of doubling down on fossil fuels in fragile landscapes, they point to pathways based on local manufacturing, solar energy, nature conservation and eco-tourism.

Local manufacturing could keep more value within the country, creating jobs and skills rather than exporting unprocessed resources. Solar energy offers a way to expand access to power without the long-term climate and pollution impacts of oil and gas. Protecting peatlands, Virunga National Park and other ecosystems safeguards biodiversity and the services nature provides, while eco-tourism can generate income linked to conservation rather than destruction.

Such an approach is tied to demands for good governance and more equitable distribution of wealth. Critics argue that development should not be measured only in export volumes or foreign investment, but in how fairly benefits are shared and how well people’s rights and environments are protected.

The auction of oil and gas blocks in the DRC therefore sits at the heart of a broader debate. It forces a reckoning with the current socio-economic model that has long shaped African economies: one centred on extracting raw materials for others’ benefit. Whether this model can truly deliver prosperity, justice and long-term stability is increasingly being questioned, and alternative visions are being put forward that aim to align national pride with environmental protection and community well-being.
