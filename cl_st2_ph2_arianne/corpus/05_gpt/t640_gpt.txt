The mud came without warning.

In Brumadinho, Brazil, a mining dam burst and unleashed a torrent of sludge that swallowed everything in its path – homes, roads, people, animals, entire lives. At least 60 people are confirmed dead and more than 290 are still missing. Families wait in anguish for news, clinging to the smallest hope as rescue teams dig through the thick, toxic mud.

In the days since the collapse, Brumadinho has become a landscape of grief. Survivors tell of loved ones swept away in seconds, of frantic phone calls that were never answered, of entire families who did not make it out. People who managed to escape now live with the trauma of what they saw, and the unbearable uncertainty of not knowing whether those missing are alive or dead.

Evacuations have emptied neighbourhoods as fear spreads of a second dam failure. Sirens and warnings have driven people from their homes, forcing them to leave behind what little they have left. Many do not know when – or if – they will be able to return. The threat is constant, and the community lives on edge, listening for every sound that might signal more disaster.

This tragedy is not an isolated accident. It is tied to mining operations and the greed that has driven them, ignoring warnings and repeating patterns already seen in past dam collapses in Brazil. People in Brumadinho and beyond are asking how many times communities must pay the price while companies profit.

The environmental damage is only beginning to unfold. The sludge has already spread far from the dam, with projections that it could travel up to 220 km. Along its path, dead fish float in contaminated waters. The Paraopeba River, a vital source of life for communities along its banks, is now threatened by pollution. Indigenous lands are also at risk, their territories and ways of life endangered by the advancing wave of tailings.

For the people who depend on the river for water, food, and culture, this is not an abstract environmental issue – it is a direct assault on their survival and identity. The toxic mud does not just smother landscapes; it erodes rights, livelihoods, and futures.

Greenpeace activists are on the ground in Brumadinho and along the affected areas, documenting the scale of the tragedy and making sure the stories of victims and survivors are heard. They are listening to families, to workers, to Indigenous peoples, and sharing their testimonies so the world cannot look away.

This work is about more than bearing witness. It is about demanding justice. Communities are calling for full investigations into how this could happen again, and who is responsible. They want accountability from the mining company and the authorities who failed to prevent this disaster. They are calling for reparations that go beyond money – measures that restore dignity, clean up the environment, and protect people from future harm.

The collapse of the dam in Brumadinho is a human tragedy and an environmental crime. It is a stark reminder of the deadly consequences when profit is placed above people and nature. Greenpeace stands with the affected communities, supporting their demands for truth, justice, and real change so that no one else has to live through this nightmare again.
