Eight million people standing together convinced Shell to walk away from its plans to drill for oil in the Arctic. That victory showed that when we act collectively, we can protect one of the most fragile places on Earth from some of the most powerful companies in the world.

Now the Arctic needs that same collective power again.

Climate change is rapidly transforming the Arctic, stripping away the ice that has long acted as a shield. As the ice retreats, this ocean—already the least-protected on the planet—is becoming increasingly exposed to threats from oil exploitation and industrial fishing. Instead of seeing a warning, some see an opportunity to push further into these vulnerable waters.

There is a concrete opportunity, right now, to change that.

A proposal is on the table to protect 226,150 km² of international Arctic waters—10% of the entire Arctic—through the OSPAR commission. OSPAR has the authority to create protection for these high seas areas, and doing so would be a major step toward safeguarding the Arctic from destructive activity.

Time is very short. In just 18 days, governments will meet in Tenerife, Spain, with discussions starting on June 20. This is when a decision could be taken on protecting this vast Arctic area.

But Denmark, Norway, and Iceland are currently blocking the process, even though OSPAR is empowered to act. Their resistance is standing in the way of urgently needed protection.

That is why voices from around the world are so important right now. The Arctic is not a distant, isolated place; what happens there affects us all. Its ice, its waters, and its wildlife play a crucial role in the health and stability of the global climate and oceans.

People power has already pushed back Arctic oil once. Eight million of us made Shell walk away. We can use that same strength to demand that governments uphold their responsibility and protect this critical part of our shared planet.

Add your voice. Call on governments at OSPAR to protect 226,150 km² of Arctic international waters. Share why the Arctic matters to you—its role in the climate, its unique wildlife, its importance for future generations. Every reason, every message, and every person who speaks up helps build the pressure needed for change.

In the coming days, as governments prepare to gather in Tenerife, the world has a chance to choose protection over exploitation. Let’s make sure they hear, loud and clear, that the Arctic must be safeguarded—now and for the future.
