In 2016, I traveled deep into Ecuador’s Amazon and saw firsthand what oil contamination looks like when a corporation walks away from its responsibilities. Indigenous and farmer communities were living with poisoned water, toxic soil, and a legacy of disease linked to Chevron’s oil waste. People described cancer and birth defects that had become devastatingly common. Scientific sampling showed contamination levels far above legal standards, yet the waste pits and polluted streams remained part of daily life.

Local communities had not stayed silent. After years of organizing, documenting damage, and fighting in court, they won a landmark $9.5 billion judgment against Chevron in Ecuadorian courts. That decision was not a one-off: it was upheld on multiple appeals within Ecuador’s judicial system. On paper, it was a major environmental and human rights victory, recognizing the scale of harm and the need for cleanup and compensation.

Chevron’s response was not to pay. Instead, the company refused to honor the judgment and went on the offensive, targeting the people and lawyers who had helped the communities seek justice. At the center of this backlash was Steven Donziger, one of the lawyers who had worked with the affected communities.

In the United States, Chevron brought a civil RICO (racketeering) case against Donziger, overseen by Judge Lewis Kaplan. In that case, Kaplan accepted testimony from a key Chevron witness who had been paid by the company and whose account was later shown to be false. Kaplan also barred evidence of the underlying oil pollution from being presented, effectively separating the question of corporate misconduct from the reality of contamination on the ground.

The retaliation did not stop in the civil courtroom. When Donziger resisted certain court orders he believed were unlawful, Kaplan pursued him for contempt. This ultimately led to Donziger being placed under home detention, a highly unusual outcome for a lawyer who had helped secure a judgment on behalf of communities harmed by pollution.

What I saw in Ecuador and what unfolded in the courts afterward are part of the same story: communities living with severe oil contamination, a legal victory that recognized that harm, and then a powerful corporation using its vast resources to avoid accountability and punish those who challenged it. The treatment of Steven Donziger stands as a stark example of how environmental advocates can be targeted and intimidated when they help frontline communities confront corporate abuse.
