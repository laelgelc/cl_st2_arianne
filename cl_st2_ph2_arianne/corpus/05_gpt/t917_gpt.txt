In April 2014, the Republic of the Marshall Islands took an unprecedented step: it filed lawsuits at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) against nine nuclear-armed nations. These cases are rooted in the lived experience of a small Pacific nation that has endured some of the worst impacts of nuclear weapons testing.

Between 1946 and 1958, the United States conducted nuclear tests in the Marshall Islands. These tests contaminated the islands and exposed communities to severe radiation. The consequences have been long-lasting, affecting health, livelihoods, and the environment. In 1954, one of the most powerful tests produced radioactive fallout that drifted over inhabited atolls. Marshallese leader Tony de Brum later described how children, seeing the white particles falling from the sky, thought it was snow. They played in it and even ate it, unaware that it was radioactive fallout.

The human cost of these tests has shaped the Marshall Islands’ determination to challenge the nuclear-armed states. In 1985, Greenpeace’s ship Rainbow Warrior helped relocate residents from Rongelap Atoll, one of the communities affected by the fallout. This relocation was a response to the ongoing radiation risks that people faced in their own homes and on their ancestral lands.

Decades later, the Marshall Islands is seeking to hold nuclear-armed nations to their legal obligations. The lawsuits filed at the ICJ allege that these states have breached international law by failing to pursue negotiations in good faith towards nuclear disarmament. In March 2016, the ICJ heard preliminary oral arguments in the cases brought by the Marshall Islands against the United Kingdom, India, and Pakistan. These hearings focused on whether the Court has jurisdiction and whether the cases are admissible.

A decision on these preliminary issues is expected within six months of the March 2016 hearings. The outcome will determine whether the ICJ proceeds to consider the substance of the Marshall Islands’ claims. Throughout this process, Greenpeace supports the Marshall Islands’ effort to push nuclear-armed states towards fulfilling their disarmament obligations and to seek justice for the harms caused by nuclear testing.
