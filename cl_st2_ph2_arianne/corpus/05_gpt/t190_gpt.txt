Antarctica recently experienced temperatures around 40°C above normal, while regions near the North Pole were about 30°C warmer than usual. These are not minor anomalies; they are stark signals of a rapidly warming planet. At the same time, communities around the world are living through intensifying heatwaves, wildfires, and floods. What once might have been described as “extreme” is increasingly becoming part of a dangerous new normal, with real consequences for people’s safety, livelihoods, and homes.

Against this backdrop, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is preparing to release the third part of its current assessment: the Working Group III report on mitigation, due on 4 April. This report focuses on what the world is doing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and what still needs to be done to keep the goals of the Paris Agreement within reach. It will examine progress so far, identify emission reduction pathways still compatible with limiting warming in line with Paris, and look closely at how our patterns of consumption and broader social factors drive emissions.

The report will also explore options across key sectors of the global economy, including energy, agriculture, transport, and industry. These are the systems that must transform if we are to move away from a fossil-fuelled model of development and towards one that protects people and the climate. From how we produce and use energy, to how we grow food, move around, and manufacture goods, the choices made in these sectors will determine whether we can curb emissions fast enough.

As the world looks ahead to COP27 and the IPCC’s Synthesis Report expected in October 2022, the message from science is clear: a rapid transition away from fossil fuels is essential. The record-breaking temperatures at the poles and the escalating climate impacts felt by communities worldwide underscore the urgency. Science-based action, grounded in the best available evidence on mitigation pathways and sectoral solutions, must guide decisions in the months and years to come.
