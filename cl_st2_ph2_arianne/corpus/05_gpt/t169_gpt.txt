Cho Sun-Hee has spent years behind the camera capturing some of Korea’s most recognizable faces. Recently, she brought that experience into a new kind of collaboration: a W magazine photoshoot with Greenpeace Korea designed to spotlight the environmental crises shaping our lives.

For Cho, this project was about more than beautiful images. Working with celebrities, she wanted to use their influence to draw attention to urgent issues like single-use plastics and the growing impacts of climate change—heatwaves, powerful typhoons, and seasons that no longer feel like they used to. By placing these themes at the center of a high-profile fashion shoot, she aimed to reach people who might not otherwise engage deeply with environmental topics.

A key focus for her was limiting disposables. She highlighted how everyday reliance on single-use items has become routine, and how important it is to question and reduce that dependence. But she is clear that responsibility cannot rest on individuals alone. She stresses the need for strong action from governments and corporations, alongside public education that helps people understand both the scale of the problem and the power of collective solutions.

Cho believes schools have a particularly important role. By integrating environmental issues into education, children and young people can be inspired to care, act, and influence those around them. That educational foundation, in her view, is essential for motivating individual efforts that add up to broader change.

In the photoshoot itself, Cho drew on digital editing to create striking visual narratives about the climate crisis and the world we want instead. She explored themes such as rising sea levels and the promise of renewable energy, using visual storytelling to make abstract concepts feel immediate and real. Through this approach, the images connect environmental challenges with solutions in a way that is accessible and emotionally resonant.

The collaboration also shifted something in Cho personally. Working so closely on climate and plastic issues deepened her own commitment to living more sustainably. Her son has been a significant influence in that journey, encouraging her to think more about the future and the planet he will inherit. That family connection reinforced her sense of responsibility and urgency.

One of the aspects that left the biggest impression on her was the sincerity of the celebrities who took part. Far from treating the shoot as just another assignment, they engaged meaningfully with the themes and message behind the project. Their willingness to use their public platforms to talk about the environment underscored for Cho how powerful cultural figures can be in shifting attitudes and inspiring action.

Through this collaboration with Greenpeace Korea and W magazine, Cho Sun-Hee has shown how photography, celebrity influence, and thoughtful storytelling can come together to raise awareness about single-use plastics, climate change, and the choices we face today.
