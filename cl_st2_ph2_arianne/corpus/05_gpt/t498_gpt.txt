When a family of turtles sets out across the ocean, we should be imagining a journey full of life and colour – not a desperate struggle for survival. Yet that’s exactly what Greenpeace UK’s new short film, “Turtle Journey,” brings painfully to life.

Created in collaboration with the legendary Aardman Animations, and voiced by actors including Olivia Colman and Helen Mirren, the film follows a turtle family trying to make their way through an ocean that’s been pushed to breaking point. Everywhere they turn, human impacts close in: vast nets from industrial overfishing, the looming threat of oil drilling, plastic pollution clogging the water, and the mounting chaos of climate breakdown.

These are not distant or abstract threats. Sea turtles are already under pressure from all sides, and the wider marine world is in serious trouble. Species in the ocean are disappearing even faster than those on land. The places that should be safe havens – feeding grounds, nesting beaches, migration routes – are being eroded by our addiction to fossil fuels, destructive fishing, and a throwaway culture that litters the seas with plastic.

But the film doesn’t just show what we stand to lose; it reminds us what we still have the power to protect.

Oceans are one of our greatest allies in confronting the climate crisis. They absorb huge amounts of the emissions we pump into the atmosphere, helping to slow global heating. Healthy oceans, rich with life, are vital to stabilising the climate and supporting communities and wildlife around the world. When we damage them, we’re not only endangering turtles and other marine species – we’re undermining one of the planet’s most important defences against climate breakdown.

That’s why “Turtle Journey” calls for something very specific: proper, global protection for our shared seas. Greenpeace and allies are urging governments to agree a strong Global Ocean Treaty at the United Nations. Such a treaty would allow the creation of ocean sanctuaries – fully protected areas, off-limits to the most harmful human activities – across at least a third of the world’s oceans.

Protecting at least a third of global oceans in this way would give marine life the space it needs to recover and thrive. For turtles, that means safer migration routes and healthier feeding grounds. For countless other species, it means a fighting chance at survival. And for the climate, it means restoring the oceans’ ability to absorb emissions and buffer us from the worst impacts of a heating world.

The film ends with a clear message: this is a journey we are all part of. Governments will only act at the scale needed if people everywhere demand it. Viewers are urged to sign a petition calling on world leaders to back a strong Global Ocean Treaty and to share the video so that many more people see what’s at stake.

“Turtle Journey” is a powerful reminder that our choices on land are reshaping life in the sea – and that we still have time to turn the tide. By raising our voices, pushing our governments, and standing up for global ocean protection, we can help ensure that turtle families – and so many other marine creatures – have a future in oceans that are alive, thriving, and free.
