Every click that promises a better version of ourselves seems to arrive wrapped in cardboard and plastic.

Online shopping has turned buying clothes into a constant background activity: a scroll here, an add-to-cart there, a late-night “treat” after a hard day. But the rush we feel when we hit “buy now” rarely lasts. New clothes, once they arrive, quickly become just more things in our wardrobe, losing their shine almost as soon as the tags come off.

A recent survey shows how deep this runs. Many people admit they already own more than they need. In Hong Kong, around two-thirds of respondents say they have more than they truly require, and in China, 60% say the same. Despite this, people are still spending hours every day browsing and buying, often on impulse.

For many, these purchases are less about need and more about emotion. People shop to relieve stress, to break up boredom, to feel a momentary lift. Fashion becomes a quick fix: a new dress to feel confident, new shoes to feel refreshed, a new outfit to feel like someone different. But the relief is short-lived. The excitement fades quickly, replaced by guilt over money spent, clutter piling up, and a nagging sense of emptiness.

This is not an accident. Advertisers know how to tap into our deepest insecurities and desires for self-worth. They promise that a new look, a new trend, a new “you” is only one purchase away. The result is a cycle of materialism that leaves people “stuffocated”: surrounded by things, but starved of real satisfaction. Wardrobes overflow, parcels stack up, and yet the feeling that we are missing something only grows.

This cycle doesn’t just affect people; it affects the planet. The constant churn of buying more than we need drives more production, more waste, and more pressure on the Earth’s resources. When clothes are bought on impulse and quickly forgotten, they too often end up discarded, feeding a system that takes far more than the planet can sustain.

Breaking out of this trap starts with slowing down.

Instead of buying in the heat of the moment, pause. Before checking out, ask: Do I really need this? Will I still want it next week, next month? Sleeping on a decision before buying can be surprisingly powerful. What feels urgent at 11 p.m. on a shopping app often feels unnecessary the next morning.

Choosing what we do with our time can also shift everything. When stress hits, or boredom creeps in, it’s easy to reach for our phones and open a shopping app. But we can choose differently: a walk in the park instead of a trip to the mall, fresh air instead of fluorescent lights, birdsong instead of background music and sales announcements. Time in nature offers a kind of calm and connection that no parcel on the doorstep can match.

None of this means never buying anything again. It means buying more slowly, more consciously, and with more respect for ourselves and the world we share. When we step back from impulse and advertising tricks, we make space for something deeper than the fleeting thrill of a new purchase.

Less scrolling, fewer parcels, more sky, more trees. That’s where the real freedom from “stuffocation” begins.
