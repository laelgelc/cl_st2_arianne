In 1990, a Zimbabwean farmer stood in a parched field and told me about the drought that was destroying his crops. Back then, we spoke about “bad years” and “unlucky seasons.” Today, we know better: human-made climate change is turning what used to be rare disasters into a new and dangerous normal.

That conversation has stayed with me for decades. It was the beginning of an environmental journey that has now led, together with more than 2,000 fellow Climate Seniors, to the steps of the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. We travelled there along the Rhine, a river that has itself become a symbol of a warming world, to make a simple but urgent appeal: governments must protect their people from the escalating dangers of climate breakdown.

We are inspired by the growing number of successful climate lawsuits around the world. These cases show that the law can be a powerful tool when politics moves too slowly. Our hope is to help set a precedent that makes it clear: inadequate climate action is not just bad policy, it is a violation of fundamental rights.

My own sense of what is at stake is rooted in the landscapes where I grew up. In Switzerland, the glaciers were once seen as eternal. Names like Pizol were part of our mental map of the Alps – solid, icy, reassuring. Today, those glaciers are melting away before our eyes. What used to be a symbol of permanence has become a measure of how fast our world is changing.

For many years, I worked in academia. Eventually, I decided that I could contribute more directly by helping to fund green startups. Supporting people who are building solutions – from clean technologies to new ways of using resources more sparingly – felt like a practical response to a crisis that can otherwise seem overwhelming.

At 72, I joined Climate Seniors. We are older people, but we refuse to accept the idea that our role is to simply watch and worry. In 2016, we challenged Switzerland’s climate targets, arguing that they were far too weak to protect people, especially older women, from the health impacts of more frequent and intense heatwaves.

Our path through the courts was anything but smooth. We faced rejection after rejection. And yet, even as our claims were dismissed, the Swiss Supreme Court acknowledged a crucial fact: the climate crisis is real, and Switzerland is not doing enough. What it refused to do was draw the logical conclusion – that failing to act adequately is a breach of the state’s duty to protect its citizens.

To me, this is like seeing clear signs of avalanche danger and deciding not to close the slope. You recognise the risk, you see the evidence, but you leave people in harm’s way. That is not caution; it is negligence.

This is why we are now in Strasbourg. We are not there for ourselves alone, but for everyone who will live with the consequences of what is decided in these next few years. We know that one court case will not solve the climate crisis. But we also know that every strong legal decision adds weight to the moral and political imperative to act.

We have been told many times to be patient, to trust that gradual change will be enough. The vanishing ice on Pizol and the rising heat in our cities tell a different story. Patience, in the face of accelerating danger, becomes a form of surrender.

I have no intention of surrendering. Nor do the thousands of Climate Seniors who stand with me. We will continue to use every peaceful, democratic and legal means available to demand that our governments live up to their responsibilities.

The farmer in Zimbabwe, my grandchildren, the people suffering through record-breaking heatwaves – they are all part of the same story. It is the story of how we choose to respond when we finally understand that the crisis is not “out there” or “in the future,” but here, now, shaping the lives of millions.

We owe it to them to persist. And we will.
