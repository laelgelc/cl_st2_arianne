On International Women’s Day, fossil fuel companies often promote their gender diversity initiatives. Their public relations campaigns highlight images of women in hard hats, glossy brochures about inclusion, and statements about empowering women in the energy sector. Yet these same companies remain central drivers of the climate crisis, which in turn deepens inequalities and fuels violence against women and gender minorities.

Climate change is not gender neutral. When disasters hit, women and gender minorities are frequently at higher risk. They are more likely to face barriers in accessing relief, support, and resources, and more likely to experience heightened levels of sexual and physical violence in the aftermath. Climate-induced displacement, the breakdown of social networks, and the strain on already unequal systems create conditions where existing power imbalances are magnified.

These harms are particularly visible in communities living near fossil fuel extraction sites. The arrival of large, transient workforces in so‑called “man camps” has been linked to increased violence, including sexual violence, against women and gender minorities. During North Dakota’s Bakken oil boom, these dynamics became starkly apparent, with local communities facing intensified social and safety pressures as the boom reshaped their lives and environments.

The fossil fuel industry itself is deeply patriarchal. It employs relatively few women, maintains significant gender pay gaps, and reinforces broader patterns of inequality. While it may promote a progressive image on days like International Women’s Day, its core business model continues to undermine the safety, rights, and wellbeing of those already most at risk from climate impacts.

Confronting this reality means challenging both fossil fuel dependence and the injustices it sustains. Ending the cycle of harm requires a rapid shift away from coal, oil, and gas and towards renewable energy systems that do not rely on extraction-driven boomtowns and the social violence that accompanies them. This includes banning new fossil fuel projects and phasing out existing production in a way that aligns with climate justice, centering the needs and rights of women and gender minorities.

International Women’s Day cannot be reduced to a branding opportunity for the very companies driving the crisis. It must instead be a moment to demand an end to fossil fuels and to insist on a just, renewable future where gender justice and climate action go hand in hand.
