Around the world, people are already living through the reality of climate breakdown. In recent years, devastating floods, crippling droughts, raging wildfires, destructive cyclones and the creeping threat of sea level rise have torn through communities. Homes have been swept away, harvests ruined and lives lost. These are not isolated “natural disasters” but the predictable consequences of a warming planet.

What makes this even more shocking is that the solutions are already known. Clean, renewable energy could replace coal, oil and gas. Forests, oceans and wildlife could be protected and restored. Yet too many leaders have chosen inaction or deliberate ignorance, blocking the changes that could save lives. When those in power ignore science, delay climate action and side with polluters over people, they are not just negligent – they are allowing mass death and destruction to continue.

Despite this, there are powerful reasons for hope. Across the world, renewable energy is taking off. In countries like China, the United States and India, solar and wind power are being installed at huge scales. This shift is proving that a different energy system is possible – one that doesn’t rely on fossil fuels and doesn’t lock us into worsening climate chaos.

There have also been major efforts to protect the oceans. A proposal for a vast Antarctic Ocean sanctuary came close to success, backed by a vision of sustainable krill fishing and stronger marine protections. While it was not fully realised, the near-breakthrough showed how close the world is to agreeing large-scale protection for some of the planet’s most fragile and vital ecosystems.

Some industries are beginning to respond to public pressure as well. Campaigns have pushed companies in sectors like tuna and palm oil to start changing destructive practices. Moves toward more sustainable tuna fishing and reforms in palm oil supply chains show that when people speak out and organise, even powerful industries can be forced to shift.

A new generation is leading the way. Youth movements are calling out governments and corporations for their role in the climate crisis, refusing to accept a future defined by fires, floods and famine. Young people are striking, marching and organising in numbers never seen before, demanding that those responsible for the crisis be held to account and that real solutions be implemented now.

In the courts, too, the tide is beginning to turn. Communities and campaigners have won important legal victories against governments and fossil fuel companies, challenging weak climate policies and exposing the responsibility of major polluters. These cases are helping to rewrite what is considered acceptable behaviour in the face of a planetary emergency.

At the same time, more and more people are questioning a model of endless consumption. Movements against overconsumption are highlighting how the drive to produce and buy more and more stuff is fuelling emissions, deforestation and overfishing. By challenging this, they are opening space for new ideas about how we live well within the limits of the Earth.

All of this is happening against a stark backdrop. There is a limited window – described as just 12 years to act – to avoid locking in the worst impacts of climate change. Fossil fuel burning, deforestation and overfishing are still pushing the climate and ecosystems toward dangerous tipping points. The choice is clear: continue on a path of destruction, or change course while there is still time.

The call now is to stand with those who are telling the truth about the climate crisis and fighting for a green, just future. From young people on the streets, to communities in courtrooms, to those pushing for renewable energy, ocean sanctuaries, fairer supply chains and an end to reckless overconsumption, a global movement is already building the world we need.

There is still hope – but only if more people join in, refuse to accept delay and denial, and insist that real solutions are put in place. The disasters we see today are a warning. The response we choose will decide whether they become the new normal, or the turning point toward a safer, greener future for everyone.
