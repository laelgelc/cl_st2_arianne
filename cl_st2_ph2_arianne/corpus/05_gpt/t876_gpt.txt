On the International Day against Nuclear Tests, we are reminded that more than 2,000 nuclear tests have been carried out around the world since 1945. Each explosion has left an invisible legacy: irreversible radiation contamination of lands and oceans, and harm that reaches across generations.

This legacy is painfully clear in the story of the Rongelapese community of the Marshall Islands. Exposed to nuclear fallout, they were forced into exile from their irradiated homeland. Their experience is not only one of loss, but of extraordinary resilience. Survivors in the Marshall Islands have taken the courageous step of pursuing legal action against nuclear-armed states, insisting that those responsible for the damage be held to account.

They are not alone. In Japan, the Hibakusha – survivors of the atomic bombings – have spent their lives campaigning against nuclear weapons. Their testimonies have helped the world understand the human reality behind abstract words like “deterrence” and “tests.” Their calls for disarmament continue to shape the global movement to end nuclear weapons.

Greenpeace co-executive director Bunny McDiarmid has a deeply personal connection to this struggle. In 1985, she was on board the Greenpeace ship Rainbow Warrior as part of an operation to relocate the people of Rongelap to safer islands, away from the contamination that had made their home unlivable. That same year, the Rainbow Warrior was bombed by French secret agents in Auckland Harbour, an attack that killed photographer Fernando Pereira. The bombing was intended to silence protest against French nuclear testing in the Pacific, but instead drew the world’s attention to the injustice the Rongelapese and other Pacific peoples were facing.

Sustained public protest and global pressure helped force a halt to nuclear testing in 1996. Yet the damage did not end with the last test. Recent revelations have exposed the true scale of radioactive fallout from French nuclear tests in French Polynesia, confirming what affected communities have long said about the severity of contamination. Despite this, many victims still struggle for recognition, justice, and compensation.

On this day, the call is clear: the world must move beyond partial measures and adopt a United Nations treaty that bans nuclear weapons outright. Survivors from the Marshall Islands, the Hibakusha in Japan, and communities across test sites have already paid an unbearable price. Their courage and persistence demand that governments finally act to ensure no one ever suffers from nuclear testing again.
