Corporations are scrambling to present themselves as part of the solution to plastic pollution, but many of their favored “fixes” simply swap one problem for another. Rather than transforming the wasteful systems that generate mountains of single-use packaging, they are mostly changing the materials used to maintain the same throwaway model.

One popular shift is from plastic to paper packaging. At first glance, paper can seem like a greener choice. But scaling up paper packaging comes with a heavy cost for forests, which are already under pressure. Replacing single-use plastic with single-use paper does not challenge the basic idea that products should be designed to be used once and thrown away. It just shifts the environmental burden onto forests and the ecosystems and communities that depend on them.

Another corporate favorite is bioplastics. These are often marketed as “eco-friendly” or “compostable,” but they come with serious drawbacks. Bioplastics can compete with food crops for land and resources, raising concerns about their impact on agriculture and food systems. And in real-world conditions—outside of specialized industrial facilities—many bioplastics do not break down as promised. In nature, they can persist and contribute to pollution, while consumers are misled into believing they are harmless.

Then there is the push for “recyclable” plastics. Companies frequently highlight that their packaging is technically recyclable, but that does not mean it is actually recycled in practice. Most plastic still ends up in landfills, incinerators, or the environment. When plastics are recycled, they are often downcycled into lower-quality products that cannot be recycled again, prolonging but not preventing their journey to the waste stream. Labeling packaging as recyclable can create a false sense of progress while the overall volume of single-use plastics continues to grow.

All of these strategies—paper packaging, bioplastics, and recyclable plastics—have one thing in common: they leave the throwaway model intact. As long as companies are focused on finding new materials to feed a single-use system, they are not addressing the root cause of plastic pollution: the relentless production and disposal of short-lived products and packaging.

Real solutions require a different approach. Instead of chasing material substitutions that create new problems, companies must focus on reducing waste at the source. That means cutting back on unnecessary packaging and redesigning products and delivery systems so that single-use is no longer the default.

Central to this shift is investing in reuse and refill systems. These approaches move away from disposable packaging altogether, enabling containers and materials to be used multiple times rather than discarded after one use. Reuse and refill can dramatically reduce the volume of waste generated, and they offer a pathway to break free from the cycle of constantly extracting resources, manufacturing single-use items, and dealing with the pollution that follows.

Around the world, activists and communities are calling on corporations to adopt these real solutions. The demand is clear: it is not enough to change what single-use packaging is made from. Companies must change how they deliver their products, prioritize waste reduction, and commit to reuse and refill systems that genuinely tackle the plastic pollution crisis instead of simply reshaping it.
