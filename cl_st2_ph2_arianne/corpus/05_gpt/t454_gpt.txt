Every year, thousands of Indigenous leaders, elders, youth, and allies converge in Brasília for the Acampamento Terra Livre, the world’s largest Indigenous gathering. It is a powerful space of resistance and dialogue, where communities from across Brazil demand respect for their rights, protection of their lands, and a say in the decisions that shape their future.

This year, that gathering was canceled due to COVID-19. The decision reflects the immense vulnerability Indigenous Peoples face in the midst of a pandemic, especially in territories where health services are scarce and historical memories of disease brought from outside are still painfully present. The loss of this annual meeting is not only symbolic; it removes a crucial platform for Indigenous voices at a time when their rights and lives are under intensified threat.

Even in isolation, Indigenous communities are not shielded from the virus. Illegal invaders—such as miners and loggers—continue to enter Indigenous territories, bringing with them a heightened risk of infection. These invasions are not new, but in the context of COVID-19 they have become even more dangerous. At least ten deaths have already been reported, including that of a Yanomami boy, a tragedy that echoes the long history of disease devastating Indigenous populations since colonization.

The pandemic is unfolding on top of multiple, overlapping crises. In the Amazon, fires worsen respiratory problems—precisely the kind of health issue that increases vulnerability to COVID-19. At the same time, mercury contamination from illegal mining threatens the health of communities who depend on rivers and forests for their survival. These environmental assaults compound the risks posed by the virus, turning Indigenous territories into frontlines of a broader struggle for life, land, and dignity.

Government policy has deepened these dangers. Under President Bolsonaro, funding cuts to FUNAI, the federal agency responsible for Indigenous affairs, have undermined already fragile protections. Policies that weaken environmental and territorial safeguards have gone hand in hand with a surge in forest destruction. Deforestation alerts have doubled, and forest destruction has increased even within Indigenous territories—areas that have historically been among the most effective barriers against deforestation.

This is not only a human rights crisis; it is also a climate crisis. The destruction of forests in Indigenous lands threatens the Amazon’s capacity to regulate the global climate. As Indigenous territories are invaded and cleared, the lives of their peoples are put at risk, and the stability of the climate we all depend on is further undermined.

The COVID-19 pandemic has laid bare systemic vulnerabilities and inequalities. Indigenous communities are facing the virus on top of long-standing threats to their lands and ways of life. The cancellation of the Acampamento Terra Livre is a stark reminder of how deeply the pandemic has disrupted spaces of resistance and political participation, precisely when they are most needed.

In this moment, the demands of Indigenous Peoples in Brazil are urgent and clear: governments must protect their rights, their territories, and their lives. Protecting Indigenous lands means defending the Amazon and safeguarding the climate. The crisis exposes a simple truth—public policy must prioritize people and the planet over short-term exploitation. The choices made now will shape not only the future of Indigenous communities, but the future of the Amazon and the global climate as well.
