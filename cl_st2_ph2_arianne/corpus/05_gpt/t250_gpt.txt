World leaders are gathering at COP26 with a stark choice in front of them: act now to keep the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C goal alive, or lock the world into a far more dangerous future. Current national emission plans are nowhere near enough. Instead of a pathway to safety, they put us on track for a catastrophic 2.7°C of global heating.

That number is not an abstract statistic. It means more deadly heatwaves, stronger storms, rising seas, and escalating loss and damage for communities that have done the least to cause the crisis. The science is clear and the window to act is rapidly closing. COP26 cannot be another summit of empty promises and distant targets. It must deliver immediate, concrete action.

Around the world, people are already rising to meet this moment. Communities, youth movements, Indigenous peoples, and social justice groups are organizing, marching, and demanding an end to climate-wrecking policies. Activism is shifting what is politically possible, and legal victories are forcing governments and corporations to confront their responsibility. These people-powered wins show that change is not only necessary, it is achievable—if leaders choose courage over delay.

Greenpeace is going to COP26 with clear demands that reflect what justice and science require.

First, all new fossil fuel projects must stop, and the existing fossil fuel industry must be phased out. This transition has to be fast, but it also has to be fair. Workers and communities that currently depend on coal, oil, and gas need just transitions—plans that provide new, decent jobs and support, instead of leaving people behind. There is no safe climate future that includes expanding fossil fuels.

Second, governments must adopt ambitious plans to cut global emissions by half by 2030 and reach net zero by 2050. Those with the most historical responsibility and the greatest resources—rich nations—must lead the way. That means deeper, faster cuts in their own emissions, not pushing the burden onto poorer countries or future generations.

Third, the rules that govern international climate cooperation must be fair and effective. Greenpeace is calling for an approach that rejects carbon offsets as the scams they are. Offsets often allow polluters to claim “neutrality” on paper while continuing to emit, instead of driving real reductions. The world cannot afford accounting tricks disguised as climate action.

Finally, wealthy countries must fulfill their long-promised commitment of at least 100 billion US dollars in climate finance every year. This money is not charity; it is part of paying a climate debt. It must support vulnerable countries to build out clean energy, adapt to mounting climate impacts, and recover from the damage already being inflicted on homes, livelihoods, and ecosystems.

COP26 is a test of whether governments will listen to the people in the streets, the communities on the frontlines, and the courts that are increasingly holding them to account. The path to 1.5°C is narrow, but it still exists. With people power, clear demands, and no more excuses for delay, leaders can choose a livable future. Now they must prove they will.
