The planet has already warmed by 1.2°C since pre-industrial times, and the consequences are all around us: more intense heatwaves, shifting rainfall patterns, and rising seas. Yet even as the climate crisis accelerates, many governments and companies continue to respond with empty promises instead of real, rapid change.

Urgent action is needed to cut emissions at their source, which means transforming how we produce energy and food, and how we treat forests. Ending our reliance on fossil fuels and animal products, and halting deforestation, are all essential steps if we are to keep further warming in check.

Forests are one of our most powerful allies in the fight against climate change. They absorb and store vast amounts of carbon, helping to regulate the global climate. But when forests are destroyed, especially for industrial agriculture, this natural carbon storage is lost. Instead of soaking up carbon, destroyed forests release it into the atmosphere, driving even more warming. The damage doesn’t end there: deforestation also threatens biodiversity and the rights, livelihoods, and cultures of Indigenous Peoples whose territories are often on the frontlines of forest destruction.

When deforestation is included in emissions accounting, the picture of global responsibility becomes clearer. A Carbon Brief analysis that factors in deforestation ranks Brazil as the fourth biggest polluter. Under the Bolsonaro government, deforestation in the Amazon has surged, putting one of the world’s most important carbon stores at risk. This destruction is so extensive that the Amazon is now in danger of becoming a net carbon emitter, undermining its role as a crucial buffer against climate breakdown.

Industrial animal production is another major driver of the crisis. It is responsible for 19% of global greenhouse gas emissions, and nearly half of these emissions come from methane. Methane is a particularly potent greenhouse gas over the short term, which means reducing it quickly is vital for slowing warming in the coming decades. Cutting back on industrial animal production, and shifting towards more plant-based food systems, is therefore not just a dietary choice but a key climate solution.

The science is clear: the world is already dangerously warm, and every fraction of a degree matters. Ending fossil fuel dependence, transforming our food system away from animal products, and stopping deforestation are not optional extras—they are the core of any serious plan to confront the climate emergency and protect people, nature, and the global climate system we all depend on.
