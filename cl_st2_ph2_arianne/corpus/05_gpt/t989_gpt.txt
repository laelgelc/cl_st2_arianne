Drilling for oil in the Arctic is a gamble with stakes that are simply too high. The region’s remoteness, extreme weather and unique ecosystems make it one of the worst possible places to pursue risky fossil fuel projects. When you look closely at what Arctic drilling actually involves, ten clear reasons emerge for why it must be stopped.

First, the Arctic is an exceptionally harsh and unforgiving environment. Fierce storms, freezing temperatures, shifting sea ice and months of darkness make drilling operations inherently more dangerous than in most of the world’s oceans. Equipment is more likely to fail, workers face greater risks, and any accident is far harder to control. In such a setting, what might be a contained incident elsewhere can quickly escalate into a full-blown catastrophe.

Second, we do not need this oil. The demand that Arctic drilling is supposed to meet could be dramatically reduced with existing technologies, especially by improving fuel efficiency in vehicles. More efficient cars and trucks can cut oil use on a massive scale, but this progress is often held back when strong efficiency laws are blocked or weakened. Instead of opening up a fragile new frontier for drilling, we could meet our needs by choosing better policies and cleaner technologies.

Third, Arctic drilling is fundamentally at odds with climate goals. The Arctic is one of the most fragile and climate-sensitive regions on Earth, warming faster than much of the rest of the planet. Expanding fossil fuel extraction there pushes us further away from the emissions cuts needed to limit dangerous climate change. It makes no sense to drill in a region that is already on the frontlines of the climate crisis.

Fourth, the logistics of dealing with a major accident are stacked against us. If a blowout occurred, a relief well would likely be needed to stop it. But in the Arctic, the drilling season is short, and severe weather and ice can shut operations down for long stretches. That means a company might not be able to complete a relief well before conditions force them to halt work, potentially leaving oil gushing into the sea for months on end.

Fifth, recovering spilled oil in ice-covered waters is effectively impossible. Ice blocks access for ships and skimmers, hides oil from sight, and can trap and spread it over vast distances. Traditional methods used to clean up spills elsewhere simply do not work in the same way when the sea surface is frozen or choked with drifting ice. Once oil is in this environment, there is little that can be done to remove it.

Sixth, there is not enough emergency response capacity in the region. There are very few ships, aircraft, and specialized vessels nearby that could respond quickly and effectively to a major spill. Long distances, limited infrastructure and harsh conditions slow everything down. By the time help arrives, the damage could already be extensive and irreversible.

Seventh, cold Arctic waters slow the natural breakdown of oil. In warmer seas, some components of spilled oil can degrade more quickly. In the Arctic, low temperatures mean oil persists for much longer, continuing to contaminate coastlines, sea ice and the water column. A single spill could leave a toxic legacy that lasts for years or even decades.

Eighth, the wildlife that depends on this region is extraordinarily vulnerable to oil pollution. Birds that rest and feed on the water, whales that migrate through icy seas, seals that haul out on the ice, polar bears that hunt across it, and Arctic foxes that roam the coasts all face serious harm if their habitat is contaminated. Oil can coat feathers and fur, poison animals that ingest it, and destroy the food webs they rely on. In such a delicately balanced ecosystem, a major spill would be devastating.

Ninth, Arctic drilling is extremely expensive and risky for companies themselves. The experience of Cairn Energy, which spent around a billion dollars on Arctic exploration without finding commercially viable oil, shows just how high the financial stakes are. Companies pour vast sums into exploration and infrastructure in one of the toughest operating environments on Earth, with no guarantee of success and enormous potential liabilities if something goes wrong.

Tenth, even if all the projected Arctic oil were successfully extracted, it would only cover a small slice of global demand—about three years’ worth. In other words, we are being asked to accept immense environmental, climatic and economic risks for a very limited reward. When the potential payoff is so short-lived, the gamble looks even more reckless.

Taken together, these ten reasons form a clear picture: Arctic oil drilling is dangerous, unnecessary, incompatible with climate goals, nearly impossible to clean up, ruinous for wildlife, and wildly expensive for what amounts to just a few years of supply. The risks vastly outweigh the benefits. Instead of opening up the Arctic to new drilling, the world should focus on cutting demand for oil, improving efficiency and accelerating the shift to cleaner, safer energy sources.
