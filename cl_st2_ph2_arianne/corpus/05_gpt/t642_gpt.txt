For 15 days, viewers around the world are invited to dive into stories of resistance, resilience, and reinvention through an online film festival dedicated to the climate and environmental emergency. Over this two-week journey, 15 documentaries open windows onto the major ecological challenges of our time, the practical solutions already taking root, and the power of global citizen initiatives to push change forward.

All films are available to watch online for free during the festival. Each screening is a chance not only to learn, but to participate. Viewers can support the films and the issues they raise by voting for the People’s Award, which goes to the documentary that receives the most votes, and by contributing to the Favourite Film Award, which honours the film with the highest number of views. After the online festival, the winning films will be screened in several French cities, becoming focal points for public debates and collective reflection.

Among the featured documentaries, “Ground for Hope” explores how sustainable farming can restore soils, protect biodiversity, and support farming communities. It follows those who are rethinking the way we grow food, showing how agricultural practices can shift away from destructive models toward systems that work with nature rather than against it.

“Secret of the Oceans” turns to coastal and ocean communities on the frontlines of climate disruption. The film reveals how rising temperatures and changing seas are reshaping lives, livelihoods, and ecosystems, while also highlighting the knowledge and determination of those fighting to protect their marine environments.

“Banking Nature” examines the growing financialisation of the natural world. It looks at how markets and financial products are being built around ecosystems and species, and raises questions about the risks this poses to nature when profit becomes a driving force in conservation.

Other films in the festival address a wide spectrum of urgent issues: nuclear power and its risks, the dysfunctions of the dairy industry, the accelerating extinction of wildlife, land-grabbing that displaces communities and destroys ecosystems, the toxic legacy of electronic waste, and more. Together, they trace the connections between environmental destruction, social injustice, and economic systems, while also shining a light on those who are standing up, organising, and building alternatives.

This festival is an invitation to watch, reflect, and act. Each film offers not only a diagnosis of what is going wrong, but also glimpses of what can be done differently. By taking the time to engage with these stories, sharing them, and casting a vote, viewers help amplify the voices of communities, experts, and activists working for change.

The organisers encourage everyone who participates to go one step further: to translate inspiration into simple, concrete actions in daily life. Whether it is rethinking consumption habits, supporting sustainable agriculture, reducing waste, or joining local campaigns, the films show that solutions are already in motion and that individual choices, multiplied across millions of people, can help shift the course we are on.

For 15 days, these 15 documentaries transform screens into spaces of encounter and mobilization. Watching, voting, and talking about these films is a way to stand with those on the frontlines of environmental struggles and to be part of a growing global movement for a more just and liveable planet.
