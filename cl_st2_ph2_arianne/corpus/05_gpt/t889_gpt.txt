Across the world, our food system is at a crossroads. A new report from iPES-Food sets out a clear roadmap for moving away from industrial agriculture and towards sustainable, ecological farming – and makes it clear why that shift can’t wait.

Industrial agriculture is built on monocultures: vast areas planted with a single crop, season after season. These systems are propped up by toxic pesticides, synthetic fertilizers, and heavy use of antibiotics. The result is a trail of damage. Soils are being depleted and eroded, water and landscapes are polluted, and pollinators – essential to many of the foods we rely on – are in decline. Rather than securing our food supply, this model undermines the very foundations of long-term food security.

The iPES-Food report highlights agroecological farming as a proven alternative. Around the world, farmers are showing that working with nature, not against it, can build resilience to climate shocks and market volatility, restore biodiversity, and improve farmer incomes. Agroecology integrates diverse crops and livestock, values local knowledge, and regenerates soils and ecosystems. These practices don’t just produce food; they help safeguard the natural systems that food production depends on.

Despite this evidence, powerful barriers are slowing the transition. Corporate lobbying by pesticide and animal feed companies defends the status quo and shapes policies in favor of industrial inputs. Much of agricultural research has been privatized, skewing innovation towards products and technologies that benefit industry rather than the public interest. At the same time, a persistent misconception continues to dominate public debate: that industrial, input-heavy farming is the only way to feed a growing global population.

The roadmap laid out by iPES-Food calls for dismantling these barriers and redirecting support towards agroecological systems. That means shifting public and private investment, reorienting research agendas, and challenging the myths that keep industrial agriculture in place.

This transformation cannot be left to farmers alone. Governments need to adopt policies that reward ecological practices instead of pollution and waste. Businesses must rethink supply chains and sourcing, backing producers who protect soils, water, and biodiversity. Producers need access to training, fair markets, and decision-making power to adopt agroecological methods at scale. And consumers, through their choices and their voices, can help drive demand for food grown in ways that respect people and the planet.

The message from iPES-Food is clear: a sustainable, resilient, and fair food system is within reach, but it will take coordinated action from all of us to get there.
