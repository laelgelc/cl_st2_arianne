7-Eleven Taiwan has announced a commitment to phase out single-use plastics by 2050, with a target of reducing plastic use by 10% every year. This marks the first time a major convenience store chain in Asia has set a timeline to end single-use plastics, and it reflects the growing pressure on retailers to take responsibility for the waste they generate.

This decision follows two years of sustained campaigning by Greenpeace East Asia. During this period, Greenpeace released retailer rankings to highlight which companies were lagging or leading on plastic reduction, and conducted a 2020 investigation that uncovered the scale of the problem: 7-Eleven stores in Taiwan were generating 15,000 tons of plastic waste every year. The investigation helped expose how deeply single-use packaging is embedded in everyday retail, and how urgently systemic change is needed.

Public support has been central to pushing for this commitment. A petition calling on 7-Eleven to tackle its plastic footprint gathered 210,000 signatures, sending a clear message that customers want real action on waste. In response to mounting pressure, the company has begun testing alternatives, including cup rental schemes and reusable delivery packaging pilots. These pilots show that practical solutions already exist and can be integrated into convenience store operations.

While the 2050 phase-out pledge is a significant milestone, Greenpeace is calling for faster timelines and bolder implementation. Annual 10% reductions, if fully achieved, would add up over time—but the climate and plastic pollution crises demand that companies move as quickly as possible. Greenpeace is also urging 7-Eleven to expand these commitments beyond Taiwan and adopt strong, reusable-focused policies across its global operations.

Other retailers in the region are beginning to move as well. Family Mart has introduced reusable container and cup programs, showing that major chains can redesign their services around reusables. Meanwhile, the food delivery platform Foodpanda has rolled out plastic-free options in Tainan, demonstrating that the shift away from single-use plastics is possible even in fast-paced, convenience-focused sectors.

Together, these developments signal a turning point for retail in East Asia. The challenge now is to turn pilot projects into standard practice, voluntary pledges into binding plans, and isolated national initiatives into global commitments that match the scale of the plastic crisis.
