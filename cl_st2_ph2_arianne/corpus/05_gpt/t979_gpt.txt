For two years, Volkswagen worked behind the scenes to weaken ambitious European laws designed to make cars more efficient, cut CO2 emissions and reduce our dependence on oil. Instead of backing strong climate action, the company lobbied against the very targets needed to protect our planet.

That changed because 526,000 people refused to let it continue.

Supporters across Europe and beyond came together to challenge VW’s obstruction. A viral Star Wars parody ad exposed the company’s role as the “dark side” of the car industry, spreading rapidly online and turning public attention onto VW’s lobbying. Activists dressed as stormtroopers took the message to the streets and to VW events, making it impossible for the company to hide from its climate responsibilities. Direct actions at major car shows kept the pressure on, confronting VW at the heart of its global marketing machine.

This wave of public pressure worked. Faced with more than half a million people demanding change, VW reversed its opposition and threw its weight behind stronger EU laws for cleaner, more efficient cars.

The impact of this shift is far-reaching. Stronger efficiency standards mean less pollution driving climate change and a real step towards protecting vulnerable places like the Arctic. It also sends a clear signal that the age of inefficient combustion engines is coming to an end. In the wake of this campaign, VW has committed to becoming the world’s greenest car company.

This victory belongs to everyone who signed, shared, marched, dressed up, or took action. It shows that when hundreds of thousands of people stand together, even one of the world’s biggest carmakers can be pushed to change course and back the laws we need for a safer climate.
