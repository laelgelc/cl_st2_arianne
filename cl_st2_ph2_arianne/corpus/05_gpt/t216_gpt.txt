In April 2021, the Japanese government decided to discharge radioactive water from the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station into the Pacific Ocean. Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) plans to dilute this contaminated water and release it via an undersea pipeline. For people living and working along the Fukushima coast, this decision is not an abstract policy choice but a direct threat to their livelihoods, their communities, and their relationship with the sea.

In November 2021, Greenpeace conducted a survey that included an interview with local fisherman Mr. Haruo Ono. His words reflect years of frustration, fear, and anger. For over a decade, he has watched the impacts of the nuclear disaster unfold and has lived with the consequences for Fukushima’s fishing industry. The government and TEPCO’s decision to proceed with ocean discharge has deepened a sense of betrayal that has built up since 2011.

Mr. Ono described the pain felt by local fishers who have struggled for years to rebuild trust in the safety and quality of Fukushima’s seafood. He pointed to a long history of dishonesty, broken promises, and shifting assurances from both the government and TEPCO. According to him, this pattern has eroded any confidence that local communities can place in official statements about safety or long-term impacts. The decision to release the water into the ocean, despite strong local concerns, is seen as yet another betrayal.

He also highlighted that contaminated water is still accumulating at the Fukushima plant. Rather than accepting ocean discharge as the only option, he believes there is potential for more storage on land. From his perspective, the rush to release the water ignores alternatives that could reduce risks to the marine environment and coastal communities. The continued buildup of water, in his view, should be met with a serious commitment to expanding storage and exploring other solutions, not defaulting to the ocean as a dumping ground.

A central concern for Mr. Ono is the long-term radiation risk posed by substances such as tritium and carbon-14 contained in the water. He fears that these radionuclides could accumulate over time in the marine environment, with consequences that may not be immediately visible but could emerge over years or decades. For fishers, whose work and identity are bound to the sea, the possibility of long-term contamination is not just a scientific question—it is a direct threat to their future.

These worries extend beyond individual livelihoods to the fate of future generations and the broader ocean ecosystem. Mr. Ono spoke about the risk that the discharge poses to the children and young people who might wish to continue fishing, as well as to the health of marine life that sustains coastal communities. The potential for lingering radioactive substances to affect the ocean over the long term is, for him, a profound moral and ecological concern.

Throughout his interview, he repeatedly returned to the issue of trust. After years of assurances that were later broken or revised, he sees the discharge decision as another instance where the voices of those most affected have been sidelined. He called on the government and TEPCO to listen seriously to local residents, particularly those whose lives are directly tied to the sea. For Mr. Ono, genuine dialogue and respect for community perspectives are essential if there is to be any path forward that does not sacrifice the ocean and the people who depend on it.
