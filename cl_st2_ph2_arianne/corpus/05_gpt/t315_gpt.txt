Taiwan is in the grip of its worst drought in 56 years. Over the past 18 months, the island has endured a prolonged dry spell, with no typhoons making landfall last summer. This has left key reservoirs severely depleted: Techi Reservoir has seen its volume drop by 73.3%, Baoshan Second Reservoir by 96.2%, and Zeng-wen Reservoir by 81.1%. These shrinking water supplies are now rippling through communities, ecosystems, and the economy.

One of Taiwan’s most famous landmarks, Sun Moon Lake, has fallen to record-low water levels. Large areas of the lakebed have turned into exposed mudflats, reshaping the landscape and undermining a vital tourism industry. Businesses that depend on boat tours and lake-side visitors are struggling as the water recedes and the scenery that once drew crowds is transformed.

Urban and rural areas alike are feeling the pressure. In Taichung, water shutoffs have become part of daily life, disrupting households and industry. Farmers are watching their crops fail as irrigation water runs short. Tea growers are already reporting a 20% decline in harvests, a serious blow in a sector where margins are often tight and livelihoods closely tied to seasonal patterns of rain.

The current crisis is unfolding against a backdrop of projected climate impacts that point to more frequent and intense droughts. Scientific projections show that by the middle of this century, Taiwan could see a 13.2% reduction in spring rainfall, a crucial period for replenishing water supplies and supporting agriculture. By the end of the century, the number of typhoons affecting the island is expected to be cut in half. While typhoons can be destructive, they also play a key role in refilling reservoirs and maintaining water availability. Fewer typhoons mean fewer opportunities for natural replenishment.

At the same time, Taiwan’s energy system remains heavily dependent on fossil fuels, which are driving the climate crisis that intensifies these extremes. More than 80% of the island’s energy still comes from coal, oil, and gas, even as solar and wind power continue to grow. This dependence not only contributes to global heating but also deepens Taiwan’s vulnerability to climate-related shocks like the current drought.

In the face of this, Greenpeace is calling for a faster and more ambitious climate response in Taiwan. This includes setting a clear and credible timeline to reach net zero emissions before 2050, aligning with the urgency of the science and the scale of the impacts already being felt. Greenpeace is also urging the adoption of carbon pricing to make polluters pay for their emissions and to accelerate the shift away from fossil fuels.

The drying reservoirs, exposed lakebeds, water shutoffs, and damaged harvests are not isolated events. They are part of a pattern that underscores the need for rapid, systemic change. By committing to a net zero pathway ahead of 2050 and implementing strong measures such as carbon pricing, Taiwan can address the root causes of the climate crisis while protecting communities, safeguarding water resources, and building a more resilient future.
