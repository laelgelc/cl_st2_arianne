COVID-19 has shaken our daily lives in ways that few of us could have imagined. Routines have been upended, jobs and incomes are under threat, and many people are facing isolation and anxiety. In the middle of this upheaval, it’s vital to remember that our responses can be rooted in love, compassion and solidarity—and that alongside personal actions, we need systemic solutions that protect people and the planet.

Even when we can’t be physically close, there are many ways to support each other safely. Social distancing doesn’t have to mean social disconnection. Phone calls, video chats, online hangouts, messages and letters can help keep relationships strong and reduce loneliness. Reaching out regularly to friends, neighbours and colleagues—especially those who live alone, are older, or are at higher risk—can make a real difference.

Practical help matters too. For people who can’t or shouldn’t leave their homes, offering to pick up groceries, medicines or other essentials and leaving them safely at the door can ease both risk and worry. At the same time, preparing for disruption doesn’t mean hoarding. Buying what we reasonably need and leaving enough for others helps ensure that everyone in our communities can access food, hygiene products and other basics.

The pandemic has also fuelled fear and racism, particularly against people of Chinese descent and others of Asian heritage. Challenging racist comments and behaviour, standing in solidarity with those targeted, and insisting that this crisis is not an excuse for discrimination are essential acts of care. Compassion must extend across borders, backgrounds and identities.

Information is another important form of support. Sharing accurate health advice, amplifying reliable sources, and gently correcting misinformation in our networks can protect people’s health and reduce panic. Simple, proven measures—like frequent and thorough handwashing—remain among the most effective ways we can protect ourselves and others.

Many are facing serious financial hardship as work is cut back or lost. Government financial aid can provide crucial relief, and recognising the importance of these measures helps build support for social protections that keep people safe in times of crisis. Beyond state support, individual and community initiatives like fundraising for those who’ve lost income can help bridge gaps and show people they’re not alone.

Housing is another pressure point. Landlords who are in a position to do so can help by freezing or reducing rent, or offering flexible payment plans. These acts of solidarity can prevent people from being pushed into impossible choices between food, medicine and shelter.

Even in isolation, life’s important moments continue. Birthdays, anniversaries and other milestones can be marked through virtual celebrations—online parties, shared meals over video, or coordinated moments of joy that maintain a sense of connection and continuity. Sharing positive stories of care, creativity and resilience helps counter despair and reminds us of our collective strength.

While COVID-19 is a health crisis, it has also laid bare deep inequalities in our societies. Those with the least security—precarious workers, people in low-paid jobs, marginalised communities—are often hit hardest. The pandemic is exposing how fragile many systems are, and how urgently we need to redesign them so that care, fairness and resilience are at their core.

This is why responses must go beyond short-term fixes. Public money should prioritise people and the public good, not entrench harmful industries. Bailouts for fossil fuel companies would lock us further into a polluting, unstable future at the very moment we need to be building something better. Instead, this is a critical opportunity to push for a green stimulus that creates jobs, supports communities and accelerates the shift to cleaner energy and more sustainable ways of living.

The choices made now can move us toward a society that is both more resilient to crises and more caring in everyday life. By combining practical acts of kindness—checking in on others, sharing resources fairly, challenging racism, supporting those in financial difficulty—with demands for systemic change, we can respond to COVID-19 in a way that honours our interconnectedness.

Love and compassion are not a soft response to a hard crisis; they are a powerful foundation for the transformations we need. As we navigate this pandemic, we can insist that recovery efforts tackle inequality, reject fossil fuel bailouts, and invest instead in a green, just future—one where everyone has what they need not only to survive, but to thrive.
