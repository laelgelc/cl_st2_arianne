When we talk about climate justice, we are also talking about human rights, dignity, and whose lives are valued when disaster strikes. The struggle for LGBT rights and the fight for climate justice are deeply connected, because the same systems that marginalize people because of who they are also determine who is most exposed, least protected, and last in line for support when climate impacts hit.

Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines was one of the strongest storms ever recorded, and its devastation exposed these overlapping injustices. Among the survivors were LGBT people who not only endured the storm itself, but also the discrimination and exclusion that followed. Their stories show how resilience, solidarity, and community power can flourish even in the harshest conditions—and why climate advocacy must recognize people in all their identities.

Arthur’s experience shows what it means to push through prejudice to help others. Before the typhoon, he faced discrimination as an LGBT person. After Haiyan, he stepped into a leadership role in relief efforts, proving that those who are often sidelined are in fact central to community survival and recovery. His story challenges the idea that LGBT people are simply “vulnerable”; it shows them as organizers, leaders, and first responders in times of crisis.

For Nityalila, a musician, the climate crisis became deeply personal when she felt its impacts in her own life. Those experiences did not just move her to speak up about climate change—they also helped her find the courage to come out. By using her voice and her art to raise awareness, she connects the emotional truth of climate impacts with the lived reality of being LGBT in a world that too often refuses to see or protect those at the margins.

Pierce’s journey is one of listening and learning. Through hearing the horrific experiences of others, he came to understand intersectionality and privilege more clearly. Climate disasters do not hit everyone equally, and Pierce’s reflections show how important it is for those with relative safety or advantage to recognize it, and to stand with those who face compounded risks because of their gender identity, sexuality, class, or other aspects of who they are.

Contributors like Edwin Nichols remind us that there is immense power in communities that refuse to be divided. By drawing parallels between the resistance and courage of LGBT communities during the Stonewall riots and the collective response to climate disasters, he highlights a shared legacy of struggle and solidarity. Both movements confront systems of oppression, whether they appear as police violence and legal discrimination or as political inaction and neglect in the face of escalating climate crises.

The lesson running through these stories is clear: oppressions are linked, and so must be our responses. Climate justice work that ignores LGBT rights leaves the most affected without protection or voice. LGBT advocacy that overlooks climate breakdown misses a central threat to the safety and future of many in the community, especially in frontline countries like the Philippines.

A truly just society demands that we see people in all their complexity. It means recognizing that an LGBT person surviving a super-typhoon is not just facing extreme weather, but also navigating social stigma, exclusion from services, and the daily risks of being who they are. It means understanding that the fight for safe housing, access to relief, and protection from violence is part of the same struggle as the fight for equal rights, recognition, and freedom from discrimination.

The stories of Arthur, Nityalila, Pierce, and others are not only about surviving a disaster; they are about transforming pain into power, isolation into organizing, and fear into visibility. They call on all of us—climate activists, human rights defenders, and allies—to stand together, to build movements that are as interconnected as the injustices we face, and to ensure that no one is left behind as the climate crisis deepens.

Solidarity across struggles is not optional; it is the only way forward.
