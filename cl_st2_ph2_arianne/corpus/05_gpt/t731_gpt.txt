Nora Bateson’s book *Small Arcs of Larger Circles* invites us to see the world as a living, learning tapestry rather than a set of separate, mechanical parts. Instead of isolating problems and trying to “fix” them with linear solutions, Bateson points us toward the mutual learning that takes place within and between living systems—ecosystems, communities, families, and societies.

A central theme in the book is that life thrives through permeable boundaries. In living systems, nothing is truly isolated. Forests exchange nutrients through soil networks; human cultures evolve through contact and conversation; even individual cells adapt in relation to what surrounds them. These porous edges are where interaction, adaptation, and transformation occur. Bateson emphasizes that it is in these relational spaces—between people, between species, between contexts—that learning is constantly underway.

To describe this living, relational reality, Bateson introduces the term “vitae” to refer to interconnected living entities. Rather than treating life as a collection of separate organisms, “vitae” evokes a woven field of relationships. Within this field, Bateson proposes the concept of “symmathesy”—systems of mutual learning. In symmathesic systems, every part is learning with and from every other part. A forest is not just a backdrop for individual trees, and a society is not just a sum of individuals. Each is a living learning process, shaped by countless interactions that extend across time, space, and context.

This view stands in stark contrast to mechanistic models that treat systems like machines, with fixed parts and predictable outputs. Bateson challenges the idea that complex issues—whether ecological, social, or political—can be understood or addressed through isolated, cause-and-effect thinking. Instead, she highlights how patterns of relationship, feedback, and context shape what becomes possible. Change, in this sense, is not just about swapping one policy or technology for another; it is about shifting the underlying patterns that connect us.

Drawing from ecology and art, Bateson illustrates how change is always relational. In ecological terms, cellular adaptation depends on signals from the surrounding environment; cells adjust, respond, and reorganize in relation to what they encounter. In artistic practice, meaning is co-created between creator, audience, and context. These examples underscore a shared principle: nothing changes alone. Every shift is a shift in relationship.

This relational understanding is also at the heart of Bateson’s Warm Data Labs. These are spaces designed for “trans-contextual” conversations—discussions that deliberately move across multiple contexts at once. Instead of focusing on a single dimension of a problem, participants explore how issues are entangled with family, economy, ecology, culture, technology, and more.

In a Warm Data Lab on carbon emissions, for example, the conversation would not be confined to technical metrics or policy targets. Participants might reflect on how carbon-intensive habits are tied to housing, food systems, work patterns, cultural expectations, and histories of inequality. The aim is not to arrive at a simple yes/no or for/against position, but to sense how many different layers and relationships are involved. By avoiding binary positions, Warm Data Labs create room for participants to notice patterns that are usually overlooked—how efforts in one area might have unintended consequences in another, or how personal experiences intersect with global dynamics.

This process does not produce quick answers. Instead, it cultivates sensitivity to complexity and interdependence. In the context of social and environmental injustices, that sensitivity is crucial. When we recognize that injustices are maintained by patterns of relationship—economic, cultural, political, and ecological—we can begin to imagine responses that work at the level of those patterns, rather than treating symptoms in isolation.

Bateson’s work suggests that addressing intertwined crises, from climate disruption to inequality, requires more than new data or better arguments. It calls for new ways of learning together. Symmathesy, permeable boundaries, and trans-contextual dialogue offer a language for this shift. They remind us that we are participants in living systems of mutual learning, not observers standing outside them.

In this light, change becomes less about imposing solutions and more about participating in the ongoing re-patterning of relationships. By attending to how we relate—to each other, to other species, to place, and to the many contexts we inhabit—we can begin to foster the kinds of transformations that living systems know best: adaptive, emergent, and deeply interconnected.
