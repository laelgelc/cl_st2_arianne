Illegal mining continues to spread through the Amazon, putting local communities’ health and livelihoods at serious risk. In recent weeks, rumors of gold in the Madeira River have drawn hundreds of mining rafts to the region near Autazes, in Amazonas state. What is happening there is not an isolated episode, but part of a broader pattern of environmental destruction and institutional neglect.

On 23 November, Greenpeace Brazil documented this illegal activity on the Madeira. The images and testimonies from the field show how quickly mining fronts can expand once word of “new gold” circulates. The rafts are not operating in a vacuum: miners receive support from businessmen and politicians in nearby municipalities such as Humaitá, helping to sustain and legitimize the invasion of rivers and forests.

One of the most harmful and persistent impacts of this type of mining is mercury contamination. Mercury is used to separate gold from sediment, and in the process it ends up in the water. From there it spreads through the food chain, affecting fish and, ultimately, the people and communities who depend on the river for food, income and culture. The result is a toxic legacy that can last for generations.

Despite the scale of the problem and widespread awareness of these impacts, Brazil’s environmental agencies have been weakened. Under the Bolsonaro government, Ibama (the federal environmental agency) and Ipaam (the Amazonas state environmental agency) have faced cuts in resources and capacity. This undermines their ability to monitor vast territories, respond quickly to new invasions and enforce existing laws.

Even in this hostile context, public pressure has forced some action. On 28 November, an operation on the Madeira River destroyed 70 mining rafts and led to the arrest of 10 miners. However, the effectiveness of this operation was compromised. A public announcement by Vice-President Hamilton Mourão, made before the action took place, gave advance warning to those involved in the illegal activity, allowing many to escape.

The situation on the Madeira reflects a much larger trend across the Amazon. According to data from MapBiomas, mining areas in Brazil sextupled between 1985 and 2020, with the vast majority of this expansion occurring in the Amazon region. The growth has been particularly intense within Indigenous lands and conservation units, areas that are supposed to be shielded from destructive activities and that play a crucial role in safeguarding biodiversity, cultural diversity and climate stability.

This rapid expansion of mining in protected and vulnerable territories is happening in the midst of a global climate crisis. Yet the Brazilian federal government has shown a lack of political will to protect the forest and the people who depend on it. The case of the Madeira River, the weakened state of Ibama and Ipaam, and the alarming MapBiomas data all point in the same direction: without strong, consistent enforcement and a clear commitment to defending the Amazon, illegal mining will continue to advance, deepening contamination, violence and deforestation in one of the planet’s most vital regions.
