Greenpeace’s ships have long been at the heart of its environmental activism, carrying crews, campaigners, and supporters across the world’s oceans. They are more than just means of transport: they are moving symbols of resistance, hope, and determination in the struggle for environmental justice.

In 2022, this fleet entered a new chapter. After years of service, Greenpeace said goodbye to the Esperanza, a ship that had played a central role in countless campaigns. Its retirement marked the end of an era for many who had sailed on board or followed its journeys from afar. At the same time, a new vessel joined the fleet: the Witness. With this addition, Greenpeace’s ships now include the Witness, the Rainbow Warrior, and the Arctic Sunrise.

These ships have continued to play a vital role in a world facing overlapping crises. Amid the war in Ukraine, they have stood as vessels of peace, carrying a message that environmental protection and human security are deeply connected. Their presence on the water underscores Greenpeace’s commitment to non-violent action, even in times of conflict.

Throughout the year, the Rainbow Warrior, Arctic Sunrise, and Witness have been out on the frontlines of environmental campaigns. They have taken part in missions, protests, and actions aimed at protecting the planet and advancing environmental justice. From confronting ecological destruction to supporting communities defending their rights, the ships have carried stories of resistance and courage across the globe.

To honor this pivotal year—marked by both farewell and new beginnings—Greenpeace is sharing a collection of inspiring photographs of these iconic vessels. The images capture them in action on the high seas, at protests, and in the midst of campaigns that bring the fight for a safer, fairer world to life. Through these photos, supporters can witness how the ships continue to inspire millions and remain powerful symbols in the ongoing struggle to protect the Earth.
