Staying home during COVID-19 is an act of care, especially for those most vulnerable to the virus and to systemic injustices, including many Indigenous communities. But quarantine doesn’t mean climate activism has to stop. It means reimagining how we show up, protect each other, and keep building a safer, fairer world from our homes.

One powerful place to start is at the dinner table. Conversations with family or housemates about what’s happening to our climate locally can spark understanding and action. Talking about nearby air pollution, extreme weather, or changes in local ecosystems helps make the crisis real and immediate, instead of something distant and abstract. These conversations can lay the groundwork for shared decisions about how your household wants to respond.

Connection with others remains at the heart of any movement. While in-person meetings and marches are paused or limited, this is a moment to build relationships with advocacy groups online. Reaching out to local climate organisations, community groups, or youth movements via email, social media, or video calls can help you plug into ongoing campaigns and find ways to contribute from home. Joining their mailing lists or online meetings keeps you in the loop and reminds you that you’re part of something much larger than your living room.

Staying informed is another key piece of sustaining activism in quarantine. Books, documentaries, and webinars offer a way to deepen understanding of the climate crisis, its roots, and the solutions already being fought for. They can help connect the dots between climate change, health, inequality, and the rights of communities on the frontlines. Online forums and discussion groups create space to process what you’re learning, ask questions, and share resources with others who care.

Digital tools also open up creative forms of climate action. Social media can be used deliberately to spread accurate information and counter misinformation. People are designing Instagram filters that highlight climate messages, coordinating Twitter storms to push climate issues into public conversation, and using TikTok to share short, engaging videos that break down complex topics or showcase everyday climate-friendly practices. These actions can help keep pressure on decision-makers and maintain visibility for climate justice at a time when traditional news cycles are dominated by the pandemic.

Quarantine is also an opportunity to look closely at daily habits. Food choices are one area where individual and collective shifts can add up. Livestock production is responsible for 14.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions, so reducing meat consumption can be a meaningful step. Experimenting with plant-based recipes, trying new ingredients, or dedicating certain days of the week to meat-free meals can be both practical and empowering. Sharing recipes and experiences online can encourage others and make the transition feel more communal.

Beyond food, many people are using this time to rethink their relationship with stuff. Minimising single-use plastics, reusing items wherever possible, and making recycling a consistent habit are all ways to cut down on waste. Simple changes—like choosing reusable containers, repairing rather than replacing, or repurposing materials—can shift how we value the things we own. Growing some of your own food, whether in a garden, on a balcony, or on a windowsill, can reduce reliance on long supply chains and reconnect you with the sources of your meals.

Preventing waste is also an act of solidarity. Using resources carefully, sharing what you can, and avoiding unnecessary purchases can ease pressure on systems already stretched by the pandemic and the climate crisis. These everyday choices are not a substitute for systemic change, but they are a way of aligning personal life with broader demands for justice and sustainability.

Maintaining climate activism during quarantine is about weaving together many threads: caring for vulnerable communities by staying home, turning household conversations into shared commitments, strengthening ties with advocacy groups, learning continuously, using digital platforms for creative action, and reshaping habits around food and consumption. Each of these actions may seem small on its own, but together they help sustain momentum, build resilience, and keep the vision of a livable, just future alive through uncertain times.
