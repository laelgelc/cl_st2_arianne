The FSO SAFER, a massive tanker loaded with 1.1 million barrels of oil, is currently anchored off Yemen’s Hodeidah port. It has not received proper maintenance since 2014 because of the ongoing conflict in the country. This is happening in the middle of what is described as the world’s worst humanitarian crisis, affecting 24 million people.

The tanker is rapidly deteriorating. Reported recent failures include flooding on board, non-functional fire-fighting equipment, and a broken inert gas system, which is crucial for preventing explosions. These problems dramatically increase the risk of a catastrophic oil spill or even an explosion.

If the FSO SAFER fails, the resulting spill could be up to four times larger than the Exxon Valdez disaster. Such an event would have devastating consequences for the region’s marine environment and people’s livelihoods. Fisheries and coral reefs could be severely damaged, desalination plants that provide clean water could be forced to shut down, and access for life-saving humanitarian aid could be further disrupted.

In response to this urgent threat, Greenpeace is calling for strong, UN-led diplomatic efforts to secure immediate action. This includes a thorough, independent assessment of the vessel’s condition, the safe transfer of the oil to another secure vessel, and robust preparations for a potential spill response. These steps are essential to prevent a disaster that would deepen an already dire humanitarian situation and cause long-lasting environmental harm.
