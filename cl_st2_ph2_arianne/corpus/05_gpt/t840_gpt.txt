Dr. Paul Johnston, a Greenpeace scientist, describes climate change as a crisis that will not destroy the planet itself, but will leave it profoundly altered. He stresses that many changes are already “committed” – such as sea level rise and growing food insecurity – and that these will shape the lives of people and ecosystems for generations to come. While the Earth as a physical system will continue, he underlines that the real risk is to human societies, vulnerable communities, and the natural world as we know it.

He argues that the critical question now is not whether change will happen, but how severe it will be. Acting immediately can still minimize the damage, limit the worst impacts, and protect as many people and species as possible. Delaying action, by contrast, locks in harsher outcomes and reduces the options available to respond. In this context, Johnston is clear that climate denial has no basis in reality. He characterizes denial of climate science as delusional, given the overwhelming evidence of human-driven warming and its consequences.

Johnston also warns about the lure of technological “quick fixes” such as geoengineering. He sees geoengineering as a false solution that risks distracting from the urgent work of cutting emissions and transforming energy, food, and economic systems. Rather than relying on large-scale manipulation of the climate system with unknown side effects, he argues that the focus must remain on proven measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and protect ecosystems.

Despite the seriousness of the crisis, Johnston points to important progress that has been made in environmental protection. Over recent decades, public pressure and scientific evidence have driven stronger regulations, cleaner technologies, and greater awareness of environmental limits. These advances show that change is possible when science, policy, and public engagement align.

He emphasizes that individuals are not powerless in the face of global challenges. Personal choices to reduce waste, consume less, and live more sustainably matter not only for their direct impact but also for the influence they have on others. By changing habits, talking about climate change, and demonstrating alternatives, people can help shift social norms and build broader support for systemic change.

Johnston supports the March for Science as a key moment for defending evidence-based research and its role in shaping policy. He sees it as vital to stand up for science at a time when facts are under attack, especially in the context of climate change. The March for Science, in his view, is about protecting the integrity of research, ensuring that decisions are grounded in evidence, and affirming the value of scientific inquiry for society.

He acknowledges that these efforts are unfolding against a difficult backdrop that includes fake news, attacks on expertise, and cuts to scientific funding. These trends threaten to undermine informed decision-making just when it is most needed. Yet, even in the face of these challenges, Johnston expresses a sense of optimism. His optimism is rooted in the progress already made, the power of collective action, and the continued commitment of scientists, activists, and citizens who refuse to give up on a safer, fairer future.

For Johnston, the path forward is clear: confront denial, reject false solutions, defend science, and take action now – both personally and collectively – to limit the damage of climate change and protect the living world on which we all depend.
