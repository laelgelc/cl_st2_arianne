For Roland Hipp, Managing Director of Greenpeace Germany, the end of nuclear power in Germany is not just an energy policy milestone – it is a people-powered victory decades in the making.

He traces this achievement back through a long history of public resistance to nuclear projects: from protests against reprocessing plants and nuclear waste transports to campaigns against the construction of new reactors. Along the way, there were key turning points that helped shift the country onto a different path.

One of the most important early successes was the halt of the planned reprocessing plant in Wackersdorf in 1989. Years of persistent protests played a decisive role in stopping that project, sending a clear signal that nuclear expansion would not go unchallenged.

Another major victory came in 2005, when nuclear waste shipments from Germany to the reprocessing plants at Sellafield in the UK and La Hague in France were banned. Greenpeace investigations had revealed high levels of radiation in the surrounding areas, and these findings helped to expose the dangers associated with the nuclear fuel cycle and build pressure for an end to such transports.

Hipp also points to the rejection of Gorleben as a nuclear waste repository as a crucial success. Gorleben was long at the center of controversy, and in his view it was ultimately recognized as unsuitable. Its rejection underscores a broader problem that remains unresolved worldwide: there is still no safe, permanent repository for highly radioactive nuclear waste anywhere on the planet.

In making the case against nuclear power, Hipp recalls the catastrophic accidents in Chernobyl and Fukushima as stark reminders of the technology’s inherent risks. He also warns about strategic vulnerabilities, noting that nuclear power creates dependency on uranium supplies, including from Russia.

For him, these experiences and dangers add up to a clear conclusion: nuclear power cannot offer a secure or sustainable energy future. Instead, he calls for a decisive shift toward renewable energy as the path to a genuinely safe and reliable energy system for the years ahead.
