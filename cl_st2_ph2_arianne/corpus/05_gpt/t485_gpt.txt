Air pollution from burning fossil fuels is damaging our health and driving the climate emergency at the same time. A new study estimates that this toxic air is responsible for 4.5 million deaths every year around the world. Behind that number are people whose lives are cut short or made harder by strokes, heart disease, lung cancer, asthma and other illnesses linked to dirty air.

These are not abstract risks. The fumes from petrol and diesel cars, and the pollution from coal power stations and other fossil fuel burning, are entering the air we all breathe. The result is a global health crisis layered on top of the climate crisis, with the same root cause: our dependence on fossil fuels.

People are standing up to this injustice. In early 2020, protests demanding clean air and climate action took place in countries including Thailand, Romania, Bulgaria, Senegal, South Africa, India, Turkey, Cameroon, Indonesia, and Kenya. Images from these mobilisations show communities coming together to demand their right to breathe safely and to live on a stable planet. From busy city streets to local neighbourhoods, the message was clear: fossil fuel pollution must end.

The solutions are already known. Ending the sale of new petrol and diesel cars is essential to cutting toxic exhaust fumes. Phasing out coal power stations will reduce deadly air pollution and slash climate-wrecking emissions at the same time. These steps are critical to protect people’s health and to confront the climate emergency.

But political will often lags behind what science and justice demand. That is why public pressure matters. Around the world, people are raising their voices to hold polluters accountable and to push governments to act faster and more boldly.

You can add your voice by signing the petition calling for #CleanAirNow. It is a call to end the age of fossil fuel pollution, to protect our health, and to make sure those responsible for this crisis are finally held to account.
