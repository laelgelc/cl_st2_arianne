Hope is not a feeling we wait for; it’s a resource we protect and renew together. For more than half a century, hope has powered people across the world to stand up to some of the most powerful industries on Earth – and win. That living history matters now more than ever, as climate impacts intensify and the temptation to give in to despair grows stronger.

For over 50 years, Greenpeace, together with millions of supporters and allies, has helped turn what once seemed impossible into reality: stopping nuclear tests, saving whales from industrial slaughter, and pushing destructive industries and governments to change course. These victories weren’t accidents or miracles. They were the result of people refusing to accept that “nothing can be done” – and proving, again and again, that collective action works.

That same determination is still reshaping the world today. In 2023, governments agreed the Global Ocean Treaty, a landmark step toward creating a network of marine sanctuaries on the high seas. This agreement opens the door to protecting vast areas of our shared ocean from destructive exploitation, defending biodiversity and giving marine life a chance to recover.

At the same time, governments are negotiating a Global Plastics Treaty. Around the world, communities have seen how plastic pollution chokes rivers, oceans, and neighborhoods, and how fossil fuel companies drive this crisis by expanding plastic production. The treaty negotiations exist because people organised, demanded change, and refused to let the plastics and fossil industries write the future alone.

Fossil fuel companies have tried to silence that kind of resistance. Greenpeace has faced lawsuits from powerful corporations, including Shell, aimed at shutting down peaceful protest and criticism. But courts have dismissed cases against Greenpeace, affirming that people and organisations have the right to speak out and mobilise for a livable planet. Every time these attempts to intimidate activists fail, it sends a clear message: public participation and dissent are not crimes – they are essential to democracy and to climate justice.

On the frontlines of extraction, Indigenous Peoples and local communities continue to defend their lands and waters, often at great personal risk. Their resistance has delayed or disrupted fossil fuel projects, buying precious time and protecting ecosystems. These struggles are not symbolic. They are concrete barriers slowing the expansion of coal, oil, and gas, and they remind the world that there are real alternatives to a future dominated by fossil fuels.

Those alternatives are not theoretical. The International Energy Agency has laid out pathways to keep global heating to 1.5°C that rely on rapidly scaling up renewable energy. Solar and wind power have become cheaper, transforming the economics of the energy system. What was once dismissed as unrealistic is now outcompeting fossil fuels in many places, making a fast transition both possible and increasingly inevitable.

Money is beginning to move, too. Financial institutions and investors are shifting away from fossil fuels, responding to both the climate crisis and the growing economic risks of backing coal, oil, and gas. While this shift is far from complete, it shows that pressure from people, movements, and science is changing how capital flows – and therefore what kind of future gets built.

The world’s top climate scientists have also been clear. The IPCC confirms that there is still time to reduce emissions enough to avoid the worst climate impacts. The window is narrow and closing fast, but it is open. That means our choices now – the policies we demand, the projects we stop, the solutions we scale up – still matter enormously.

None of this erases the reality of the climate crisis. Fires, floods, heatwaves, and storms are already devastating lives and livelihoods. Many people feel overwhelmed, angry, or numb as they watch disasters multiply and leaders fail to act at the speed and scale required. Despair is an understandable reaction to a world on fire.

But despair is exactly what the fossil fuel industry and its allies are counting on. If people believe nothing can change, they stop trying to change it – and the status quo rolls on. Hope, in contrast, is not naive optimism or a refusal to look at the facts. It is the decision to face those facts and act anyway, together.

Hope grows when we remember what people have already achieved: treaties to protect the oceans, global negotiations to tackle plastic pollution, legal victories against corporate intimidation, Indigenous resistance slowing fossil expansion, the rapid rise of clean energy, financial shifts away from coal, oil, and gas, and scientific confirmation that our actions still count. Each of these is a reminder that the future is not fixed.

Protecting hope means refusing to see ourselves as powerless spectators. It means joining others – in communities, workplaces, schools, and movements – to demand systemic change: phasing out fossil fuels, expanding renewables, defending nature, and centering justice for those most affected by the crisis. It means standing with those on the frontlines, backing legal and political efforts to hold polluters to account, and pushing governments to turn treaties and targets into real-world action.

Hope is a vital natural resource. It is renewed every time someone chooses to organise instead of giving up, to support a campaign, to stand with a community resisting a new fossil project, or to push for ambitious climate policies. In this moment of overlapping crises, preserving and strengthening that resource is one of the most important things we can do.

The path ahead is hard, but it is not empty. It is lined with victories already won, tools already in our hands, and people already in motion. By acting together, we can keep hope alive – and use it to power the transformations our planet, and all of us who depend on it, urgently need.
