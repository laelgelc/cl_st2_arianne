In the Usinsk region of Russia, seismic surveys and oil exploration have left a trail of disruption and fear across local communities and their lands. Residents describe how once-clear waters have turned muddy and polluted, forests have been cut back, and the fish and wildlife they relied on are disappearing. The very ground beneath their homes shakes from explosions linked to industrial activity.

People living in nearby villages speak of brooks that have become cloudy and dirty, especially where roads and other infrastructure have been pushed through previously untouched areas. Paths once used for berry-picking and hunting are being destroyed, cutting off vital sources of food and income. These are not just recreational activities but essential parts of local livelihoods and culture, now threatened by expanding oil operations.

Memories of past disasters remain vivid. The 1994 oil spill that contaminated the Pechora River is still a reference point for the dangers of this industry. Locals recall the health risks and the long-lasting damage to the river and surrounding environment, and they worry that history could repeat itself. The prospect of new spills or accidents deepens their anxiety about current and future projects.

Lukoil-Komi’s operations are at the center of these concerns. Villagers accuse the company of acting carelessly and ignoring the consequences of its work on land, water, and people. They report explosions that rattle their houses and industrial activity that advances with little regard for the ecosystems in its path. In response, residents are speaking out, organizing protests, and demanding that their voices be heard.

For those who live in the Usinsk region, the land is worth far more than the oil beneath it. It provides food, clean water, and a way of life that has sustained communities for generations. As seismic surveys and oil exploration intensify, locals are insisting that their forests, rivers, and traditional livelihoods must not be sacrificed for short-term extraction. Their message is clear: the value of a healthy environment and a secure future outweighs the profits of the oil industry.
