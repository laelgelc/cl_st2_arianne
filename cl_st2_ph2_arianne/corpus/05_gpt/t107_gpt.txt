Across Europe, a quiet revolution in how we move is underway. From national rail networks to city tram lines, more and more governments are rolling out affordable “climate tickets” for public transport. These passes are designed to tackle several crises at once: rising fuel prices, energy insecurity, and the climate emergency. Where they’ve been introduced, they are proving popular, easing pressure on household budgets and offering a fairer, cleaner alternative to car dependency.

The basic idea behind climate tickets is simple: make public transport so affordable and straightforward that it becomes the obvious choice for everyday journeys. In many places, this has meant flat-rate passes valid across large regions or entire countries, rather than a confusing patchwork of fares and zones. The result is not only more predictable travel costs for people, but also clear climate benefits, as more journeys shift from private cars to buses, trams, and trains.

However, a Greenpeace assessment of 30 different ticketing systems across Europe highlights that access to these benefits is far from equal. The report finds major inconsistencies in both affordability and simplicity. Some countries and cities offer generous discounts or easy-to-understand passes, while others still rely on complex, fragmented systems that can be hard to navigate, especially for those who need support the most.

Discounts for vulnerable groups are particularly uneven. In some places, people with disabilities, those on low incomes, older people, and refugees can access reduced fares or special passes. Elsewhere, support is limited, difficult to claim, or missing altogether. This patchwork approach means that your ability to travel affordably and sustainably can depend heavily on where you live, your legal status, or how easily you can navigate bureaucracy.

Despite these gaps, the experience of several countries shows what is possible. Germany, Spain, Austria and others have introduced climate-oriented ticket schemes that have encouraged people to leave their cars at home more often. These initiatives have contributed to reduced car use and lower emissions, while also making everyday mobility more affordable for many households. They offer concrete proof that when public transport is made cheap, simple, and widely available, people respond.

A common concern raised by policymakers is how to pay for such ambitious ticketing schemes. Yet the solutions are already on the table. Public transport could be funded more fairly by redirecting the vast subsidies currently flowing to fossil fuels, or by introducing windfall taxes on the excess profits of energy and fossil fuel companies. Instead of propping up polluting industries, public money and extraordinary corporate gains could support clean, accessible mobility for everyone.

At the European level, there is still no ideal climate ticket that is inclusive, easy to use, and valid across borders. The current patchwork makes cross-border train and bus travel more complicated and often more expensive than it needs to be, undermining the potential of rail and coach networks as a climate-friendly alternative to flying and driving.

The successes seen so far have prompted growing calls for an EU-wide approach. Advocates are urging European institutions and national governments to work together on a climate ticket that guarantees affordable, simple, and sustainable mobility across the continent. Such a ticket would need to be designed with equity at its core, ensuring that people with the least resources and those in vulnerable situations can benefit fully.

The emerging evidence from national and local schemes shows that climate tickets can cut emissions, reduce car use, and ease the burden of transport costs on households. With fair funding mechanisms available and clear public demand, the next step is to turn scattered national experiments into a coherent European vision—one where clean, affordable mobility is a right, not a privilege, and where choosing public transport is the easiest choice for people and the planet alike.
