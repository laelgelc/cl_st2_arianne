Beneath the waves off Brazil’s coast lies the Amazon Reef, a unique and little-known ecosystem that flourishes where the Amazon River meets the Atlantic Ocean. On the other side of the globe, along Australia’s southern coastline, the Great Southern Reef stretches across cold, nutrient-rich waters. Though separated by vast distances and different climates, these two underwater worlds share something powerful in common: they are both vibrant, life-filled refuges for marine species, and they are both under threat from the fossil fuel industry.

The Amazon Reef is home to remarkable biodiversity, including pink dolphins that navigate its murky, life-rich waters. The Great Southern Reef, meanwhile, shelters extraordinary creatures like leafy sea dragons, as well as whales and sea lions that depend on its complex habitats for food and shelter. These reefs are not only beautiful; they are vital ecosystems that support intricate food webs and coastal communities.

Yet oil companies see these same regions as extraction frontiers. Off Brazil, the oil giant Total sought to drill near the Amazon Reef. That plan faced strong resistance and intense scrutiny, and Total was ultimately denied a drilling license in the area. In Australia’s Great Australian Bight, which overlaps with parts of the Great Southern Reef region, Equinor pushed to open up deepwater oil drilling. Those plans were delayed in the face of widespread community opposition and mounting concern over the environmental risks, including the possibility of devastating oil spills that could spread across vast stretches of ocean and coastline.

These outcomes did not happen by accident. They are the result of organised, determined campaigning by people who refuse to accept that irreplaceable ocean ecosystems should be sacrificed for short-term fossil fuel profits. Greenpeace has worked alongside global ocean defenders, scientists, and coastal communities to shine a light on the Amazon Reef and the Great Southern Reef, exposing the dangers of drilling and amplifying the voices of those who depend on healthy seas.

Scientists have helped reveal just how special and fragile these reefs are, providing evidence of the species they support and the risks posed by industrial activity. Local communities, from fishers to tourism operators, have spoken out about what they stand to lose if an oil spill were to hit their shores. Together, they have built powerful, people-driven movements that have already forced some of the world’s biggest oil companies to pull back.

The fight is far from over. The fossil fuel industry continues to seek access to new offshore areas, even as the climate crisis deepens and the need for a rapid shift to clean, renewable energy becomes ever more urgent. Protecting the Amazon Reef and the Great Southern Reef is not just about saving individual species like pink dolphins, leafy sea dragons, whales, and sea lions. It is about choosing a future powered by clean energy instead of locking our oceans into ever-expanding fossil fuel extraction.

Every person who joins this movement strengthens the push for change. By standing with frontline communities, supporting independent science, and backing campaigns that challenge oil expansion, people around the world can help keep these unique reefs safe from drilling. The same global solidarity that helped stop Total’s plans near the Amazon Reef and delayed Equinor’s ambitions in the Great Australian Bight can be harnessed again and again to protect our oceans.

The Amazon Reef and the Great Southern Reef may be thousands of kilometres apart, but their stories are intertwined. Both show that when people come together to defend what they love, they can push back against powerful interests and open the way for a cleaner, safer energy future. Readers are invited to join this growing movement to safeguard these extraordinary marine ecosystems from fossil fuels and to help accelerate the transition to clean energy that our planet’s oceans—and all of us—urgently need.
