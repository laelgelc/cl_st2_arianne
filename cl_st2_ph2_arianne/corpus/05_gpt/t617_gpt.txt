Imagine walking into your kitchen and finding the sink overflowing. Water is pouring onto the floor, running under the cupboards, soaking into everything. You grab towels, a mop, maybe even a bucket—but if you don’t turn off the tap, the water keeps coming. No matter how hard you clean, the flood continues.

That’s exactly how plastic pollution works.

For decades, governments, companies, and the public have been told that if we just recycle more, clean more beaches, and pick up more litter, we can solve the plastic crisis. But the plastic tap is still on full blast. The corporations that produce vast amounts of single-use plastic keep increasing production, and the result is a world drowning in plastic waste.

Nestlé is one of those corporations. Last year, Nestlé produced 1.7 million tonnes of plastic packaging—a 13% increase. While communities, activists, and scientists are calling for less plastic, Nestlé is pumping out more. It’s like watching someone turn the tap higher while the sink spills over and the floor disappears under water.

Plastic doesn’t start out as an innocent material. Its origins are toxic. From the moment it’s produced, plastic is linked to pollution and harm. It sheds tiny particles, breaks down into microplastics, and travels through our environment. These particles end up in our food, our water, and ultimately our bodies.

Once inside us, plastic and the chemicals associated with it pose serious health risks. The plastic crisis is not just about oceans and beaches—it’s about our health, our families, and our communities. Every stage of plastic’s life cycle, from production to disposal, carries danger.

That’s why simply swapping one kind of disposable packaging for another is not a solution. Nestlé cannot claim progress by replacing plastic with paper or bioplastics. These materials still carry environmental costs and keep us locked into a throwaway system. They don’t turn off the tap—they just change the colour of the water.

The real solution is to reduce single-use packaging altogether and build systems that prioritize refill and reuse. Nestlé has the global reach, resources, and influence to help lead this shift. Instead of expanding single-use packaging, the company must commit to cutting it and investing in refill and reuse systems that work at scale.

This is not a distant or abstract demand. Greenpeace activists recently took that call directly to Nestlé’s Annual General Meeting. Inside the AGM, Greenpeace International Executive Director Jennifer Morgan confronted Nestlé’s leadership, challenging the company’s role in driving the plastic crisis.

She pointed to the reality that Nestlé’s products are polluting oceans, harming wildlife, and impacting communities around the world. This isn’t speculation—it’s been documented. A global brand audit by Break Free From Plastic identified Nestlé as a major contributor to plastic pollution, with its packaging found scattered across coastlines, rivers, and neighborhoods.

Communities on the frontlines of plastic pollution are already living with the consequences. Wildlife is entangled, poisoned, and killed by plastic debris. People are exposed to plastic and its chemicals through the air they breathe, the food they eat, and the water they drink. Meanwhile, companies like Nestlé keep turning up the tap.

The overflowing sink analogy makes the situation painfully clear. We cannot mop our way out of this crisis while corporations increase plastic production. Cleanup efforts and recycling are like towels on the floor—they might slow the damage in the short term, but they don’t stop the flood.

To truly tackle plastic pollution, Nestlé must turn off the tap. That means:

- Reducing single-use plastic packaging instead of increasing it.
- Rejecting false solutions like paper or bioplastics that keep the throwaway model alive.
- Committing to refill and reuse systems that cut waste at the source.

Nestlé has a choice: continue to be part of the problem, or help lead the world toward a future free from single-use plastic. The sink is overflowing. It’s time to reach for the tap.
