Across the world, communities are standing up to the oil industry and demanding real action on the climate emergency. Greenpeace is part of this global movement, working alongside Indigenous Peoples, local groups, and millions of supporters to stop new fossil fuel projects and accelerate a just transition to clean energy.

In Australia, Greenpeace campaigns to protect the Great Australian Bight from Equinor’s plans to drill for oil. This unique and fragile marine environment faces serious risk from offshore drilling, and people across the country are mobilising to keep it safe from spills and industrial development.

In Brazil and French Guiana, efforts are focused on defending the Amazon Reef from BP. This little-known but vital ecosystem is threatened by oil exploration, and Greenpeace works with local allies to keep drilling away from the region’s waters.

In Germany, Greenpeace challenges the dominance of internal combustion engines. By confronting carmakers and policymakers, campaigns there push for cleaner transport systems and an end to the fossil-fuelled vehicles driving the climate crisis.

In Russia, Greenpeace supports Indigenous opposition to oil giant Surgutneftegas. Indigenous communities are on the front lines of extraction and pollution, and their resistance is central to protecting lands, waters, and ways of life from the impacts of drilling.

In Canada, Greenpeace is part of the fight against tar sands pipelines. These massive projects lock in some of the most carbon-intensive oil on the planet, and communities across the country are resisting expansions that threaten the climate, rivers, and Indigenous territories.

In New Zealand, Greenpeace opposes OMV’s oil and gas permits. Offshore drilling in these waters risks spills and further fossil fuel dependence, and people are coming together to demand an end to new exploration.

In Norway, Greenpeace challenges Arctic drilling through the courts. Legal action targets the government’s licensing of oil operations in this vulnerable region, pushing for protection of the Arctic and alignment with climate commitments.

In the UK, Greenpeace has taken direct action to block BP oil rigs. By physically preventing rigs from reaching their drilling sites, activists highlight the contradiction between oil expansion and the urgent need to cut emissions.

In the Philippines, Greenpeace helps blockade Shell operations and pursues investigations into fossil fuel accountability. These efforts aim to hold major oil companies responsible for their role in the climate crisis and its impacts on vulnerable communities.

In the United States, Greenpeace pushes for a Green New Deal and works to halt fossil fuel expansion. Campaigns there support ambitious climate policy, while resisting new oil infrastructure that would deepen dependence on fossil fuels.

Across all these struggles, a common thread runs through: millions of people are uniting to demand an end to the age of oil and a rapid, fair transition to clean energy. From courtrooms to coastlines, from city streets to remote communities, this global movement is challenging the power of the fossil fuel industry and calling for a livable future for all.
