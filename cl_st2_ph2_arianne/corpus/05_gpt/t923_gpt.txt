Valencia has made a bold and inspiring commitment: to more than double its organic farming land from 8% to 20% by 2020, backed by an investment of 23 million Euros. This decision stands out even more given Spain’s ongoing economic crisis and the country’s high pesticide use, which is harming bees and putting vital pollinators at risk.

At the same time, demand for ecological food is growing around the world. More and more people want food that is healthier for themselves and the planet, and this shift in demand is encouraging farmers to move away from industrial systems and towards ecological agriculture. In and around Valencia, and far beyond, a vibrant movement is taking shape: local markets, food co-ops, and other community-based initiatives are flourishing as people seek out sustainable, pesticide-free food.

This is about much more than consumer choice. Ecological agriculture offers real solutions to some of the most pressing crises we face today, including climate change, pollution, biodiversity loss, and hunger. By investing in ecological farming, governments can help transform our food systems into ones that protect ecosystems, support farmers, and provide healthy food for everyone.

Valencia’s decision shows what is possible when political will meets public demand. It is a clear signal that shifting public money towards ecological agriculture is both necessary and achievable, even in difficult economic times. But this cannot be left to one region alone. Governments everywhere need to follow this example and invest in ecological farming as a cornerstone of their response to the climate and biodiversity emergencies.

Individuals also have a powerful role to play. By choosing ecological food where possible, supporting local organic markets and co-ops, and speaking up for better food policies, each of us can help strengthen this movement. The call now is to pledge support for better food: food that nourishes people, respects animals, protects bees and other pollinators, and restores the ecosystems we all depend on.

Valencia has taken an important step. The task ahead is to ensure that this kind of commitment becomes the norm, not the exception, and that together we build food systems that are truly sustainable, fair, and resilient.
