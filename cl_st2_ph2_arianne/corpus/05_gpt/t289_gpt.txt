Activists from Greenpeace Spain recently brought a striking symbol to Barcelona-El Prat airport: a 12-meter-long train model installed right in front of the terminals. The message was simple and direct—our transport system is heading in the wrong direction, and we need to switch tracks.

The protest focused on the airline sector’s climate impact and the planned expansion of Barcelona-El Prat airport. That expansion would not only increase air traffic and emissions, but also damage nearby wetlands and come at a cost of 1.7 million euros. For Greenpeace Spain, this is a clear example of public money being used to deepen the climate crisis and destroy valuable ecosystems instead of supporting cleaner, fairer alternatives.

The action highlighted a wider European problem: poor rail connectivity that pushes people towards polluting planes and cars. Instead of pouring resources into more runways and terminals, Greenpeace is calling for serious investment in trains that are accessible, affordable, and well-connected across borders.

The protest also criticized a model of low-cost tourism that depends on cheap flights and high volumes of visitors, with heavy environmental and social impacts. To shift towards a fair and sustainable mobility system, Greenpeace is demanding:

- The creation of 30 new cross-border rail connections by 2025.  
- Better technical compatibility between national rail systems so that international journeys become simpler and more reliable.  
- Easier access for bikes and pets on trains, making rail a practical option for more people and more types of trips.  
- Cuts to subsidies for airlines, including measures like taxing kerosene, so that flying reflects its true environmental cost.  
- An end to short-haul flights on routes where there are viable train alternatives.

To support these demands, Greenpeace has launched a petition and produced a video that explain why Europe must stop expanding airports and start prioritizing rail. The train at Barcelona-El Prat is a reminder that another way of travelling is possible—if decision-makers choose to invest in it.
