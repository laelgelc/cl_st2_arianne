Mr. Mindbomb traces the life of Robert Lorne Hunter, from his early years and formative influences to his central role in the birth of Greenpeace and the global ecology movement. Edited by his wife, Bobbi Hunter, the book is built from the memories and reflections of friends, family, and colleagues who knew him across different chapters of his life.

The biography follows Hunter’s path into journalism, showing how his work as a reporter sharpened both his writing and his sense of responsibility to expose injustice. Pacifist ideas shaped his worldview, and those influences became crucial as he helped transform opposition to environmental destruction into strategic, non-violent direct action.

A major focus of the book is Hunter’s role in the formation of Greenpeace and the development of “mindbomb” tactics—powerful, symbolic actions designed to capture the world’s attention and shift public consciousness. Contributors describe how these tactics were used in campaigns against nuclear testing and whaling, turning distant or hidden environmental crises into urgent global stories.

Throughout the accounts, a consistent picture of Hunter emerges: humble, often funny, and deeply committed to inspiring others to act. Those who worked with him recall how his creativity and courage helped spark global ecology actions and shaped the identity of Greenpeace in its early years.

Mr. Mindbomb also follows Hunter beyond his time with Greenpeace, into his later work as an ecology reporter. In that role, he continued to communicate the realities of environmental crisis to a wide audience, using journalism to connect complex ecological issues with everyday life.

The book highlights his enduring legacy through his writing, including works like 2030: Thermageddon, which carried his warnings and hopes into future debates on the planet’s fate. Family reflections in the biography bring an intimate perspective to his final years, his passing in 2005, and the spirit of positive change he left behind. They portray not only a public figure and movement co-founder, but a partner, parent, and friend whose belief in a better world continues to resonate in the struggles for peace and ecology today.
