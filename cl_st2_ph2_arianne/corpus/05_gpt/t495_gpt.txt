Dorothy Metcalfe, who passed away on December 10, leaves behind a legacy woven into the earliest days of Greenpeace and the global movement against nuclear testing. A seasoned journalist and committed peace activist, she helped shape the organization’s voice at a time when a handful of determined people were trying to confront some of the most powerful governments in the world.

During the 1971–1972 campaigns against U.S. and French nuclear tests at Amchitka and Moruroa, Dorothy managed radio communications and media outreach, ensuring that the story of these dangerous tests reached far beyond the remote locations where they were being conducted. Her work helped bring international attention to nuclear testing in the Pacific, turning what might have been obscure military operations into a matter of public concern and global scrutiny.

Dorothy’s efforts were not limited to technical communications. She used her skills and experience as a journalist to pressure political leaders directly, including Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, and helped arrange an audience with Pope Paul VI. These interventions underscored how moral pressure and public visibility could be used together to challenge nuclear powers.

Working closely with her husband, Ben Metcalfe, Dorothy also demonstrated how setbacks could be transformed into opportunities. When French authorities deported them during the Moruroa campaign, the couple helped turn that act into a publicity coup, drawing even more media attention to French nuclear testing and the risks it posed.

Born in 1931 in Winnipeg, Dorothy became a dedicated peace activist and one of the people who helped launch Greenpeace through innovative tactics that were striking for their time: bold billboards, boat protests, and creative public actions that captured imaginations and headlines alike. These early strategies helped define the organization’s identity and showed how ordinary people could confront environmental and peace issues with courage and ingenuity.

A Celebration of Life for Dorothy Metcalfe is scheduled for February 18 in West Vancouver, where friends, family, and those inspired by her work will honour her contributions to peace, environmental protection, and the founding story of Greenpeace.
