Just a year ago, millions of us were filling streets and public squares, marching shoulder to shoulder for climate justice. The images of 2019’s huge climate marches are still vivid: hand-painted banners, chants echoing through city centers, and a powerful sense of shared purpose.

Now, a global pandemic has changed how we move, work, and gather. Physical distancing has emptied streets that once overflowed with people demanding climate action. But while our bodies may be apart, our voices have not gone quiet. Around the world, activists are finding creative, powerful ways to keep up the pressure for a safe climate and a just future.

Instead of mass rallies, climate strikes have moved online. Fridays For Future and other youth-led movements have helped popularize hashtags like #DigitalStrike, turning social media feeds into virtual protest lines. Photos of hand-made signs, screenshots of online gatherings, and coordinated posting days are creating a new kind of visibility—one that doesn’t rely on being physically together, yet still shows the breadth and determination of the movement.

Activists are also experimenting with virtual and holographic marches, projecting crowds where real ones can’t safely gather. Distanced physical protests, where people stand or sit far apart from one another, have appeared in some places, carefully respecting health guidelines while still occupying public space. Symbols of solidarity are popping up across social media profiles, timelines, and video calls, reminding decision-makers that the demand for climate justice has not gone away.

Even our homes have become platforms for protest. People are using light, shadows, and projectors to cast messages and banners onto buildings and walls, turning windows and balconies into mini-billboards for the planet. These actions may look different from the marches of 2019, but they are driven by the same urgency and hope.

All of these examples show that isolation does not mean silence. The climate movement is adapting, innovating, and holding onto the conviction that another world is possible. As societies rethink what “normal” looks like in the wake of COVID-19, we have a chance to turn this crisis into an opportunity: to push for a recovery that works for people and the planet, and to build a post-COVID future that is fairer, cleaner, and more resilient than what came before.
