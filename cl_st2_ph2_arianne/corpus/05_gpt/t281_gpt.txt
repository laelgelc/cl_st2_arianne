From Turkey’s coastal hills to the forests of Greece, from Russia’s vast taiga to the Amazon in Brazil, from the western United States and Canada to Italy and Lebanon, wildfires are raging with frightening intensity. These are not isolated disasters. They are connected by a common thread: a rapidly heating planet, driven by the continued burning of coal, oil and gas.

Extreme heat and prolonged drought are creating tinderbox conditions across continents. When forests are this dry, a spark – whether from lightning, power lines, or deliberate burning – can turn into a fast‑moving inferno. These fires devour homes and habitats, push communities to evacuate, and leave behind charred landscapes where rich, living ecosystems once stood.

Forests are among our most important allies in the fight against climate breakdown. They store vast amounts of carbon, shelter countless species, and regulate local and regional climates. When they burn, that stored carbon is released back into the atmosphere as greenhouse gases. What should be a carbon sink becomes a carbon source, feeding the very crisis that made the fires more likely and more intense in the first place.

The impacts extend far beyond the fire zones themselves. Smoke plumes from massive blazes in places like the US and Canada have traveled thousands of kilometers, turning skies hazy and degrading air quality in distant cities. People already vulnerable because of the COVID‑19 pandemic are being forced to breathe polluted air that can worsen respiratory and cardiovascular problems, placing additional strain on public health systems.

In Brazil, the situation is compounded by deliberate destruction. Under President Bolsonaro, illegal fires in the Amazon have continued, often set to clear land for agriculture and other commercial interests. These are not natural disasters but the result of political choices that undermine environmental protections and threaten Indigenous territories. Burning the Amazon – one of the world’s most important carbon stores and biodiversity hotspots – is a direct assault on climate stability and on the rights and safety of the peoples who have protected this forest for generations.

As the flames spread across so many regions, the scientific warning lights are flashing red. The latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) underscores the central role of fossil fuels in driving more frequent and more extreme weather events. Heatwaves, droughts and the resulting wildfires are not random anomalies; they are symptoms of an energy system still dominated by coal, oil and gas.

This is why Greenpeace is calling for urgent, systemic change. Phasing out fossil fuels is not a distant aspiration – it is an immediate necessity. Governments must stop pouring public money into coal, oil and gas through subsidies and tax breaks, and instead support a rapid, just transition to renewable energy and energy efficiency.

Protecting and restoring forests is equally vital. That means ending deforestation and destructive burning, enforcing environmental laws, and recognizing and upholding the land rights of Indigenous Peoples and local communities. Their knowledge and leadership are essential for safeguarding ecosystems and building resilience to climate impacts.

The fires tearing through Turkey, Greece, Russia, Brazil, the US, Canada, Italy and Lebanon are a stark reminder that climate change is here, now, and deadly. Every fraction of a degree of warming we prevent will help reduce the intensity and frequency of these disasters. Every forest we protect keeps more carbon out of the atmosphere and more life on the land.

The world faces a clear choice. We can continue down a path of fossil fuel dependence, escalating fires and deepening crises, or we can act with the urgency that science and justice demand: ending fossil fuel expansion, stopping subsidies, protecting forests with Indigenous guidance, and committing to real climate action that puts people and the planet first.
