G-Star’s decision to eliminate hazardous chemicals from its supply chain and products by 2020 marks a significant step forward for cleaner fashion. By joining the Greenpeace Detox movement, G-Star becomes the 15th global corporation to commit to this ambitious goal, alongside brands such as Uniqlo, Benetton, and Victoria’s Secret.

This new commitment is a clear improvement on G-Star’s earlier, weaker pledge. It now includes concrete dates for phasing out hazardous substances, a stronger promise of transparency, and forthcoming case studies that will show how toxic chemicals can be substituted with safer alternatives. These elements are crucial for turning promises into real change on the ground.

For years, the fashion industry has contributed to the pollution of rivers and waterways through the use and discharge of hazardous chemicals. Some brands have tried to respond to public concern with vague or loophole-filled promises that amount to little more than greenwashing. In contrast, strong Detox commitments set a clear path towards eliminating toxic substances from production and protecting communities and ecosystems.

Public pressure has played a decisive role in this shift. Campaigning and consumer demand have helped transform both G-Star and Levi’s from brands associated with greenwashing into leaders in the Detox movement. Their progress shows that when people speak out, major companies can be pushed to take meaningful action.

But this is only part of the change the fashion sector needs. Many influential brands still have not committed to eliminating hazardous chemicals. Greenpeace is calling on people everywhere to keep up the pressure by sharing the “Detox Fashion” video and using their voices to demand stronger action from companies like GAP and Calvin Klein.

Every new Detox commitment helps move the industry away from toxic pollution and towards a future where fashion no longer costs the earth. Public engagement remains essential to ensure more brands follow G-Star’s lead and adopt credible, transparent plans to phase out hazardous chemicals.
