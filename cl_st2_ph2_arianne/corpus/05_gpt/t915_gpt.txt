Greenpeace is working towards a toxic-free future by challenging the use of chemicals that persist in the environment, build up in living organisms, and are linked to cancer and hormone disruption. The goal is to eliminate these substances from products and production processes, and to help drive a shift towards safer alternatives and more transparent supply chains.

There are already encouraging signs of change. In some sectors, companies are beginning to disclose more information about the chemicals they use. Regulatory frameworks like the EU’s REACH regulation are putting pressure on industry to phase out the most hazardous substances. Certain industries have started to substitute the worst chemicals with safer options. Yet, the current pace of change remains too slow compared to the scale of the problem, and much faster action is needed.

To strengthen and refocus its Detox work, Greenpeace commissioned a two-year research project by the Science Unit at Exeter University. This research reassessed the existing Detox strategy and examined how to accelerate the phase-out of hazardous chemicals in key sectors where everyday exposure is significant: electronics, toys, cosmetics, household products, and textiles.

The study concentrated on six priority groups of chemicals that are widely used and of major concern: perfluorinated compounds (PFCs), phthalates, heavy metals, bisphenol A (BPA), brominated flame retardants (BFRs), and alkylphenols/alkylphenol ethoxylates (APs/APEs). These groups are associated with persistence, toxicity, bioaccumulation, and disruptive effects on human and environmental health.

As part of this work, researchers compiled a list of more than 17,000 chemicals with potential hazardous properties. They also examined how chemicals move through global supply chains, from production to final products. This analysis revealed that toxic pollution is widespread and deeply embedded in the way goods are currently designed, manufactured, and sold. A major factor behind this pollution is the lack of transparency and information: companies often do not know, or do not disclose, which chemicals are used at different stages of their supply chains.

By making this research openly available, Greenpeace aims to support a much broader detoxification effort. The findings are intended to help regulators, companies, scientists, and civil society better understand where the biggest chemical risks lie, and how to prioritize action. Open access to this information can help drive more ambitious policies, encourage safer product design, and support the rapid phase-out of hazardous substances across the sectors that touch people’s lives every day.
