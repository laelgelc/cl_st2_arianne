After years of tireless campaigning, something extraordinary has happened at the end of the Earth: the Ross Sea in Antarctica has become the world’s largest marine protected area.

Covering an immense 1,550,000 km², this new sanctuary is a huge win for penguins, whales, seals, fish, and the countless other species that depend on these icy waters. Most of this vast area will be fully protected from human exploitation for the next 35 years, giving wildlife the space and time it needs to recover and thrive.

This victory did not come easily. It follows years of pressure on governments at the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), where Greenpeace and allies have campaigned relentlessly for strong protection in the Southern Ocean. The outcome in the Ross Sea shows what is possible when scientists, environmental organizations, and millions of people around the world stand together and refuse to give up.

It also comes amid a wave of new protections in other parts of the ocean. Recent expansions in Papahānaumokuākea and the creation of new marine monuments have added millions more square kilometres to the global network of protected areas. Step by step, the world is beginning to recognise that safeguarding the oceans is essential for life on Earth.

But this is only the beginning of what’s needed. The Ross Sea sanctuary is a powerful example of what works, yet huge areas of the high seas remain unprotected and vulnerable to overfishing and industrial exploitation. To truly restore ocean health, we need a strong UN agreement that can create high seas sanctuaries far beyond national borders.

Scientists and conservation groups are calling for at least 40% of the world’s oceans to be protected by 2030. Achieving this would give marine life a real chance to recover, boost biodiversity, and help the oceans withstand the escalating impacts of climate change.

Fishing interests and other powerful industries will continue to push back against ambitious protection. That’s why public mobilization remains crucial. The Ross Sea victory was made possible by people around the world signing petitions, contacting decision-makers, spreading the word, and standing up for the oceans. The same determination is now needed to win strong protections on the high seas.

The new Ross Sea marine protected area is a beacon of hope in a time of environmental crisis. It shows that when we act together, we can secure historic wins for the planet. Now we must build on this momentum, demand bold action at the UN, and keep fighting until vast, connected sanctuaries span our blue planet—protecting the oceans, and all of us who depend on them, for generations to come.
