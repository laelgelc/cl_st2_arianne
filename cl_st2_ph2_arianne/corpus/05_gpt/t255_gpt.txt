Industrial agriculture is often sold as the only way to “feed the world,” but in reality, we already produce enough food for everyone. People go hungry not because of a lack of food, but because of poverty, inequality, and a food system that treats food primarily as a commodity for profit rather than a human right.

This profit-driven model shapes how land is used and who benefits from it. A huge share of agricultural land is devoted not to growing food for people, but to feeding livestock. Around 26% of the world’s land is used to produce feed for animals, locking us into a system that is both inefficient and deeply unfair. Instead of prioritising nutritious, accessible food for communities, land is channelled into supporting high-meat diets and industrial livestock operations that mainly serve those who can already afford them.

The environmental cost of this system is staggering. Industrial agriculture is responsible for about 19% of global greenhouse gas emissions, making it a major driver of the climate crisis. It is also linked to around 80% of global deforestation, as forests are cleared for cattle ranching and feed crops. These forests are critical for stabilising the climate, protecting biodiversity, and supporting Indigenous Peoples and local communities. Destroying them to expand industrial farming further undermines the resilience of people and ecosystems in a warming world.

At the same time, industrial agriculture is reshaping our diets and our health. Highly processed products and pesticide-intensive farming have become the norm, while organic and agroecological foods are often priced as luxury items, out of reach for many people. This is not an accident but a result of policies and markets that favour large agribusinesses and chemical-intensive production. Pesticides used in these systems have been linked to serious health problems, including diseases like cancer, putting farmworkers, nearby communities, and consumers at risk.

The myth that industrial agriculture is the only way to feed a growing population hides the reality that this system is driving climate breakdown, destroying forests, deepening inequality, and making people sick. A different path is not only possible, it is urgently necessary.

Transforming our food system starts with changing what and how we consume, and who we choose to support. Reducing meat consumption, especially from industrial livestock, can free up land, lower emissions, and reduce pressure on forests. Supporting Indigenous Peoples and small-scale farmers, who often protect biodiversity and steward their lands sustainably, helps shift power away from corporations and towards communities.

Halting deforestation must be a non-negotiable priority. That means ending the expansion of industrial agriculture into forests and other vital ecosystems, and respecting the rights of the people who live in and depend on these areas.

Finally, governments must stop allowing corporations to shape our food system in ways that maximise profit at the expense of people and the planet. We need strong rules that hold agribusinesses accountable for environmental damage, human rights abuses, and health harms, and policies that make healthy, sustainably produced food accessible to everyone.

By demanding that our leaders regulate corporations, protect forests, and support just, ecological farming, we can move towards a food system that nourishes people, respects nature, and helps stabilise the climate instead of driving it further into crisis.
