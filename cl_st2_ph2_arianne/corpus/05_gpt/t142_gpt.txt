In the early hours of June 28, 1969, Trans Women, Drag Queens, and sex workers at the Stonewall Inn in New York City refused to accept another night of police harassment and brutality. Among them were Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia Rivera, whose courage helped ignite days of resistance that would ripple across the world. What began as an uprising against violence and oppression became a catalyst for a global movement for Queer rights, self-determination, and dignity.

Pride Month exists because of that resistance. It is not just a party or a parade; it is a powerful reminder that non-heterosexual lives and loves have value, and that Queer people have always fought back against systems that try to erase or punish them. Pride is both a celebration and a protest, and both are still urgently needed. Today, 71 countries still criminalize same-sex sexual activity, meaning that for millions of Queer people, simply existing openly can lead to arrest, violence, or worse.

As a conservation worker, I see clearly how the struggle for Queer liberation is inseparable from the struggle for environmental and climate justice. Climate change does not affect everyone equally. Those already pushed to the margins—by homophobia, transphobia, racism, poverty, or colonialism—are often made even more vulnerable as the planet warms. When housing, healthcare, or legal protection are already precarious, climate disasters hit harder and recovery is more difficult. For Queer communities, especially in criminalizing or hostile countries, climate impacts compound existing risks.

Yet Queer people are not only vulnerable; they are powerful agents of change in the fight for a livable planet. Queer environmental activism has always existed, even if it is often overlooked or erased. Today, groups like Queers x Climate are making that work visible, insisting that the Queer movement and the climate movement stand together. Their message is clear: there is no social justice without environmental justice, and no environmental justice without social justice.

This means that Pride cannot be separated from the Earth beneath our feet, the air we breathe, and the water we depend on. The same systems that treat Queer lives as disposable often treat ecosystems and communities as expendable too. When we challenge those systems—whether we are defending a forest, a coastline, or a Queer community center—we are part of the same struggle for a world where all beings can live safely and freely.

Fifty-three years after Stonewall, Pride Month is a time to honor those who resisted first, those who risked everything so that others might live more openly. It is also a time to expand our understanding of what liberation means. It must include the right to live on a stable, thriving planet; the right to clean air and water; the right to safety in the face of floods, fires, and storms; and the right to be Queer, visible, and vocal in every space where decisions about our shared future are being made.

During Pride Month, we can carry the spirit of Stonewall into the climate struggle by uplifting Queer environmental groups, centering the voices of those most affected by climate breakdown, and insisting that every demand for climate action also be a demand for justice. To honor Marsha P. Johnson, Sylvia Rivera, and all those who rose up in 1969 is to keep resisting in their name—by standing for Queer rights, for communities on the frontlines of climate change, and for the living Earth that holds us all.
