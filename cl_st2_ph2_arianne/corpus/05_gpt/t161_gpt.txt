We are living through a great unravelling of life on Earth, driven not by necessity, but by greed and a model of endless exploitation. Forests, oceans, rivers and grasslands are being pushed to breaking point by an economic system that treats living beings as expendable and nature as a mine to be emptied. The tragedy is not only the loss of individual species, but the tearing apart of the intricate web that connects us all.

Nowhere is this more visible than in the oceans. Commercial fisheries kill millions of sharks every year, often as “bycatch” or for short-term profit. These apex predators are essential to healthy marine ecosystems, helping to keep populations in balance and habitats resilient. Their loss ripples through food webs, weakening coral reefs, degrading coastal protection and ultimately threatening the communities that depend on the sea for food and livelihoods. When we kill the guardians of the oceans at this scale, we are dismantling the very systems that sustain us.

On land, the picture is just as stark. Only around 9% of the world’s forests remain truly intact. Even the Amazon, often called the lungs of the planet, is now heavily degraded. Logging, agribusiness expansion and infrastructure development have carved through what once seemed like an endless green expanse. Forests are not simply carbon stores; they are homes to countless species, climate regulators, and cultural and spiritual landscapes for Indigenous Peoples and local communities. As these forests are fragmented and destroyed, species disappear, water cycles falter and the climate crisis accelerates.

The oceans, too, are under relentless pressure. Just 3% of the global ocean is currently free from significant human impacts. Industrial fishing, deep-sea mining prospects, shipping and pollution are reaching into almost every corner, including the high seas that were once thought too vast to be harmed. The idea that nature can absorb limitless extraction has been proven fatally wrong, yet the same patterns of exploitation continue.

Against this backdrop, the upcoming UN Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) COP15 in Kunming, China, is a pivotal moment. Governments will negotiate a new global framework for nature, with the power to either set us on a path towards recovery or lock in more destruction dressed up as progress. Central to these talks is the question of finance: who pays, how much, and under what conditions.

A proposed global biodiversity fund would start at US$100 billion per year and rise to US$700 billion annually. This level of funding reflects the scale of the crisis and the urgent need to support countries, especially in the Global South, to protect and restore ecosystems. China has also announced the Kunming Fund, pledging around US$230 million to support biodiversity protection in developing countries. These commitments, if delivered and expanded, could help shift us away from extractive models and towards genuine protection and restoration.

But money alone will not save nature if it flows into the wrong approaches. There is a growing push for so‑called “solutions” such as biodiversity offsets, which allow companies or governments to destroy nature in one place as long as they promise to “restore” or “protect” it somewhere else. These schemes often fail to deliver real, equivalent protection and can even legitimise further destruction. Treating ecosystems as interchangeable units on a balance sheet ignores their uniqueness, their cultural significance, and the complex relationships that have evolved over millennia. Offsets risk becoming a dangerous distraction from the hard work of stopping harm at its source.

Any credible biodiversity framework must instead be grounded in respect for Indigenous rights and leadership. Targets like protecting at least 30% of land and sea by 2030 (often called 30x30) cannot become a pretext for land grabs or “fortress conservation” that excludes the very communities who have protected nature most effectively. Evidence from places like Brazil and West Papua shows that where Indigenous Peoples have secure land rights and are supported rather than displaced, biodiversity flourishes. Their knowledge, governance systems and spiritual connections to territory are not optional add‑ons; they are central to living within the limits of the planet.

In the oceans, Greenpeace’s ocean blueprint offers a science‑based map of the marine sanctuaries needed to allow life to recover. These fully protected areas would create safe havens where industrial activity is off‑limits, giving marine species space to breed, feed and migrate undisturbed. Combined with strong rules for the waters outside these sanctuaries, this kind of network is essential if we are to stop the collapse of marine biodiversity and rebuild the abundance that once defined our seas.

The choices made at CBD COP15 will echo for generations. Governments can choose to confront the drivers of biodiversity loss—overexploitation, habitat destruction, pollution and a growth‑at‑all‑costs economy—or they can hide behind accounting tricks and weak targets. They can choose to channel substantial finance into real protection, restoration and Indigenous‑led stewardship, or allow it to be siphoned off into false solutions that greenwash business as usual.

The living world is resilient, but only if we give it space and time to heal. Protecting the last intact forests, restoring degraded landscapes, ending destructive fishing and carving out large, well‑managed ocean sanctuaries are not optional extras; they are the foundation of a liveable future. Human greed has driven us to the brink of a mass extinction. Human courage, solidarity and respect for the interconnectedness of all life can still pull us back.
