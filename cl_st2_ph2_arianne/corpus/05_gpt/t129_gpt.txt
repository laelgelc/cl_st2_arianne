The global food system is in deep crisis, and the people paying the highest price are those who did the least to cause it.

The Russian war on Ukraine, the COVID-19 pandemic, and mounting economic turmoil have combined to drive a surge in food prices around the world. These shocks are landing on top of escalating climate impacts, creating a perfect storm of hunger and inequality that is pushing millions closer to the brink.

Recent figures from the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) show that the global food price index has fallen slightly in recent months. But this limited relief is deeply misleading. Even after the drop, prices remain about 13% higher than they were a year ago, and this global average hides stark local realities. In some regions, food prices have tripled, turning basic staples into unaffordable luxuries for many families.

The war in Ukraine continues to destabilise a food system that was already fragile and unjust. Ukraine is a major exporter of grain, and the disruption of exports sent shockwaves through global markets. Recent grain shipments from Ukraine have brought some short-term relief and helped ease immediate supply pressures. Yet these shipments do not address the deeper structural problems that make the global food system so vulnerable to conflict, pandemics, and climate extremes.

At the heart of this broken system is a model of industrial agriculture and global trade dominated by a handful of powerful corporations. These companies control large parts of the supply chain—from seeds and fertilisers to shipping and commodity trading—and they have profited from volatility and speculation while people go hungry. In the midst of crisis, they have continued to expand operations that destroy ecosystems, drive deforestation, and encroach on Indigenous lands and territories.

This profit-driven model concentrates power and wealth, while exposing communities and small-scale producers to the full force of overlapping crises. Vulnerable populations—especially in the Global South, and including smallholder farmers, Indigenous peoples, and low-income urban communities—are being hit hardest by soaring prices and climate impacts. As droughts, floods, and heatwaves intensify, these communities face shrinking harvests, degraded soils, and mounting debts, even as food corporations report strong earnings.

The current moment demands political vigilance and decisive action. Governments must resist pressure from corporate lobbies that seek to use the crisis to entrench their power and roll back environmental and social protections. Instead, there is an urgent need for transparency across the food system, including clear information on pricing, trading, and corporate profits, so that the public can see who is benefiting from turmoil and who is bearing the costs.

Supporting local farmers and agroecological practices is central to building a more resilient and fair food system. Agroecology—grounded in ecological principles and local knowledge—helps protect biodiversity, restore soils, and reduce dependence on fossil fuel-based inputs. It can strengthen local food systems and empower communities to feed themselves sustainably, rather than leaving them at the mercy of distant markets and corporate decisions.

To curb profiteering in times of crisis, governments should introduce windfall taxes on corporations that are cashing in on food price spikes and speculation. Revenues from such taxes can be redirected to support those most affected by rising prices, and to invest in sustainable, community-based food systems.

Regulatory reforms are also essential. This includes measures to rein in excessive speculation in commodity markets, strengthen antitrust and competition rules to limit corporate concentration, and protect ecosystems and Indigenous lands from destructive agricultural expansion. Policies must be designed to promote food sovereignty—the right of peoples and communities to define their own food systems—so that decisions about what to grow, how to grow it, and who benefits are made democratically and in line with environmental limits.

The overlapping crises of war, pandemic, economic instability, and climate breakdown are exposing the deep injustices of the current food system. Short-term fixes, like temporary grain shipments, may ease immediate pressures but will not resolve the underlying drivers of hunger and inequality. Transforming the food system requires confronting corporate power, centring the rights and needs of communities, and investing in sustainable, locally rooted alternatives.

The path forward is clear: transparency instead of secrecy, public interest over private profit, and food sovereignty and agroecology instead of a fragile, corporate-controlled system that leaves millions hungry while a few grow richer from crisis.
