I grew up in Indonesia surrounded by some of the most beautiful rainforests on Earth. Today, those same forests are being cleared at a terrifying rate to make way for palm oil plantations. The destruction is brutal and visible: ancient trees cut down, wildlife driven from their homes, and entire landscapes turned into industrial monocultures.

This isn’t just about trees. When rainforests are destroyed, endangered species lose the last fragments of their habitat. Communities are pushed aside or exploited, their land and livelihoods sacrificed for plantation expansion. The impacts are not abstract. In 2015, fires linked to this expansion choked the air, harming people’s health and destroying ecosystems on a massive scale.

That’s why I joined other Greenpeace activists to take a stand. We boarded a ship owned by Wilmar, one of the world’s biggest palm oil traders, as it carried dirty palm oil to Europe. Our message was clear: Wilmar’s role in driving deforestation and human rights abuses must end. This palm oil is not just another commodity. It carries with it the loss of forests, the suffering of communities, and the destruction of wildlife.

Big global brands have known about this for years. Companies behind products like Oreo promised the world they would clean up their palm oil supply chains. They said they would stop buying from destructive producers and ensure their ingredients didn’t come at the cost of forests and people. Those promises have not been kept. Dirty palm oil is still flowing into their products, and the chainsaws and fires are still tearing through our forests.

We cannot afford more empty words while the rainforest disappears. Every day of delay means more habitat lost, more communities harmed, and more climate chaos fueled by forest destruction. The responsibility lies not only with companies like Wilmar, but also with the global brands that keep buying from them.

This is a moment to act. We need real pressure on Wilmar and the companies that rely on its palm oil to change their practices now. That means ending deforestation, respecting human rights, and ensuring that palm oil production does not come at the expense of people and the planet.

I am asking for your support. Stand with those of us on the frontlines and help demand that Wilmar and its buyers finally live up to their promises. Together we can push them to stop the destruction, protect what remains of our rainforests, and give endangered species and local communities a fighting chance.
