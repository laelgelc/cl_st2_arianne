European cities are often celebrated for their beauty and history, but for many people, simply moving through them is an everyday struggle. As part of European Mobility Week, the #MobilityForAll campaign is sharing the experiences of people whose voices are too often ignored in discussions about urban planning and transport.

One of these stories comes from a mother in Romania, who describes how difficult it is to navigate her city with her baby and a stroller. What might seem like a simple trip to the shop or the doctor becomes a complex obstacle course. Many buildings have no ramps, making entrances nearly impossible to access with a stroller. Sidewalks are often too high, broken, or full of potholes. Cars are parked on pavements, forcing her into the street. Buses are not reliably accessible, and pedestrian paths feel unsafe.

Her experience shows how a city designed around cars instead of people can exclude parents with small children, as well as many others who rely on accessible infrastructure. She imagines something very different: child-friendly streets with ramps wherever they are needed, smooth and continuous sidewalks, and safe walkways that allow her and her baby to move freely and confidently.

Despite repeatedly asking for improvements, she saw little to no change. The frustration of constantly battling an environment that did not consider her needs eventually pushed her to leave the city and move to the countryside. Her story is not just about one person’s struggle; it reflects a wider failure to build cities that work for everyone.

The #MobilityForAll campaign is using testimonies like hers to call for a fundamental shift in how European cities are planned and managed. The demands are clear: car-free city centers where people can walk and gather safely; better public transport; shared mobility options; improved cycling and walking infrastructure; and more green spaces. These changes aim to create cities where parents with strollers, children, older people, people with disabilities, and all residents can move safely and with dignity.

The campaign invites people across Europe to add their voices and experiences, and to push decision-makers to act, by joining and sharing under the hashtag #MobilityForAll.
