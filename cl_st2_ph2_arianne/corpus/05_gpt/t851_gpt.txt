For Captain Mike Fincken, the ocean is not just a workplace; it is home. After three decades at sea, much of that time spent in West African waters, he has watched that home change—and not for the better. What was once a place of abundance has become a region marked by overfishing, poor management, and widespread illegal activity.

From his vantage point on the bridge of the Greenpeace ship *Esperanza*, Captain Mike has seen how weak regional fisheries management allows industrial fleets to exploit West Africa’s rich waters. He describes how a lack of effective rules—and poor enforcement of those that do exist—has opened the door to overfishing on a massive scale. The result is a steady decline in fish stocks, with serious consequences for food security and the livelihoods of coastal communities that depend on the sea.

For two and a half months, Captain Mike and his crew are sailing through West African waters to document the real-world impacts of this overfishing crisis. Their work focuses on how industrial fishing affects fish populations, the availability of affordable protein for local people, and the resilience of communities whose cultures and economies are tied to the ocean.

The stories he brings from previous campaigns illustrate the scale and nature of the problem. He recalls chasing pirate fishing vessels that operated with impunity, plundering fish stocks without regard for rules or local needs. He has witnessed infractions by Chinese fleets, seen firsthand as they violated regulations in pursuit of profit. He has supported authorities in making arrests at sea, helping to bring some of these offenders to justice. And he has watched enormous European “Monster boats” at work—vast industrial ships capable of removing huge quantities of fish in a short time, with devastating effects on local ecosystems and small-scale fishers.

These experiences have shaped Captain Mike’s conviction that urgent regional fisheries management is essential. He argues that only strong, coordinated action across West African countries can promote truly sustainable fishing and put an end to the ongoing exploitation of their waters. Without this, he fears that the ocean he calls home will continue to be emptied—at the expense of marine life, coastal communities, and future generations.

From the deck of the *Esperanza*, his message is clear: the decline he has witnessed is not inevitable. With determined regional cooperation and a commitment to sustainability, West Africa’s seas can still be protected and restored.
