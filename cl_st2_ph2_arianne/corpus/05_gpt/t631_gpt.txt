Wallace Smith Broecker’s passing marks the loss of a scientist who saw the climate crisis coming long before most of the world was willing to listen. In 1975, he predicted global warming, warning that our addiction to fossil fuels would destabilise the very systems that make life on Earth possible. His work helped lay the foundations of modern climate science, and his death feels like a turning point: a moment when one generation’s warnings give way to another generation’s demands.

Today, those demands are being led by young people. Across the world, youth-led school strikes, inspired by Greta Thunberg, are challenging the complacency that has allowed emissions to rise and impacts to intensify. These students are walking out of classrooms to insist on a livable future, refusing to accept that their lives will be shaped by decisions made by leaders who ignore the science. Their message is simple and urgent: the climate crisis is here, it is visible, and it cannot be postponed.

The impacts they point to are no longer abstract projections. Extreme weather is becoming part of daily reality for communities everywhere. From record-breaking heatwaves to increasingly violent storms, people are living through the very changes scientists like Broecker warned about. Rising global temperatures and record heat are not distant possibilities; they are the backdrop to our politics and our lives right now.

The science has also become more precise and more urgent. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has warned that we have roughly 12 years to act decisively to avoid climate chaos. That means halving global CO2 emissions by 2030 and reaching net zero by 2050. These are not just technical targets; they define the narrow window in which we can still prevent the worst impacts of climate breakdown.

On paper, the world has already recognised the scale of the crisis. The Paris Agreement set out a shared commitment to limit global temperature rise, and COP24 established rules intended to turn that agreement into action. Yet the gap between promises and reality remains enormous. Despite these international frameworks, political inaction persists. Governments continue to move too slowly, even as temperatures climb and new heat records are set.

This disconnection between what leaders say and what they do is at the heart of the anger driving the school strikes. Young people see that the science is clear, the solutions are known, and the consequences of delay are devastating—yet those in power still treat climate action as optional. Their strikes are a direct challenge to that failure, a refusal to be silent as the window for meaningful action closes.

In mourning Wallace Smith Broecker, we are also confronted with the legacy of ignored warnings. For decades, scientists have sounded the alarm. Now, a new generation is taking up that alarm and turning it into a global call for justice. Their courage and clarity demand a response that matches the scale of the crisis.

Solidarity with these striking youth is not symbolic; it is essential. Standing with them means insisting that leaders move beyond rhetoric to real, rapid change. It means demanding that governments strengthen their commitments under the Paris framework, align policies with the IPCC’s timeline, and treat the halving of emissions by 2030 and net zero by 2050 as non-negotiable.

As we remember a scientist who helped uncover the truth about our warming planet, we are called to honour that truth in action. The youth marching out of their schools are not just protesting; they are defending the future that Broecker and so many others warned was at risk. Their voices are a reminder that the era of delay must end, and that the time for bold, uncompromising climate leadership is now.
