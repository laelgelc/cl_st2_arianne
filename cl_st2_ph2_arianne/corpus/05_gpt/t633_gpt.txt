The Paraopeba River once pulsed with life. Its waters were clear enough for children to play in, and its fish sustained families who had lived along its banks for generations. Today, after the collapse of Vale’s dam, a long stretch of that river has fallen silent.

For about 40 kilometers, the Paraopeba is effectively dead. Toxic mud has smothered its currents, carrying with it heavy metals like nickel, mercury, lead, zinc, and cadmium. The water is so turbid that light barely penetrates it, and the oxygen levels have dropped so low that fish and other aquatic life can no longer survive. What was once a living river has become a brown, suffocating corridor of contamination.

People who depended on the river feel this loss in every part of their daily lives. Couples like Jair and Conceição, who used to fish in the Paraopeba, have given up entirely. They no longer trust the water or the fish that might still be found there. Instead, they’ve turned to an artificial dam, trying to salvage a piece of the life they once had, even if it means traveling farther and working harder for each catch.

The emotional toll is as heavy as the toxic mud. Residents talk about the disappearance of fish species they knew since childhood, the sudden absence of the river’s colors and reflections, the way the landscape itself seems to have lost its soul. The Paraopeba was not just a water source; it was a place of memory, leisure, and identity. Now, standing on its banks, many describe only sadness and a sense of emptiness where joy used to be.

The catastrophe has also shaken the foundations of community life. Pará de Minas, a city that depends on the Paraopeba for its water supply, has had to declare a state of emergency. This decision reflects just how serious the contamination is. Routines have been upended as authorities and residents scramble to secure safe water, adapt to restrictions, and cope with the uncertainty about what comes next.

What was once a flowing, life-giving river is now a stark reminder of the consequences when safety fails and toxic waste is allowed to pour into the heart of a community. For the people along the Paraopeba, the disaster is not an abstract environmental issue. It is a daily reality, felt in every glass of water, every empty fishing net, and every quiet, contaminated bend of the river that no longer runs as it once did.
