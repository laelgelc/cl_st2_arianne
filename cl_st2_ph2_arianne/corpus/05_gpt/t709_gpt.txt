A newly updated Census of Earth’s Biomass paints a stark picture of how deeply humanity has reshaped life on our planet. By measuring the mass of living organisms, this global snapshot reveals both the sheer dominance of plants and the profound imbalance our species has created across the tree of life.

Plants account for more than 80% of all global biomass, and the vast majority of that is found on land rather than in the oceans. This green foundation underpins the entire biosphere, capturing sunlight, storing carbon, and sustaining food webs above and below ground.

Animals, by contrast, make up just 0.37% of global biomass. Within that small fraction, arthropods—such as insects, spiders, and crustaceans—represent about half of all animal mass. Despite their tiny size, their collective presence is immense, and they play essential roles in pollination, decomposition, and as a food source for countless other species.

The most dramatic finding, however, is how thoroughly humans have reconfigured the mammal world. Humans and our livestock now make up 96% of all mammal biomass. Wild mammals, once the dominant large animals across continents and oceans, have been reduced to a tiny remnant of their former abundance. This shift is not a natural outcome of evolution, but the result of centuries of habitat conversion, hunting, and industrial expansion.

The updated census underscores that human activity has already halved global biomass since the dawn of agriculture. Forests, once stretching unbroken across vast regions, have been devastated—around 70% of forests have been destroyed. Oceans have fared no better: industrial fishing and overexploitation have depleted many fish stocks by an estimated 85–90%, stripping marine ecosystems of their complexity and resilience.

Even the smallest creatures are under assault. Insect populations, critical to pollination, soil health, and food chains, are declining under the pressure of pesticides and habitat loss. These losses ripple through ecosystems, weakening their ability to adapt to climate change, store carbon, and support human communities.

Taken together, the numbers reveal not just a shift in biomass, but a profound disruption of species diversity. A planet once rich in wild mammals, fish, insects, and forests is increasingly dominated by humans, our crops, and our livestock.

The message from this census is unambiguous: to preserve biodiversity and the living systems we all depend on, humanity must halt the destruction of habitats. Protecting and restoring forests, safeguarding oceans, and reducing our pressure on land and wildlife are essential steps if we are to prevent further collapse of the planet’s biological wealth.
