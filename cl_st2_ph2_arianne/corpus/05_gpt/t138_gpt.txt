When Pukaldi left his home in Indonesia to work at sea, he expected hard work and long days. What he did not expect was to spend two and a half years on the water without once setting foot on land.

For 30 months, he was trapped in a distant water fishing operation that relied on transshipment – the practice of transferring catch from one vessel to another at sea. While this system can help companies keep their fleets operating far from shore for long periods, it also allows them to keep workers like Pukaldi isolated, invisible, and vulnerable to abuse.

On board, he faced exhausting working hours, poor living conditions, and wages that never came. Cut off from land, he had no easy way to seek help, report abuses, or simply leave. His experience is not an isolated case, but part of a wider pattern of exploitation of migrant workers in the global fishing industry. These abuses are closely linked to illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing, where weak oversight and opaque supply chains create space for both environmental destruction and human rights violations.

Greenpeace Indonesia has been working to expose and challenge this system through its Beyond Seafood campaign, which focuses on ending slavery at sea as part of a broader push to improve ocean governance. The campaign highlights how protecting workers and protecting the oceans are inseparable: when fishing fleets operate beyond the reach of effective regulation, both people and marine ecosystems pay the price.

Refusing to accept what had happened to him, Pukaldi decided to fight back. With support from SBMI (the Indonesian Migrant Workers Union), he took the Indonesian government to court. Their lawsuit argued that the government had delayed issuing a key regulation needed to implement a 2017 law on the protection of migrant workers. Without this regulation, the law’s promises of better safeguards for workers at sea remained largely on paper.

In June 2022, after years of pressure, the long-awaited regulation was finally signed. This was an important step forward, and in response, the lawsuit was revoked. But the story does not end there.

Greenpeace Indonesia, SBMI, and allies continue working to ensure that the new rules are not just written, but truly enforced. That means making sure the regulation is implemented in practice, that migrant fishers are protected before they depart and while they are at sea, and that cases like unpaid wages – including those owed to workers like Pukaldi – are properly addressed.

Pukaldi’s journey from exploitation to legal action shows both the scale of the problem and the power of collective resistance. It is a reminder that behind every shipment of seafood are human beings whose rights must be respected, and that real change at sea depends on strong laws, effective enforcement, and the courage of workers who refuse to stay silent.
