Greenpeace activists aboard the ship Esperanza took action in Jamaica during the 25th Assembly of the International Seabed Authority (ISA), sending a clear message: the body tasked with managing the seabed is failing to protect our deep oceans from the threat of mining.

Their protest shone a spotlight on how the ISA has become fixated on exploiting the deep sea rather than safeguarding it. Instead of prioritizing protection, it is pushing ahead with plans that would open up vast, fragile ocean ecosystems to industrial extraction. At the same time, the ISA lacks the capacity to properly understand or manage the multiple environmental stresses that deep-sea mining would bring, from sediment plumes to noise and light pollution in some of the planet’s most pristine habitats.

The way the ISA handles environmental concerns is a major part of the problem. Rather than taking an independent, precautionary approach, it leans heavily on environmental impact assessments produced and led by the very companies that want to mine the seabed. These assessments are not independent, and this setup sidelines genuine scientific scrutiny and public-interest oversight in favour of corporate interests.

This bias is further entrenched by how the ISA treats mining applications. It has never denied a company a license, revealing a pattern that consistently favours industry over the ocean. Close, “cozy” relationships between decision-makers and mining companies reinforce this imbalance, raising serious questions about whose interests are really being served.

The ISA’s influence also reaches into wider ocean governance. Instead of supporting a strong Global Ocean Treaty that could establish powerful safeguards for the high seas, the ISA has lobbied for weaker rules and governance. This undermines efforts to create robust protections, including large-scale ocean sanctuaries that would keep vulnerable areas off-limits to destructive activities like deep-sea mining.

In the face of this, the call to action is clear. Ocean sanctuaries must be created and managed with protection, not profit, as the top priority. People around the world are being urged to sign a petition demanding that governments back strong ocean sanctuaries and a truly protective global framework for the high seas. By adding their names, they can help push back against an authority that has lost sight of its duty to the ocean and support a future where the deep sea is preserved, not plundered.
