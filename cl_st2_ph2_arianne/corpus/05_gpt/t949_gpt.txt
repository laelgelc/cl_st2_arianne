In 2014, members of the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) took a step that set the organisation apart from all others in the world: they voted to protect the vast majority of Intact Forest Landscapes (IFLs) within FSC-certified areas. These are some of the last large, unfragmented forests on Earth, and their protection under certification makes FSC unique globally.

One of the most critical regions for this commitment is the Congo Basin. As the world’s second-largest rainforest, and with most of it located in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), the Congo Basin remains largely intact. It is home to around 60 million people and provides habitat for wildlife such as gorillas and bonobos. It is also a major carbon reservoir, playing a vital role in stabilising the global climate.

Despite its relative intactness, the Congo Basin is under growing pressure. Industrial logging, expanding road networks, mining operations, and hydrocarbon development are driving forest degradation. These activities do not just threaten trees and wildlife. They are also linked with worsening poverty, fuelling conflict, and accelerating the loss of habitat that people and animals alike depend on.

In this context, FSC’s expansion into the Congo Basin comes with serious responsibilities. The region is marked by poor governance and ongoing human rights concerns, which means that any certification effort must be approached with extreme caution. For FSC to contribute positively, its presence cannot simply legitimise business-as-usual exploitation under a green label.

Success in the Congo Basin hinges on several key conditions. High protection standards for forests, especially IFLs, must be upheld in practice, not only on paper. Communities living in and around these forests must give their consent to any activities that affect them, through a genuine process of Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC). Beyond consent, forest use must generate real, tangible benefits for local people, who are both rights-holders and frontline defenders of these ecosystems.

If these conditions are met, FSC certification in the Congo Basin has the potential to help reshape how logging is done in the region. Instead of driving destruction, logging models could be transformed to prioritise forest integrity, community rights, and long-term sustainability. This transformation would not only matter for the Congo Basin itself, but could also influence how forests are managed in other parts of the world where intact landscapes, climate stability, and human rights are all on the line.
