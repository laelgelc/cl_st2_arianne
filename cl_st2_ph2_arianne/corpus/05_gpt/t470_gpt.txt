The COVID-19 crisis has exposed how deeply our lives are intertwined with each other and with the natural world. As health systems strain and economies wobble, one thing is painfully clear: the choices governments make now will shape not just the recovery, but the future of our societies and the planet.

In this moment of upheaval, public money is being mobilised on a massive scale. The question is not whether billions will be spent, but who and what those funds will serve. We cannot allow public funds to be used to prop up the very industries that are driving climate breakdown and destroying ecosystems. Instead, this is the time to direct resources toward a just transition that puts human well-being and planetary health at the centre.

That means demanding that leaders are held accountable for how they use this crisis. We need vigilance against attempts to use the pandemic as cover to roll back protections, weaken rights, or deepen inequality. The so‑called “shock doctrine”—where emergencies are exploited to push through harmful policies—must not be allowed to define this moment. Workers, communities, and the most vulnerable people cannot be treated as collateral damage in the rush to restore “business as usual.”

The alternative is a cooperative, egalitarian future in which our economies work in harmony with nature rather than against it. This vision is rooted in solidarity, not scapegoating. Blame and division only weaken our collective ability to confront the virus and the wider social and ecological crises it has laid bare. Across borders and movements, we need to build alliances that can push for systemic change: fairer economies, stronger social protections, and environmental policies that respect the limits of the planet.

The pandemic also offers a stark opportunity to learn long-ignored lessons. It forces us to confront structural injustices, fragile safety nets, and the way environmental destruction increases vulnerability. Protecting those who are already at risk—whether from illness, poverty, or climate impacts—must be a central goal of any recovery. Compassion, courage, and cooperation are not just moral imperatives; they are practical tools for safeguarding both people and the Earth.

Within Greenpeace, members are openly sharing how this crisis is affecting them: the fear, isolation, and uncertainty, but also the hope they find in everyday acts of solidarity. From mutual aid in communities to people checking in on neighbours and colleagues, these actions are reminders that even in isolation, we are not alone. They show the kind of shared responsibility that any just and sustainable future will require.

At the same time, there is a recognition that to stay engaged and vigilant, we must also care for ourselves. Self-care is not an afterthought; it is what allows people to keep supporting others, keep organising, and keep watching closely as decisions are made in our name. Rest, reflection, and connection—however we can find it—are part of how we remain strong enough to resist harmful agendas and push for the transformations we need.

This crisis will end, but the choices made during it will echo for years. Turning away from planet‑destroying industries, insisting that public funds serve people and the planet, standing against exploitation, and nurturing solidarity are all part of shaping a recovery that truly heals.
