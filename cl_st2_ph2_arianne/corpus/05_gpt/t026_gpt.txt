Across the world, women are on the frontlines of resistance against multiple forms of oppression. Their struggles are deeply connected: against patriarchal violence, against extractive economies that destroy land and livelihoods, and against authoritarian systems that silence dissent. From the forests of India to the streets of Argentina and Iran, women are confronting colonial, capitalist, and patriarchal structures while building new visions of justice and freedom.

The feminist uprising in Iran following the death of Jina Amini is one of the most powerful recent examples. Her death sparked a wave of protests that brought together people from different backgrounds and beliefs, united around demands for democratic values and fundamental rights. The response from the regime has been violent, but the movement has resonated far beyond Iran’s borders. “Jin Jiyan Azadi” – “Woman, Life, Freedom” – has become a rallying cry of global solidarity, connecting struggles against gendered oppression with broader fights for liberation and dignity.

This uprising sits within a wider eco-feminist tradition in which women have organized at the intersections of environmental, social, and gender justice. One such movement is India’s Chipko Movement, where rural and Indigenous women used nonviolent direct action to protect their forests. By literally hugging trees to prevent them from being cut down, they halted deforestation and defended their communities’ relationships with land, water, and livelihoods. Their actions challenged not only environmental destruction, but also the economic and political systems driving it.

In Argentina, the Ni Una Menos movement has mobilized massive marches against femicides and gender-based violence. It has grown into a powerful force that fosters intersectional solidarity, connecting issues like economic injustice, reproductive rights, and state violence. By insisting that no woman or gender-diverse person be reduced to a statistic or a private tragedy, Ni Una Menos exposes how patriarchal violence is embedded in wider social and political structures.

These movements, though rooted in different places and histories, share key principles. They show that resistance is strongest when it is intersectional, when it understands how gender, class, race, colonial histories, and environmental exploitation are intertwined. They highlight the importance of solidarity that crosses borders and identities, amplifying the voices of those most affected rather than speaking over them. And they demonstrate that transformative change is driven by communities themselves, especially women and gender-diverse people who face overlapping forms of oppression.

Learning from these struggles means listening carefully to those on the frontlines, recognizing their leadership, and supporting their visions for alternative futures. It means understanding that the fight against patriarchal violence cannot be separated from the fight against extractive capitalism or from the legacies of colonial domination. The courage of the Chipko women, the mass mobilizations of Ni Una Menos, and the defiant cry of “Jin Jiyan Azadi” all point toward a world where liberation is collective, rooted in care for each other and for the Earth.

The path forward lies in deepening intersectional solidarity, standing with those who risk their lives and freedom in the streets, forests, and communities where these struggles unfold. By learning from them and acting alongside them, we can help push forward the transformative changes needed to dismantle oppressive systems and build societies grounded in justice, equality, and life.
