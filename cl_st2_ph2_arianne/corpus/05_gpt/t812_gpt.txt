In the late 1960s film *The Graduate*, a family friend leans in and offers the young protagonist a single word of career advice: “Plastics.” It captured the spirit of the age—plastics as the future, a symbol of modern convenience and economic opportunity.

Since the 1950s, that prediction has played out on a massive scale. Plastic production has soared, and plastic has become woven into almost every aspect of daily life. But what was once sold as a miracle material is now choking the very ecosystems we depend on, especially our oceans.

In places like the North Pacific gyre, the scale of pollution is stark. Here, plastic debris accumulates in such quantities that it now outweighs plankton. The ocean surface, which should be teeming with microscopic life forming the base of the marine food web, is increasingly contaminated with floating fragments, packaging, and discarded fishing gear. This plastic soup is not just an eyesore—it’s deadly.

Seabirds, turtles, fish, and marine mammals are all ingesting plastic. Mistaking it for food or swallowing it accidentally, they suffer blockages in their digestive systems, internal injuries, and exposure to toxic substances associated with plastics. The toll is devastating: up to a million seabirds and 100,000 marine mammals die every year as a result of plastic pollution. These are not isolated incidents but symptoms of a global system that treats plastic as disposable, even though it persists in the environment for decades or longer.

Addressing this crisis means changing that system at its roots, not just cleaning up the mess after the fact. One key step is a global ban on single-use plastics—items designed to be used once and discarded, such as many types of packaging and disposable products. Phasing out these throwaway items can significantly reduce the flow of new plastic into our oceans.

Corporate accountability is just as important. Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) shifts the burden of waste from the public and the environment back onto the companies that design, produce, and profit from plastic products. Under strong EPR schemes, producers must take responsibility for the full life cycle of their products, including collection, reuse, and recycling, rather than leaving communities and ecosystems to absorb the costs.

Investing in public water infrastructure is another crucial part of the solution. When people have reliable access to safe, publicly provided drinking water, the demand for single-use plastic bottles can be dramatically reduced. Robust public systems can help break the dependence on disposable packaging that has become normalized over the past several decades.

Greenpeace is calling on G20 nations to put prevention at the heart of their response to plastic pollution. That means prioritizing policies that stop plastic from being produced and discarded in the first place, rather than relying on end-of-pipe fixes. It means committing to phase out throwaway plastic items and supporting innovation in reusable systems, alternative materials, and new business models that do not rely on disposability.

The world that *The Graduate* glimpsed in a single word has become our everyday reality. Now, another word needs to define our future: responsibility. By acting decisively—banning single-use plastics, enforcing Extended Producer Responsibility, investing in public water, and pushing G20 governments to lead—we can turn the tide on plastic pollution and give our oceans, and the life they sustain, a chance to recover.
