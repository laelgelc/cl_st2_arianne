Greenpeace Japan is calling on families to make a powerful change at the dinner table: switch to organic food to reduce exposure to synthetic pesticides and help fix our broken food system. By choosing organic, households can send a clear message that they want food that is safer for people and the planet, while also pushing the market to make organic options more available and affordable.

To better understand how diet affects pesticide exposure, Greenpeace Japan supported a small study with two families who have children. For 10 days, the families ate a diet made up of 100% organic food. Before and after the switch, researchers measured pesticide levels in their urine. The results showed that pesticide levels dropped significantly after the families changed their diets to organic.

The study also highlighted that children had higher initial pesticide levels than adults. This is especially worrying because children are more vulnerable: their organs are still developing, and they receive higher doses of chemicals per kilogram of body weight compared to adults. Reducing pesticide exposure early in life is therefore particularly important.

Greenpeace Japan stresses that while going organic is a crucial step, the ultimate goal is a truly pesticide-free life. For this, it recommends what it calls “eco food.” Eco food is more than just pesticide-free: it is locally grown, seasonal, and nutritious. It supports biodiversity and ensures that farmers receive fair pay for their work. By choosing eco food whenever possible, families can protect their health, support farmers, and contribute to a food system that works in harmony with nature instead of against it.

Every purchase is a vote for the kind of food system we want. When more people choose organic and eco food, it can drive change across supply chains, encourage more farmers to shift away from synthetic pesticides, and help build a future where healthy, sustainable food is the norm—not the exception.
