Far below the waves, in the cold and crushing darkness, the deep ocean is alive with ancient coral reefs, towering underwater mountains and long‑lived sea creatures. These hidden worlds have evolved over millions of years and hold vital clues about how life began on Earth. They are also part of a delicate system that helps store carbon and regulate our climate.

Now, a new industry wants to rip open the seabed in the name of profit.

Deep sea mining companies are pushing to extract minerals from the ocean floor, despite scientists warning that disturbing these fragile ecosystems could cause irreversible harm. The machines and methods proposed to scrape, crush and vacuum the seabed threaten marine life that we barely understand, and could disrupt processes that lock carbon away in the deep. At a time of accelerating climate breakdown, adding a new source of damage to the largest carbon sink on the planet is a risk we cannot afford.

This rush to exploit the deep ocean is unfolding just as governments negotiate a Global Ocean Treaty – a crucial opportunity to protect international waters and create vast ocean sanctuaries. As countries debate how to safeguard the seas for future generations, the deep sea mining industry is lobbying hard behind the scenes to secure its own access. Already, an area of seabed the size of France and Germany combined has been opened up for exploration, even though full‑scale mining has not yet begun and the consequences are still largely unknown.

Greenpeace investigations have uncovered how this emerging industry is structured: a web of companies based in the Global North using sponsoring states in the Global South to gain access to international seabed areas. This model exposes those states to political, financial and environmental risks, while allowing corporate actors to present themselves as responsible partners. The findings cut through the industry’s polished promises and highlight how unequal and dangerous this new frontier could be.

Around the world, people are refusing to accept the idea that the deep ocean should be sacrificed for short‑term corporate gain. Activists, communities and scientists are calling for protection, not exploitation, and demanding that governments choose safeguarding the oceans over opening them up to industrial mining.
