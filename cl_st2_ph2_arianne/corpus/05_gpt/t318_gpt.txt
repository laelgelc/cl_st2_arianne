The Rainbow Warrior has sailed into the remote Clarion Clipperton Zone in the Pacific Ocean to bear witness to an emerging threat: deep sea mining. In these dark, little-known waters, companies like The Metals Company and GSR are pushing to open up the seabed to industrial extraction, despite the risks to marine life, coastal communities, and the climate.

During tests in the area, Greenpeace documented GSR’s 25-tonne prototype mining machine disconnecting and becoming stuck on the seabed. This breakdown did not happen in a controlled lab environment, but thousands of metres below the surface, in one of the least understood ecosystems on Earth. The tests also created visible sediment clouds from the disturbance of the seafloor – plumes of fine particles that can spread through the water, potentially smothering and disrupting deep ocean life.

These are not abstract concerns for the Pacific. Activists on board, including Fijian campaigner Victor Pickering, are raising the alarm about what deep sea mining could mean for ocean wildlife, for the livelihoods of Pacific peoples who depend on a healthy ocean, and for the ocean’s vital role in storing carbon in a time of accelerating climate change. The push to carve up the seabed for minerals is happening while we still know very little about how this fragile environment functions, or how it might be damaged.

In response, Greenpeace has taken peaceful action at sea, including painting the word “RISK” on GSR’s vessel to highlight the dangers of ploughing ahead with this industry. That message is aimed not only at one company, but at decision-makers worldwide who are weighing short-term profit against long-term planetary health.

Greenpeace is calling for a strong Global Ocean Treaty that can create ocean sanctuaries and keep industrial exploitation out of vulnerable areas like the Clarion Clipperton Zone. The organisation is urging millions of people to stand together in opposition to deep sea mining and to demand protection, not destruction, for the deep ocean.
