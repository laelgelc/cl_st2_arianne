Governments are gathering at the United Nations in New York for the third round of negotiations on a Global Ocean Treaty, a decision that will shape the future of our seas. This treaty has the potential to create vast ocean sanctuaries, protecting marine life from the accelerating impacts of climate change, pollution, overfishing, and destructive industrial activity. It could be a turning point for the recovery of fragile ocean habitats that have been pushed to the brink.

Inside the UN, delegates are debating how ambitious this treaty will be. Outside, industry lobbyists are working hard to weaken it. But nearly 1.8 million people around the world have already made their voices heard by signing a petition calling for a strong, effective Global Ocean Treaty. That public pressure is a powerful counterweight to those who want to keep exploiting the oceans with minimal rules.

Greenpeace is in New York to ensure that people, not polluters, set the agenda. In the heart of the city, Times Square has been transformed with striking displays of whales and turtles, bringing the life-and-death stakes of these negotiations to one of the busiest crossroads on Earth. At the entrance to the UN itself, a giant whale sculpture greets negotiators as they arrive, a reminder of the majestic creatures whose fate depends on what happens in those meeting rooms.

Inside the UN, actor and ocean advocate Javier Bardem has addressed the negotiators directly, urging them to seize this historic chance to protect the oceans. And when they return to their hotel, delegates are faced with personalized posters calling on them to back a strong treaty, making it clear that the world is watching their decisions closely.

The outcome of this negotiation will determine whether governments choose bold protection for the oceans or allow business as usual to continue. With millions of people speaking up and visible pressure on leaders in New York, this is a moment when global public demand for ocean protection is impossible to ignore.
