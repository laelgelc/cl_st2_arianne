Nine years ago, some of the world’s biggest brands publicly promised to end deforestation in their supply chains by 2020. That deadline is now just 200 days away, yet forests are still being destroyed on a vast scale, and the companies that made those promises are failing to act with the urgency the situation demands.

Since those commitments were made, an area of forest the size of Spain has been put at risk. Instead of moving rapidly to protect forests, many companies have carried on with business as usual, relying on suppliers that are still driving deforestation.

Greenpeace surveyed more than 50 major companies to see how they were progressing towards their no-deforestation goals. Only a few even bothered to respond. None of them were able to show that they were taking meaningful steps to cut ties with suppliers linked to forest destruction. One of the key companies in this destructive chain is Cargill, a powerful agribusiness trader. Cargill itself has admitted it will not meet the 2020 deadline to eliminate deforestation from its supply chains, yet brands continue to buy from it.

The consequences on the ground are devastating. In Brazil, the Cerrado – a vast, biodiverse savannah that supports countless species and communities – has already lost nearly half of its native vegetation. This destruction is largely driven by the expansion of soya plantations and cattle farming. As the land is cleared and converted, indigenous communities who depend on these ecosystems for their livelihoods, cultures and survival are put increasingly at risk.

This is happening in the midst of a climate and wildlife emergency. Forests like those in the Cerrado store huge amounts of carbon and are home to rich biodiversity. Their destruction accelerates climate breakdown and pushes more species towards extinction. Every hectare lost makes it harder to stabilise the climate and protect the web of life that sustains us all.

In response to this ongoing failure, Greenpeace activists took their message directly to the heart of the corporate world. They disrupted the Consumer Goods Forum Summit, a gathering of the very brands that promised to clean up their supply chains. Inside that summit are the decision-makers who could, right now, choose to stop buying from deforestation-linked suppliers and invest instead in protecting and restoring forests.

The demand is clear and urgent: companies must finally do what they promised. They need to end their role in deforestation, cut off suppliers like Cargill that are linked to forest destruction, and support the restoration of forests that have already been damaged. With the climate crisis deepening and wildlife under unprecedented threat, brands can no longer hide behind empty commitments and distant deadlines.

Forests – and the people and animals who depend on them – cannot afford any more broken promises. Either companies act now to end deforestation and help restore our living planet, or they will help drive it closer to extinction.
