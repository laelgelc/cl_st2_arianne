Across the world, many people are feeling the weight of overlapping crises. Climate breakdown, the rise of right-wing populism, deepening health challenges, discrimination and inequality, and mounting economic pressure are combining to create a powerful sense of insecurity and hopelessness. These aren’t separate problems. They feed into each other, reinforcing systems that harm both people and the planet.

Greenpeace Europe is responding by pushing for intersectional campaigning: an approach that connects environmental protection with struggles for justice in people’s lives, in politics, and in the economy. Instead of treating climate change as a single-issue problem, this approach looks at the root causes of multiple crises and highlights how they are intertwined.

To explore what this can look like in practice, Greenpeace Europe spoke with four climate justice activists whose work challenges the status quo and points towards more just futures.

Guppi Bola focuses on decolonising economics as a path towards racial and climate justice. This means questioning economic systems and assumptions that were shaped by colonial histories and that continue to drive both environmental destruction and racial inequality. By centering justice in economic thinking, her work pushes for models that don’t sacrifice communities or ecosystems for profit.

Chihiro Geuzebroek calls for halting destructive production, introducing universal basic income, and transforming how we think about work itself. Instead of an economy built on endless extraction and overwork, she envisions one where people’s basic needs are guaranteed and where labour is organised around care, ethics, and planetary limits.

Tatiana Garavito works on imagining and building new systems that can nourish everyone without exploitation. Her perspective challenges food and economic systems that rely on the exploitation of people and nature, and instead seeks structures that sustain life, dignity, and collective wellbeing.

Samie Blasingame focuses on reforming global food systems and treating agricultural land as a global common. This involves rethinking who controls land and for what purpose, so that feeding people and protecting ecosystems are prioritised over short-term profit and private accumulation.

By centering these voices and experiences, Greenpeace Europe is calling for a broader reimagining of what is possible. Intersectional climate justice is not only about cutting emissions; it is about transforming the systems that create inequality, environmental destruction, and social fragmentation in the first place. Listening to and amplifying those who are already building alternatives is a crucial step towards a world where people and planet can truly thrive together.
