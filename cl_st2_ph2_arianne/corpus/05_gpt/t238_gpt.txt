The outcome of COP26 in Glasgow leaves the world in a fragile and deeply unequal position. Governments agreed to keep the 1.5°C goal “alive” by recognizing the need for a 45% cut in global emissions this decade. They also, for the first time in a COP decision, named coal and fossil fuel subsidies, calling for a weak phase-out. Yet these words fall far short of the urgent action demanded by science and by communities already facing climate catastrophe.

For climate-vulnerable countries and communities, the Glasgow outcome is more than a disappointment; it is an insult. Wealthy governments once again failed to deliver the promised funding needed for recovery, adaptation, and addressing loss and damage. While leaders made speeches about solidarity and shared responsibility, the concrete support that frontline communities need to survive and rebuild did not materialize. The gap between what has been pledged and what is required to protect lives, cultures, and livelihoods remains stark.

Instead of closing loopholes and tightening rules, COP26 gave a worrying boost to carbon offsets. These mechanisms, if left unchecked, can allow big polluters to continue emitting while claiming “neutrality” on paper. The Glasgow decisions leave space for loopholes that endanger nature and threaten the rights and territories of Indigenous Peoples. Forests, ecosystems, and Indigenous lands risk being treated as accounting tools rather than living systems and homes that must be protected on their own terms.

Despite these failures, the pressure from outside the negotiation halls was powerful and persistent. Activists, Indigenous leaders, and youth movements brought courage and clarity to Glasgow. Through protests, direct actions, and uncompromising demands, they pushed governments to acknowledge fossil fuels, defend the 1.5°C limit, and confront the reality of climate injustice. Their presence and organizing were a driving force behind the limited progress that was achieved.

The work now shifts to COP27 in Egypt, where governments must move far beyond the half-measures of Glasgow. Stronger, science-based targets are essential, and they must be matched with real plans to end fossil fuels rather than merely “phase down” coal or tinker with subsidies. Climate-vulnerable communities cannot wait for another cycle of broken promises. Ending the fossil fuel era and delivering the support needed for adaptation, recovery, and loss and damage must be at the heart of what comes next.
