Outside the White House, people from many walks of life are standing together to stop three massive tar sands oil pipelines—Keystone XL, Enbridge, and Kinder-Morgan’s Trans Mountain Expansion (TMX). These projects are being called “fuses” to a vast “carbon bomb,” a warning that they would lock in more tar sands extraction and push the world closer to climate catastrophe.

At the Keystone XL protests in Washington, D.C., unions, Indigenous leaders, and climate activists are united in their opposition. They point to the environmental devastation already caused by tar sands extraction, the history and inevitability of oil spills along pipeline routes, and the serious health impacts on communities living near tar sands operations and proposed pipeline paths. They also stress that tar sands oil is among the highest greenhouse gas–emitting fuels on the planet, making any expansion fundamentally incompatible with efforts to limit global warming.

North of the border, Indigenous nations in Canada are rejecting the expansion plans for both Enbridge and TMX. Their message is clear: these pipelines threaten their lands, waters, and ways of life. The risks to rivers, coastlines, and traditional territories are too great, and the potential damage to communities and livelihoods cannot be justified in the name of expanding tar sands exports.

This resistance is not just symbolic. It has led to arrests at demonstrations, formal declarations against the projects, and growing pressure on decision-makers to act. Across borders, those on the front lines are calling for a halt to these pipelines as a crucial step in preventing further tar sands extraction and avoiding the worst impacts of global warming.
