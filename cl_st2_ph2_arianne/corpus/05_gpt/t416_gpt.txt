On August 4, 2020, a massive explosion tore through Beirut. From a suburban apartment outside the city, Julien Jreissati watched in shock as a huge plume of smoke rose from the port. Moments later, the blast wave hit, shattering glass, damaging buildings, and sending a shock that could be felt across the capital and far beyond.

The explosion was caused by the ignition of 2,750 tons of ammonium nitrate stored at the port. In a matter of seconds, it left a trail of devastation: over 150 people killed, more than 5,000 injured, and entire neighborhoods reduced to rubble. The human toll was immediate and overwhelming, and the scale of destruction was unlike anything many in Beirut had ever seen.

In the chaotic minutes after the blast, Julien did what so many in Lebanon did: he reached for his phone to check on family, friends, and colleagues. Messages poured in, calls dropped and reconnected, and slowly the outlines of the catastrophe became clear. People across the city were accounting for loved ones, rushing to hospitals, and offering help to strangers.

Within Greenpeace MENA, the first priority was safety. Julien and his colleagues quickly formed a crisis team to make sure all staff were accounted for and out of immediate danger. Once they had confirmed everyone’s safety, their focus shifted to understanding the health risks created by the explosion.

The detonation of such a large quantity of ammonium nitrate released significant amounts of nitrogen dioxide and ozone into the air. These pollutants can irritate the respiratory system and are especially worrying in a city already grappling with the COVID-19 pandemic. With hospitals under strain and people fearful of crowded spaces, any added respiratory risk was a serious concern.

To respond responsibly, the Greenpeace MENA team consulted experts to better understand the potential health impacts from the pollution generated by the blast. They worked to translate this emerging scientific understanding into practical safety guidelines for people living in and around Beirut, taking into account the added vulnerability created by COVID-19. This meant helping people understand what they could do to reduce exposure and protect themselves as much as possible in the days following the explosion.

At the same time, the team began investigating whether other pollutants were released and how the pollution was spreading. To do this, they turned to satellite imagery, using it as a tool to identify and track potential additional contaminants in the air. This work is part of an ongoing effort to understand the full environmental and health consequences of the disaster.

Amid the grief and destruction, one thing became immediately visible: the solidarity of Lebanese communities. Neighbors helped clear debris, strangers offered shelter, volunteers flooded the streets with brooms, masks, and first aid supplies. People opened their homes, organized food distributions, and mobilized in countless small and large ways to support those who had lost everything.

Greenpeace has focused on providing clear, accessible information about the toxic dust and pollution created by the explosion, so that people can better protect themselves and their families. Alongside this, they are encouraging those who are able to support humanitarian relief efforts on the ground by donating to the Red Cross, which is playing a central role in the emergency response and recovery.

In the face of such a devastating event, the combination of science-based guidance, community solidarity, and practical support offers a path forward for Beirut as it begins the long process of healing and rebuilding.
