Across Europe, people living next to factory farms are paying a heavy price for a food system that prioritises industrial production over human health, animal welfare, and the environment. Their stories reveal what it means to live with toxic smells, polluted air and water, and the constant anxiety of not knowing how this will affect their families’ futures.

In France, residents like Nicolas Mougel describe how the stench from nearby factory farms seeps into every part of daily life. It is not just an unpleasant smell – it affects how families use their homes, gardens, and shared spaces, and it shapes the way children grow up. The odours, often carrying ammonia and other pollutants, can be so intense that simple activities like opening a window or spending time outside become difficult or impossible.

For others, the consequences feel even more personal and frightening. An anonymous resident, N., lives close to a factory farm and has developed a rare form of eye cancer. She links her illness to the farm’s proximity and the pollution it brings. While questions about direct causation are complex, the fear and uncertainty she lives with are very real. Her story reflects a broader sense of vulnerability among communities who feel exposed to risks they did not choose and cannot control.

In Italy, local resistance is showing that people are not willing to accept this situation as inevitable. Maura Cappi has become a key figure in the fight against the expansion of factory farms. Through determined local organising and community pressure, she has helped stop attempts to enlarge industrial livestock facilities. These victories demonstrate that when communities come together, they can push back against powerful interests and defend their right to clean air, water, and a healthy environment.

In Spain, the impacts of factory farming are felt not only by nearby residents but also by small-scale farmers and local ecosystems. Farmer Ricardo Antón warns that industrial livestock production threatens biodiversity and the survival of smaller farms. As huge factory farms expand, they concentrate manure, chemicals, and emissions in specific areas, putting surrounding soils, rivers, and natural habitats at risk. At the same time, they undermine traditional farming practices that are more closely connected to the land and local communities.

In Denmark, the human health impacts are brought into sharp focus by people like Bente Joergensen. She suffers from health problems that she associates with the intense odours coming from nearby factory farms. Living with constant smells and suspected pollution can mean headaches, respiratory issues, stress, and sleepless nights. It also means feeling trapped: many residents cannot simply move away, even when their quality of life is clearly deteriorating.

Across these countries, the pattern is the same. Factory farming is driving pollution, contributing to climate emissions, and accelerating biodiversity loss. The massive numbers of animals kept in confined spaces generate huge amounts of manure and other waste, which can contaminate air and water. The system depends on large volumes of feed, energy, and transport, further increasing its climate footprint. As natural habitats are degraded and polluted, wildlife and ecosystems suffer, deepening the biodiversity crisis.

The stories from France, Italy, Spain, and Denmark show that this is not an abstract environmental issue. It is about people’s homes, health, livelihoods, and sense of security. It is about children growing up under clouds of foul air, farmers watching their way of life disappear, and communities forced to fight just to be heard.

There is another path. Eco-farming and plant-based alternatives offer a way to produce food that respects the limits of the planet while protecting communities. Eco-farming focuses on healthier soils, cleaner water, and more resilient local food systems. Veggie and plant-based foods can reduce the pressure to keep so many animals in industrial conditions, cutting pollution and climate emissions at the same time.

Everyone has a role to play in shifting away from destructive factory farming. Supporting eco-farming, choosing veggie alternatives, and standing with affected communities can help drive change. A global call to action is growing, uniting people who refuse to accept that toxic air, polluted water, and vanishing biodiversity are the price we must pay for food.

By listening to the people on the frontlines and supporting solutions that work for both communities and the planet, we can move towards a food system that nourishes life instead of harming it.
