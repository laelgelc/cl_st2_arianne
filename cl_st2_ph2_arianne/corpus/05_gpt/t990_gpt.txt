Barbie and Ken’s breakup was more than a pop culture moment—it was a wake-up call about what goes into the toys on our shelves and the packaging that surrounds them. When Barbie “dumped” Ken, it was for a serious reason: Mattel’s connection to products from Asia Pulp and Paper (APP), a company linked to the destruction of Indonesian rainforests and the loss of critical habitat for the endangered Sumatran tiger.

Greenpeace exposed how APP was trying to greenwash its image while forests were being cleared. Behind the glossy marketing and sustainability claims, the reality on the ground told a different story—one of disappearing forests and shrinking space for wildlife that depends on them to survive.

Using Barbie and Ken’s fictional breakup as a spotlight, people around the world took action. More than 500,000 emails were sent to Mattel, demanding that the company stop buying from suppliers tied to deforestation. This public pressure worked. Mattel committed to a global policy to keep deforestation out of its supply chains.

That policy includes avoiding controversial sources linked to forest destruction, increasing the use of recycled paper, and boosting the amount of wood certified by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC). These changes mean that the packaging and products associated with one of the world’s most recognizable toy brands are no longer propping up a business model based on destroying rainforests.

Mattel’s move adds to a growing wave of companies—such as Nestlé and Unilever—that have already taken action to distance themselves from APP and push it to reform its practices. Together, these decisions send a clear message: there is no future in forest destruction.

But exposing greenwashing, tracing destructive supply chains, and pushing corporations to change doesn’t happen on its own. It takes investigations, campaigns, and people willing to speak out and get involved. To keep halting deforestation and protecting wildlife like the Sumatran tiger, support is essential.

You can help by donating to sustain this work and by getting involved in campaigns that challenge companies and industries driving forest loss. Every action—every email, every share, every contribution—helps keep the pressure on and moves us closer to a world where forests, people, and wildlife are protected, not sacrificed for profit.
