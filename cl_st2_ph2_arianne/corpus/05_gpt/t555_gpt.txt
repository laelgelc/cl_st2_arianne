CO2 emissions are still rising, even as the climate emergency becomes more urgent by the day. One of the biggest drivers of this crisis is transport. Globally, the transport sector is responsible for about a quarter of energy-related CO2 emissions, and road transport alone accounts for the vast majority of that – around 74%. Every day, millions of cars, vans and trucks burn diesel and petrol, pumping more pollution into an already overheated atmosphere.

The car industry has played a central role in creating this problem. For decades, major automakers have aggressively pushed polluting diesel and petrol vehicles, locking societies into car dependency instead of supporting cleaner, fairer ways to move. SUV sales have surged, even though these vehicles are typically heavier, less efficient and more polluting than smaller cars. At the same time, car companies spend billions on green marketing and glossy sustainability promises, while their core business still revolves around selling more combustion-engine vehicles.

This contradiction is why protests at the Frankfurt Motor Show are so important. Behind the shiny concept cars and eco-slogans, the industry is still driving the climate crisis. Protesters are calling on automakers to stop blocking the shift to truly sustainable mobility and to rapidly change course. That means moving away from a model based on ever more private cars and towards systems that prioritise people and the planet.

Real solutions are already clear. Instead of more diesel and petrol cars – especially more SUVs – we need:

- Affordable, reliable public transport that works for everyone.
- Safe walking and cycling routes so people can choose active, low-carbon travel.
- Shared electric vehicles powered by renewable energy, not fossil fuels.

These options can cut emissions, reduce air pollution and make cities more liveable. But they will only become the norm if governments and industry stop clinging to the old, polluting model.

Phasing out internal combustion engines is a critical step. As long as diesel and petrol cars keep rolling off production lines, the world will struggle to get emissions under control. Continuing to sell combustion-engine vehicles while claiming climate leadership is like trying to mop up a flooded floor without turning off the tap. To avert climate catastrophe, that tap – the production and sale of fossil-fuelled cars – needs to be turned off as quickly and fairly as possible.

The protests at the Frankfurt Motor Show are part of a growing movement demanding that automakers face up to their responsibility and embrace a different future. A future where mobility is a public good, not a source of pollution and profit for a few. A future where clean, shared and renewable-powered transport is available to all.

Anyone who wants to support this shift can connect with others through People vs Oil on social media. By joining forces, sharing stories and amplifying demands, people around the world can put real pressure on the car industry and the politicians who protect it. Ending the age of fossil-fuelled cars is essential to tackling the climate emergency – and it will only happen if people stand together to demand it.
