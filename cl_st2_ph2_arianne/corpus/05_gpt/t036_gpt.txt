For decades, the fossil fuel industry has been at the center of a web of unlawful activities and systemic deception about the climate crisis. Europe-based giants such as Shell, TotalEnergies, and Equinor are among the companies that have been credibly alleged or proven to be involved in 26 separate criminal cases and offenses. These cases are not isolated incidents or historical anomalies; they form a pattern of behavior that has helped lock the world into escalating climate chaos.

Corruption stands out as the most recurrent offense linked to these companies. This is not just about individual bad actors, but about a business model that has depended on backroom deals, political capture, and the manipulation of public institutions to maintain power and profits. At the same time, a newer form of misconduct is becoming increasingly visible: greenwashing. While continuing to drive the climate crisis, the same corporations present themselves as climate leaders, using misleading claims and PR spin to obscure the reality of their operations and delay real action.

The consequences of this criminality and deception are felt most severely in the Global South. Communities in countries like Nigeria and Sudan have been forced to bear the brunt of pollution, environmental destruction, and human rights harms linked to fossil fuel extraction and infrastructure. These harms compound existing inequalities and vulnerabilities, leaving people with fewer resources to cope with the accelerating impacts of the climate crisis.

The fossil fuel industry as a whole is responsible for driving around one-third of global greenhouse gas emissions. These emissions are not abstract numbers; they are directly linked to the worsening climate disasters we see today. Catastrophic floods in Pakistan, devastating typhoons in the Philippines, and countless other extreme weather events are made more likely and more destructive by the warming caused by burning coal, oil, and gas.

This is why Greenpeace is demanding a fundamental change in course. New fossil fuel projects must be halted if the world is to have any chance of avoiding even more catastrophic climate breakdown. Companies that have contributed to this crisis must be held to account for their role in it, including their lies, greenwashing, and involvement in alleged or proven crimes. Climate justice means centering the rights and needs of those who have contributed least to the problem but are suffering first and worst from its impacts, particularly in the Global South.

Ending the fossil fuel industry’s crimes against people and the planet is not just a matter of better regulation or improved corporate behavior. It requires a decisive break with a destructive system and a rapid, fair transition to a world powered by clean, renewable energy, where those responsible for decades of harm are finally held accountable.
