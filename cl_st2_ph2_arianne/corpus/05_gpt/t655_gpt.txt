At COP24 in Poland, Greenpeace campaigner Kelvin Anthony is carrying a clear and urgent message from the Pacific to the world: Australia must end its dependency on coal as the climate crisis accelerates.

Speaking as a representative of Pacific nations, Anthony is confronting the stark reality that high-polluting countries, driven by profit, are failing to show the leadership needed to tackle climate change. This lack of ambition and responsibility is not abstract. It is already translating into more severe weather, rising seas, and escalating threats to the livelihoods, cultures, and very survival of Pacific island communities.

Pacific nations have contributed only a tiny fraction of global greenhouse gas emissions, yet they are on the frontline of climate impacts. Homes, food sources, freshwater, and sacred cultural sites are increasingly at risk as seas rise and storms intensify. These communities are not passive victims; they are actively demanding a rapid and just transition away from fossil fuels and towards renewable energy.

Anthony’s message at COP24 is rooted in justice and accountability. He is calling out the hypocrisy of countries that profit from coal and other fossil fuels while communities in the Pacific bear the consequences. He is working to ensure that the voices of those on the frontline of the crisis are heard in global climate negotiations, where decisions made far from the islands will shape their future.

Amid the urgency and injustice, Anthony also draws strength and hope from his daughter’s future. It is this personal motivation that underscores his work: to help secure a livable planet for the next generation, and to ensure that the cultures, homelands, and identities of Pacific peoples are not sacrificed to the interests of the fossil fuel industry.

From the halls of COP24 to the shores of the Pacific, the demand is the same: end coal, accelerate a just transition to renewable energy, and act now so that vulnerable communities can not only survive, but thrive.
