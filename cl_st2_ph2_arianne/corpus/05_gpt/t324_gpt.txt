The Karipuna Indigenous Peoples in Brazil are engaged in a critical struggle to defend their officially recognized territory from land-grabbers who invade to log the forest and clear land for cattle farming. Their lands, which should be protected under Brazilian law, are being carved up and exploited through illegal activities that directly threaten both their community and the ecosystems they depend on.

In response, the Karipuna have taken their fight far beyond the borders of their territory. They have spoken at the United Nations, bringing international attention to the destruction occurring on their lands and the risks they face. They have also worked with partner organizations to monitor deforestation, documenting the scale and speed of forest loss. Through these efforts, they have consistently denounced government inaction and called for real protection on the ground.

A central issue in this conflict is the misuse of Brazil’s Rural Environmental Registry, known as CAR. This system, intended to register rural properties and support environmental regulation, has been used to illegally register areas inside the Karipuna’s protected territory. These fraudulent registrations have then enabled land-grabbers to clear forest and introduce cattle grazing in areas that should be strictly protected. The existence of these illegal registrations, combined with the absence of an effective protection plan from the authorities, has left the Karipuna territory exposed to escalating invasions.

As a result, their land was ranked among Brazil’s ten most destroyed Indigenous territories in the last year. This ranking reflects not only the intensity of deforestation, but also the failure of state institutions to uphold Indigenous rights and environmental law where they are most urgently needed.

The Karipuna are now suing the Brazilian state for allowing these illegal land registrations and for failing to protect their territory. By taking legal action, they are demanding accountability for the misuse of the CAR registry and for the broader pattern of state negligence that has opened the door to land-grabbers. Their lawsuit is both a defense of their own rights and a challenge to the structural mechanisms that enable deforestation in protected areas.

The situation has worsened in the context of national policies. Since 2019, under President Jair Bolsonaro’s openly anti-environmental agenda, deforestation across Brazil has surged. In this political climate, environmental protections have been weakened, oversight has declined, and illegal activities have flourished. For Indigenous communities like the Karipuna, this has translated into increased threats to their lives, their culture, and the forests that sustain them.

The struggle of the Karipuna is not only a local or national issue. Protecting their rights and their territory is inseparable from global efforts to confront the climate crisis. The forests they are defending store vast amounts of carbon and harbor critical biodiversity. When these forests are destroyed, carbon is released into the atmosphere, accelerating climate change and undermining international climate goals.

Supporting the Karipuna’s fight—respecting their rights, ensuring the integrity of their territory, and challenging the systems that enable illegal deforestation—is therefore essential for safeguarding both human rights and the global climate. Their defense of their land is also a defense of a stable climate for everyone.
