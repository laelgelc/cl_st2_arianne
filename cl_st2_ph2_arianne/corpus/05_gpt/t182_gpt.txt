The latest report from the IPCC’s Working Group III makes one thing unmistakably clear: we already have powerful climate solutions that can dramatically cut emissions this decade. In an interview, Greenpeace scientist Reyes Tirado explains that if these solutions are deployed at scale, global emissions could be halved by 2030, often at low cost and with huge co-benefits for people and nature.

According to Tirado, some of the most impactful measures are already well known. Rapidly expanding renewable energy is central: technologies like wind and solar are mature, increasingly affordable, and ready to replace fossil fuels in power systems. At the same time, halting deforestation and protecting remaining forests and other ecosystems are critical, both for storing carbon and for safeguarding biodiversity.

Tirado emphasizes that ecosystem protection must go hand in hand with respecting Indigenous rights. Indigenous Peoples are among the most effective guardians of forests and other vital ecosystems, and any climate strategy that ignores their rights and leadership is not only unjust but also less effective.

Another major piece of the puzzle is transforming food systems. The report highlights that shifting to more plant-based diets can significantly reduce emissions, especially by cutting back on industrial livestock production. Reducing demand for meat and dairy from intensive systems eases pressure on land, lowers methane emissions, and can free up space for nature restoration.

Despite the availability of these solutions, Tirado warns that current government policies are steering the world toward failure. Without immediate and far-reaching action, the trajectory leads toward an unlivable future for many communities and ecosystems. Governments are still allowing the expansion of fossil fuels instead of planning their phase-out, and public and private finance continues to flow into polluting industries rather than into climate-safe, equitable solutions.

Key steps outlined include phasing out fossil fuels as quickly as possible, protecting and restoring ecosystems while upholding Indigenous rights, reducing industrial livestock production through dietary shifts, and redirecting financial flows toward climate solutions that also advance justice and equity.

Tirado stresses that this is not only a technical or policy challenge but also a political one. To change course, broad public mobilization is essential. She points to the power of protests, voting, and collective action to push leaders to adopt the ambitious measures the science demands. Individual choices matter too, especially when they reinforce systemic change: switching to renewable energy where possible, adopting low-meat or plant-based diets, and supporting movements and policies that prioritize climate and social justice.

The message is urgent but not hopeless. The tools to avert the worst outcomes are already in our hands. What is needed now is the courage and determination—from governments, institutions, and people everywhere—to use them at the scale and speed the IPCC says is still within reach.
