Every year, as summer draws to a close, the Arctic sea ice shrinks to its smallest size. This “sea ice minimum” is a critical moment for the planet, and this year it could be among the lowest ever recorded. Greenpeace is heading to the Arctic to document and bear witness to this moment on the frontline of the climate crisis.

The loss of sea ice is a stark sign of climate breakdown and its accelerating impact on our oceans and the wildlife that depends on them. As the ice retreats, it is not just a warning signal—it is also opening up the region to new industrial pressures. Melting ice is enabling new shipping routes and paving the way for more industrial activities in previously inaccessible areas, adding further threats to already stressed ocean ecosystems.

Scientists now predict that the Arctic could be effectively free of sea ice in summer by 2035. That timeline underlines just how urgent it is to act. Protecting the oceans is no longer something that can be postponed to the distant future; it is something that must happen this decade.

One of the most powerful tools available is the new Global Ocean Treaty. If properly implemented, it can help protect 30% of the world’s oceans by 2030. That level of protection would be a lifeline for marine life and a crucial buffer against escalating climate impacts. But treaties only work if governments feel the pressure to turn words into action.

That is why Greenpeace is calling on people everywhere to support the Global Ocean Treaty by signing a petition demanding that leaders protect at least 30% of the oceans by 2030. Public pressure is essential to ensure that promises translate into real protections in the water.

As this Arctic expedition unfolds, Greenpeace is inviting people to follow along on Instagram to see what is happening at the edge of the ice in real time. The images and stories from the journey will show what is at stake—and why this fragile region needs protection now.
