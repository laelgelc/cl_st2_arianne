Danicley de Aguiar left his home state of Pará, in the Brazilian Amazon, and traveled all the way to South Korea with a clear message: the Amazon rainforest and its Indigenous Peoples cannot keep paying the price of illegal gold mining.

For decades, mining has carved scars into the forest. Over the last 36 years, more than 200,000 hectares of the Amazon have been destroyed by mining activities. This devastation is not just about trees being cut down. It is about rivers poisoned by mercury, communities exposed to disease, forest landscapes fragmented and degraded, and the climate crisis deepening as one of the world’s most important carbon stores is systematically damaged.

Indigenous Peoples like the Kayapó, Munduruku, and Yanomami are on the frontline of this destruction. Their territories, which should be among the most protected areas in the Amazon, have been invaded by illegal miners who bring violence, pollution, and social disruption. Mercury used in gold extraction contaminates water and fish, entering the food chain and threatening the health and survival of Indigenous communities. Mining camps and invasions also spread diseases and intensify conflicts, further undermining Indigenous rights and ways of life.

In recent years, the scale and speed of this destruction have been supercharged by a specific piece of heavy machinery: the hydraulic excavator. These machines can rip through forest and riverbanks at a pace that manual methods never could, turning what were once gradual incursions into rapid, industrial-scale devastation. In Indigenous Territories, the arrival of hydraulic excavators has drastically accelerated forest loss and environmental damage.

A Greenpeace investigation revealed how central these machines have become to illegal mining in the Brazilian Amazon. Between 2021 and 2023, Greenpeace documented 176 hydraulic excavators operating illegally in Indigenous Territories. Of these, 75 were manufactured by Hyundai’s Brazilian subsidiary. Many of the machines were sold through dealerships located close to the areas where illegal mining is expanding, linking corporate supply chains directly to the frontlines of forest destruction.

This connection between global machinery manufacturers and local environmental crime exposes a critical responsibility. Companies like Hyundai cannot ignore how and where their products are being used when the consequences are so severe. The damage goes far beyond the immediate mining sites: deforestation and river contamination undermine biodiversity, destroy habitats, and release greenhouse gases that worsen the global climate crisis.

Danicley’s journey to South Korea was about making this responsibility visible. By standing in front of Hyundai in its home country, he carried the voices of the Kayapó, Munduruku, Yanomami, and many others whose territories and lives are being torn apart by illegal gold mining powered by heavy machinery.

Hyundai has the technology and capacity to act. The company can use monitoring systems and digital tools already common in the heavy machinery sector to track where its excavators are operating, identify suspicious or illegal use, and prevent its equipment from being deployed in Indigenous Territories and other protected areas. By implementing effective monitoring and control measures, Hyundai can help stop its machines from fueling illegal mining and contribute to protecting the Amazon and its peoples.

The Amazon is vital for climate stability, biodiversity, and the survival of countless communities. Stopping illegal mining in Indigenous Territories is essential for safeguarding this forest. When companies take responsibility for how their products are used, they can help close the space in which environmental crime thrives. Danicley’s message in South Korea is clear: protecting the Amazon is a global duty, and Hyundai must be part of the solution.
