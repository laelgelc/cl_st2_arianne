On 31 July, streets, walls, and public spaces in 25 cities around the world became canvases for a powerful message: people are holding the oil industry accountable for the climate crisis.

From the Philippines to New Zealand, activists took part in a peaceful People vs. Oil solidarity action, putting up posters and street art that cut through the fossil fuel industry’s glossy advertising. Instead of the familiar greenwashed slogans and polished PR, passersby were confronted with stark images of what the climate crisis really looks like: intensified forest fires, hurricanes, cyclones, heavy rainfall, and extreme temperatures.

These visuals spoke directly to the fear, anxiety, and grief that so many people feel as the climate crisis accelerates. The artworks declared that climate anxiety, breakdown, and grief are “proudly brought to you” by the fossil fuel industry, calling out the role of oil companies in driving the crisis while they continue to promote misleading ads about their so-called solutions.

By reclaiming public space, activists challenged the narrative that the oil industry is part of a sustainable future. Instead, the posters and street art carried a clear message: the age of oil must end. Alongside the images and slogans, they called on people everywhere to join the fight, to stand together in solidarity, and to help bring about the end of the oil age.
