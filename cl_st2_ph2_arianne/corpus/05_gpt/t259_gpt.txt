Thirty years ago, governments came together to do something extraordinary: they agreed to protect Antarctica from oil drilling and mining. Through the 1991 Madrid Protocol, they drew a line in the ice and said that this unique place on Earth should not be sacrificed for fossil fuels and minerals. Greenpeace’s campaigns, and the establishment of a base on the frozen continent to join negotiations, helped ensure that protection won.

That moment offers powerful lessons for today. It showed that when people and governments respect planetary boundaries, they can make decisions that put the health of our planet ahead of short-term profit. It also showed that collaboration works: campaigners, scientists, communities and decision-makers can come together to defend the natural world.

But the story of Antarctica is far from over. The continent and the oceans that surround it are now under mounting pressure from climate change, pollution and destructive fishing. Warming waters and changing ice conditions are reshaping habitats. Pollution is reaching even these remote ecosystems. At the same time, industrial fishing threatens to strip away the very foundations of Antarctic food webs.

Penguins, some of the most iconic inhabitants of this region, are already feeling the impacts. Their populations are declining as the environment they depend on becomes less stable and less abundant. When penguins struggle, it is a warning sign that the wider Antarctic ecosystem is in trouble.

The decisions made by the Antarctic Ocean Commission in the coming years will be critical. This body has the power to put meaningful protection in place by prioritizing the creation of ocean sanctuaries. Properly protected areas in the Southern Ocean would give penguins, whales, krill and countless other species the space they need to feed, breed and adapt to a rapidly changing climate.

Protection in Antarctica is closely tied to what happens on the global stage. At the United Nations, governments are negotiating a Global Ocean Treaty that could transform how we care for the high seas. A strong treaty would make it possible to create large-scale protected areas across international waters, helping to halt biodiversity loss and give marine life a chance to recover.

Such a treaty is also about justice. Healthy oceans support the livelihoods, cultures and food security of coastal communities around the world. By safeguarding marine ecosystems, a robust Global Ocean Treaty can help ensure that the benefits of thriving oceans are shared fairly and sustainably.

Nearly four million people have already raised their voices, urging world leaders to protect at least 30% of the world’s oceans by 2030. This global call for action echoes the spirit of the Antarctic victory three decades ago. Then, as now, people demanded that governments act with courage and foresight.

The choice facing leaders today is clear. They can ignore the warning signs from Antarctica and allow climate change, pollution and destructive fishing to push fragile ecosystems closer to collapse. Or they can learn from the success of the Madrid Protocol, respect planetary boundaries, and work together to protect the oceans that sustain life on Earth.

The world has already shown that it can come together to defend Antarctica from drilling and mining. Now it must do so again—this time to secure strong ocean sanctuaries in the Southern Ocean, and a powerful Global Ocean Treaty that protects at least 30% of our oceans by 2030.
