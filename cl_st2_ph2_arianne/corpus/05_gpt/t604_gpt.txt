In southeast Siberia, in Russia’s Zabaikalsky krai, wildfires have left a trail of destruction: homes and farms reduced to ash, livestock lost, 34 people injured and one person killed. The scale of the damage has forced authorities to declare a state of emergency. Behind each of these numbers are families who have lost everything, and communities now facing an uncertain future.

Greenpeace Russia’s firefighting team, led by Grigory Kuksin, has been working on the ground to support people in some of the most remote and affected areas. The team has delivered humanitarian aid including burn-treatment bandages, supplies for firefighters, and basic essentials like clothes and food to families who suddenly find themselves without shelter or livelihoods.

Kuksin describes arriving in settlements where only smoldering ruins remain, with blackened prairies stretching into the distance. Strong winds helped the flames race across the landscape at frightening speed, leaving people with almost no time to react. In many cases, the fires begin with human actions, including arson, before being driven out of control by the weather and dry conditions.

These fires are not inevitable. They are often the direct result of human behavior, and that means prevention is possible. Simple actions can stop a spark from becoming a catastrophe: fully extinguishing cigarettes, never leaving campfires unattended, and making absolutely sure any fire is completely out before leaving an area. Carelessness in dry, windy conditions can destroy entire communities in a matter of hours.

As the people of Zabaikalsky krai try to recover, they need urgent support. Donations can help provide emergency supplies, support firefighting efforts, and assist families who have lost their homes and livelihoods.
