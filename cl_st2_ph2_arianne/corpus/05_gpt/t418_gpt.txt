On industrial fishing vessels across the world’s oceans, many migrant fishers from Southeast Asia are living a reality that looks nothing like the better life they were promised. Instead of decent work and fair pay, they often face harsh, dangerous conditions that resemble modern slavery: extremely long working hours, physical and verbal abuse, and, in some tragic cases, death at sea.

These workers board vessels with hopes of supporting their families and building more secure futures. Once at sea, however, those hopes are frequently crushed by exploitation and fear. Many are pushed to work to the point of exhaustion, denied basic rights, or trapped in situations where speaking out could cost them their livelihoods—or worse. The isolation of life on distant-water fishing vessels only deepens their vulnerability, leaving them far from help and far from home.

Greenpeace East Asia and Greenpeace Southeast Asia have documented these abuses through extensive investigations, uncovering real stories of Indonesian fishers who endured such conditions. Drawing from this evidence, Greenpeace has produced two powerful films, shot in Taiwan and featuring real Indonesian workers. These films do not use actors or fictional scenarios; they are based on true accounts gathered during the investigations.

In the films, fishers describe the grim reality of their lives at sea: unfair treatment by superiors, inhumane working conditions, and the constant pressure to endure whatever happens on board. Their stories reveal not only the brutality of the system but also the deeply personal motivations that led them there—especially the desire to provide for parents, spouses, and children back home. These personal sacrifices and hopes stand in stark contrast to the exploitation they experience.

More than 30 workers were interviewed in the course of Greenpeace’s work. Many of them expressed a clear and present fear: if they complain, they could lose their jobs. This fear keeps them silent and allows abusive practices to continue unchecked. It is a reminder that behind every cheap or untraceable piece of seafood may be a worker who felt they had no choice but to endure abuse.

Consumers are not powerless in the face of this injustice. The choices made at supermarket shelves and restaurant tables can help shift the industry. Choosing sustainable seafood—backed by credible standards, traceability, and strong human rights protections—can support better practices at sea. Just as importantly, raising awareness about the human cost behind industrial fishing can increase pressure on companies and governments to act.

By listening to fishers’ stories and sharing them widely, people everywhere can help expose the hidden abuses in industrial fishing and support efforts to ensure that the ocean economy does not depend on exploitation.
