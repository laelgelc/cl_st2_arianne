Our oceans are often spoken about as if they are just home to whales, turtles, and coral reefs. But protecting the ocean is also about protecting people. More than 3 billion people around the world rely on the ocean for their livelihoods, food, and cultural identity. For many coastal communities, especially in the Global South, the sea is not a distant landscape – it is daily life, history, and survival.

Yet destructive industries are pushing both ocean ecosystems and the people who depend on them to the edge. Industrial fishing fleets are stripping the seas of life, emptying fish stocks that local communities have depended on for generations. This isn’t an abstract problem – it shows up in the lives of real people.

Think of a small-scale fisher in Nigeria who can no longer catch enough fish to cover the rising cost of living or to keep their children in school. Where there was once enough catch to sustain a family, industrial vessels now dominate the waters, taking more than the ocean can replenish. As fish populations decline, so do incomes, food security, and the possibility of a dignified future for coastal families.

The harm doesn’t stop at the shoreline. Out at sea, many migrant workers on industrial fishing vessels face harsh and exploitative conditions. Reports from across the world describe workers forced into extremely long shifts, enduring violence and abuse, with little power to challenge what’s happening to them. The same system that treats the ocean as a bottomless resource often treats workers as disposable.

At the same time, our oceans are doing vital work in the fight against climate change. They absorb between 20–30% of human-made carbon dioxide emissions, helping to buffer us from even more extreme global heating. But this natural protection is not guaranteed. The more we exploit and damage marine ecosystems, the less able the ocean is to keep performing this life-supporting role.

Ocean protection, then, is not a luxury or a niche environmental issue. It is about defending food security, jobs, cultures, and human rights – especially for communities that have contributed least to the climate crisis yet are paying the highest price. Safeguarding the high seas means safeguarding people.

That’s why a strong Global Ocean Treaty is essential. A robust treaty can put in place protections for the high seas – the vast areas of ocean beyond national borders – to limit destructive activities and help restore marine life. It can be a critical step toward ensuring that the benefits of the ocean are shared fairly and that coastal and fishing communities are not sacrificed for short-term profit.

You can help. Add your name to the call for a Global Ocean Treaty that defends both the ocean and the people who depend on it.
