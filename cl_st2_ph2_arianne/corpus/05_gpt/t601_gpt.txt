Imagine waking up in a world where the energy that powers your lights, your bus ride, your hospital, and your school comes entirely from the wind, the sun, and the power of the earth itself. The air is cleaner, the water safer, and the economy is built around repairing damage, restoring ecosystems, and ensuring everyone has what they need to live with dignity. This is a world fully powered by renewable energy, where sustainable development is not a slogan but the way everything works.

In this world, communities on the frontlines of climate impacts are not left to fend for themselves. There is funding and support for a just recovery from climate disasters—so when storms, floods, or fires hit, people are not abandoned in the aftermath. Recovery is not just about rebuilding what was lost, but rebuilding better: safer homes, resilient infrastructure, and fairer economic systems that reduce future risk rather than deepen existing inequalities.

Crucially, people and regions that have long depended on fossil fuels are not treated as collateral damage in the transition. Workers in coal, oil, and gas, and the communities built around those industries, receive real support to shift into new, sustainable livelihoods. Training, investment, and social protections ensure that the move away from fossil fuels does not mean mass unemployment or abandoned towns, but a managed, fair transition where no one is sacrificed for the sake of change.

This kind of transformation is at the heart of the Green New Deal, introduced in the United States by Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Senator Ed Markey. Far from being only a partisan project, the Green New Deal is a vision of equality and climate action that reaches beyond traditional political divides. It is backed by a majority of people in the US, including many conservatives, who recognize that a livable planet and a fair economy are not left-wing or right-wing issues—they are basic conditions for survival and justice.

The Green New Deal is not perfect. To meet the scale of the climate crisis, it needs to go further in phasing out fossil fuels and stopping the construction of new fossil fuel infrastructure. Without a clear and rapid end to coal, oil, and gas expansion, even the most ambitious plans for clean energy and jobs will fall short of what science tells us is necessary. But the Green New Deal remains a powerful starting point: it links climate action with economic justice, and it insists that tackling global heating must also mean tackling inequality.

The urgency of this moment is not a matter of opinion; it is grounded in the science summarized by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The IPCC has made it clear that the window to prevent the worst climate impacts is rapidly closing, and that every fraction of a degree of warming we can avoid matters. Delay is not neutral—it locks in more extreme weather, more displacement, and more irreversible damage.

Young people around the world understand this urgency and are refusing to accept a future defined by climate chaos. Global youth movements have taken to the streets, to parliaments, and to international forums, demanding that leaders act in line with what the science requires. Their message is simple and powerful: it is not enough to acknowledge the problem; governments must change course now.

Some governments have begun to formally recognize the scale of the crisis. Countries like Ireland and the United Kingdom have declared a climate emergency, acknowledging that climate breakdown is not a distant threat but a present danger. These declarations are a sign that political systems are starting to catch up with reality—but they only matter if they are followed by concrete action that cuts emissions, supports communities, and ends dependence on fossil fuels.

The cost of inaction is already enormous and will only grow. Failing to act means higher bills for disaster response, infrastructure repair, and health impacts. It means more people forced from their homes by floods, fires, and rising seas. It means deepening economic instability as climate shocks ripple through food systems, supply chains, and financial markets. These costs are not evenly distributed: vulnerable groups—whether because of poverty, race, geography, or historical marginalization—are hit first and hardest.

A different path is possible. A world powered by renewables, built on sustainable development, and committed to justice is within reach. It requires phasing out fossil fuels, stopping new fossil infrastructure, funding just recovery, and supporting workers and communities through the transition. It requires turning declarations of emergency into real, measurable change.

The choice is stark but clear. We can continue on a path of delay and denial, locking in catastrophe and deepening inequality. Or we can embrace a vision like the Green New Deal—imperfect but evolving—that treats climate action as an opportunity to build a fairer, safer world for everyone.
