In Brazil, Indigenous Peoples’ rights and lands are under serious threat. Two major legal moves – the so‑called Marco Temporal loophole and bill PL 490 – could open the door to land theft, industrial exploitation, and further violence against Indigenous communities.

Marco Temporal is a legal interpretation that says Indigenous Peoples can only claim rights to their traditional territories if they can prove they were physically occupying them on the exact date the current Brazilian Constitution was enacted in 1988. This ignores the fact that many communities were violently expelled from their lands long before that date, and that displacement, forced removals, and ongoing threats have shaped where Indigenous Peoples could safely live. By tying land rights to a single moment in time, Marco Temporal risks legalizing past and present land grabs and erasing centuries of Indigenous presence and stewardship.

Bill PL 490 adds another layer of danger. It seeks to open Indigenous territories to industrial agriculture and mining, exposing them to deforestation, pollution, and social conflict. This is especially dangerous for isolated Indigenous communities, whose survival depends on intact forests and minimal outside contact. Allowing large-scale agribusiness and mining into these areas threatens their lands, their health, and their right to live according to their own ways of life.

These attacks on Indigenous rights are unfolding in the broader context of Bolsonaro’s Brazil, where the pressure to exploit forests and natural resources has intensified. Indigenous territories are among the most effective barriers against deforestation, and Indigenous Peoples are widely recognized as forest guardians. Weakening their rights and opening their lands to destructive industries undermines both human rights and the protection of the Amazon and other vital ecosystems.

Greenpeace supports the defense of Indigenous Peoples’ rights and territories, and stands with the organizations and communities resisting these rollbacks. The Articulation of Indigenous Peoples of Brazil (APIB) is at the forefront of this struggle. APIB has called on Brazil’s Supreme Court to declare the Marco Temporal thesis unconstitutional. The Court’s proceedings on this crucial issue are set to resume on August 25, a key moment that will help determine the future of Indigenous territories in the country.

The stakes have already been made painfully clear on the streets. In June 2021, Indigenous protesters who gathered in Brasília to defend their rights faced violence. Their mobilization shows both the determination of Indigenous Peoples to protect their lands and the risks they face when they stand up against policies like Marco Temporal and PL 490.

Defending Indigenous territories in Brazil is not only about legal arguments and court dates. It is about protecting communities who have cared for their lands for generations, safeguarding forests that are essential for the climate, and rejecting laws and loopholes that legitimize land theft and environmental destruction. Greenpeace continues to support Indigenous Peoples in this struggle and to call for respect for their rights, lands, and role as guardians of the forest.
