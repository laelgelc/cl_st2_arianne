Earth’s living web is unraveling. Across forests, oceans, grasslands and rivers, life is collapsing under the weight of human pressures in a way that mirrors the great mass extinctions of the past. Species are vanishing, ecosystems are degrading, and the intricate relationships that sustain life are breaking down.

This isn’t an abstract loss. Nature is the foundation of our daily survival. It provides the food we eat, the air we breathe, and the water we drink. Healthy ecosystems regulate our climate, cycle nutrients through soils and seas, and buffer us from floods, storms and other disasters. They help protect us from diseases, offer the raw materials and inspiration for medical breakthroughs, and nourish our spirits, cultures and identities. When biodiversity collapses, all of these life-support systems are weakened or lost.

At the heart of this crisis is an economic system built on extraction and endless growth. Extractive capitalism treats nature as a warehouse of commodities rather than a living community we depend on. Destructive industries – from fossil fuels to industrial farming and other large-scale exploitative activities – tear through forests, poison rivers and oceans, exhaust soils and destabilize the climate. Governments, instead of confronting these harms, too often prioritize corporate profits and short-term gains over real solutions, allowing the destruction to accelerate.

This trajectory is neither inevitable nor acceptable. To pull back from the brink, we need to fundamentally rethink how we produce and consume. That means moving away from models that deplete land, water and energy, and towards systems that respect ecological limits and restore damaged ecosystems. It means challenging the power of polluting industries and rejecting the idea that economic growth must come at the expense of the living world.

A crucial step is to secure strong protections for nature on a global scale. Safeguarding at least 30% of the world’s lands and oceans by 2030 is a key milestone. But protection on paper is not enough. These efforts must be built in genuine partnership with Indigenous Peoples and local communities, whose knowledge, stewardship and rights are essential to keeping ecosystems healthy and resilient. Where Indigenous rights are respected and their leadership recognized, biodiversity tends to thrive.

Ambitious global agreements are central to this transformation. International processes such as the Convention on Biological Diversity’s COP15 are critical opportunities to commit to real action that can restore balance between human societies and the rest of the living world. These agreements must go beyond vague promises and set clear, enforceable targets to halt biodiversity loss, phase out destructive practices, and channel resources into restoration and community-led protection.

The collapse of biodiversity is a warning that the way we live is out of balance with the planet that sustains us. Choosing a different path – one that values nature for all it gives us and respects the communities who defend it – is not just about saving species. It is about securing a livable, resilient future for everyone.
