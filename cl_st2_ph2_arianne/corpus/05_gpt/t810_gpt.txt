Greenpeace Nordic confirms with heavy hearts that our colleague Carolina Nyberg-Steiser, 29, died in a tragic small amphibious plane crash while landing on the Rio Negro near Manaus, Brazil, on Tuesday at 11:50 AM local time.

Carolina was visiting our Brazil office to meet colleagues, learn more about the Amazon protection campaign, and witness the forest firsthand. During this visit, she joined a flight over the region that ended in the fatal crash. The pilot and three other Greenpeace Brazil passengers survived with light injuries.

At this time, there are no confirmed details about the cause of the crash. Out of respect for Carolina’s family, we are not providing further comments.

Carolina is deeply missed by her colleagues. Our thoughts are with her family.
