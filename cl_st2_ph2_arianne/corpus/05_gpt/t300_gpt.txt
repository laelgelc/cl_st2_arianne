In September 2021, Greenpeace marked 50 years since a small group of activists set out from Vancouver to confront a U.S. nuclear bomb test at Amchitka, Alaska. That journey, and the people behind it, gave birth to a global environmental organization whose name and spirit were forged in a unique moment of social upheaval and hope.

In the late 1960s, Vancouver became a gathering place for people resisting war, injustice, and environmental destruction. Peace activists, ecologists, and U.S. draft resisters found one another in a city alive with anti-war protests, civil rights struggles, and a growing awareness that the planet itself was under threat. Among them were Irving and Dorothy Stowe, Bob Hunter, Ben and Dorothy Metcalfe, Jim and Marie Bohlen, and Bill Darnell. They came from different backgrounds but shared a conviction that ordinary people could stand up to the most powerful forces on Earth.

The U.S. government’s plan to test a nuclear bomb at Amchitka Island, off Alaska, became a focal point for their concern. The test symbolized the dangers of nuclear weapons and the disregard for fragile ecosystems. Inspired by Quaker actions that used non-violent witness and direct presence to challenge injustice, the group decided they would not simply protest from afar. They would sail directly into the test zone, placing themselves in harm’s way to confront the explosion and draw the world’s attention.

To organize this bold act, they formed the Don’t Make a Wave Committee. The name captured their fear that the blast could trigger earthquakes or tsunamis, but also their determination to stop a political and moral shockwave from spreading unchecked. As they prepared to charter a boat and set sail, they searched for words that could unite their deepest values.

The name “Greenpeace” emerged from that search. It brought together two ideas that had often been treated separately: the struggle for peace and the struggle to protect the living world. “Green” spoke to ecology and the Earth’s fragile systems; “peace” spoke to an end to war, nuclear threats, and violence. Merging the two into one word expressed the insight that peace among people and peace with the planet are inseparable.

From that first campaign against the Amchitka nuclear test, Greenpeace grew into an organization recognized around the world. Its origins remain rooted in that 1960s Vancouver convergence of peace activists, ecologists, and draft resisters, and in the decision by a small group of people to sail into danger under a new name that captured their shared vision: Greenpeace.
