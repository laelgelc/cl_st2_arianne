Hidden beneath the waves, seamounts are towering underwater volcanic mountains that act as wildlife magnets. By pushing nutrient-rich waters up from the deep seafloor, they create thriving hotspots of life in the open ocean. These places can be teeming with marine biodiversity, from tiny plankton to larger predators, all drawn by the abundance of food.

Many of these seamounts lie in the high seas – waters beyond national borders. Out here, protection is difficult. Regulatory gaps allow destructive industries to exploit these fragile ecosystems with little oversight. This lack of effective rules means vulnerable habitats and species are left exposed to overfishing and pollution.

Mount Vema is a powerful example. Rising an incredible 4,600 metres from the seafloor – roughly the height of 767 giraffes stacked on top of each other – it’s a dramatic underwater mountain in the open ocean. It was discovered in 1957/1959 during a search for diamonds, but instead of precious stones, industrial interests found Tristan rock lobsters. These lobsters were fished so heavily that the population was overexploited, showing just how quickly commercial pressure can damage a once-abundant ecosystem.

Today, Mount Vema is scarred by human activity. The seamount is now littered with ghost fishing gear – lost or abandoned nets and lines that continue to trap and kill marine life long after they’ve been discarded. This silent, ongoing destruction adds to the pressure on already stressed species and habitats.

Greenpeace is campaigning for a strong global ocean treaty that can close these loopholes and create effective protection for high seas ecosystems like Mount Vema. Such a treaty would make it possible to establish large-scale marine protected areas far from shore, putting vulnerable wildlife hotspots off-limits to harmful industrial activities.

As part of a pole-to-pole journey, Greenpeace is documenting ocean biodiversity and the threats it faces, including at places like Mount Vema. By gathering evidence from these remote seamounts, the campaign aims to show why a robust global treaty is urgently needed to safeguard the oceans that all life depends on.
