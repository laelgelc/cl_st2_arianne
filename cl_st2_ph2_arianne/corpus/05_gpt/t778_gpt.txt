Love is in the air this Valentine’s Day – and under the ice, on the waves, and deep in the Southern Ocean. Antarctica might seem like a frozen wilderness, but it’s also home to some of the most devoted, surprising and downright heart‑warming love stories on Earth.

Take Adélie penguins, for example. In a landscape of snow and rock, romance begins with a simple gift: a pebble. Adélie penguins present carefully chosen rocks to their mates, helping them build sturdy nests that will keep their eggs and chicks safe from the harsh Antarctic elements. These little tokens aren’t just practical; they’re a way of saying “you and our future family matter.”

Out at sea, the largest animals on the planet are making epic journeys for love. Blue whales – whose hearts are literally the size of gorillas – migrate to breed and raise their young. After giving birth, mothers nurse their calves with extraordinary devotion, going for long periods without eating as they help their young grow strong enough to survive the vast Southern Ocean.

Beneath the waves, Turquet’s octopuses carry their own symbols of devotion. They have three hearts, and their gentle, enveloping hugs are a kind of underwater embrace. These remarkable animals also carry clues in their DNA that help scientists understand how Earth’s climate has changed in the past, adding another layer of meaning to their presence in Antarctic waters.

High above the ocean, albatross glide on the winds for thousands of kilometres, but always return to the one they love. Many albatross mate for life, forming partnerships that can last up to 60 years. Year after year, they reunite at the same nesting sites to raise their chicks together, sharing the work of incubating eggs and finding food for their young.

Even tiny Antarctic krill have their own dramatic love lives. Deep below the surface, they mate in a swift, choreographed sequence sometimes described as “chase, probe, embrace, flex & push.” It’s over in moments, but it’s vital to the survival of the countless animals – from whales to penguins – that depend on krill as a crucial food source.

All of these stories of care, commitment and connection are unfolding in one of the most fragile places on Earth. This Valentine’s Day, we can show our love in return by helping protect the Antarctic home these animals depend on.

Join the call for an Antarctic Ocean Sanctuary to safeguard these extraordinary species and the wild, icy world they share.
