Greenpeace USA has evaluated 17 of the world’s major smartphone, tablet, and PC manufacturers on how they are addressing three critical environmental challenges: transitioning to renewable energy, reducing resource consumption, and eliminating hazardous chemicals from their products and supply chains.

The assessment shows a mixed picture. Apple stands out for its progress toward 100% renewable energy across its supply chain, demonstrating that large tech companies can move quickly when they choose to. In contrast, major competitors like Samsung and Huawei are lagging behind, particularly in how they report their greenhouse gas emissions and outline plans to cut them. This lack of transparency makes it harder for the public to see whether these companies are doing their fair share to tackle the climate crisis.

On resource use and e-waste, the findings highlight that some companies are beginning to design products that last longer and are easier to repair. Fairphone, Dell, and HP are among the leaders in creating more durable and repairable devices—an important step in reducing the huge volumes of electronic waste generated every year. However, across the sector, many manufacturers are still failing to move away from hazardous chemicals such as PVC (polyvinyl chloride) and BFRs (brominated flame retardants), which can pose risks to both people and the environment throughout a product’s life cycle.

Overall, the results are sobering. The average grade across the 17 companies was just a D+, with Fairphone receiving the highest mark at a B. This underlines how far the electronics industry still has to go to align its practices with the needs of the planet.

The findings are being used to re-launch Greenpeace’s Guide to Greener Electronics, providing people with information on how major brands are performing on key environmental issues. The guide is also a tool to encourage public pressure. People are being urged to take action by tweeting directly at companies such as Samsung, Huawei, and Amazon, calling on them to cut their climate emissions, design longer-lasting and repairable products, and phase out hazardous chemicals. By sharing facts about the environmental impact of electronics and mobilizing public voices online, the campaign aims to push these powerful companies to raise their standards and reduce the industry’s overall footprint.
