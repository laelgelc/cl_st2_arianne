In Wentworth, in the heart of the South Durban Basin, the air people breathe is making them sick. For decades, communities here have lived in the shadow of refineries like Engen and SAPREF, and the cost has been measured in hospital visits, funerals, and futures cut short.

Research from the University of KwaZulu-Natal has confirmed what residents have been saying for years: the pollution in this area is driving extremely high rates of asthma, cancer, and leukemia in children. These are not isolated cases or rare tragedies—they are patterns that map directly onto the smokestacks and flare stacks towering over homes, schools, and playgrounds.

The damage does not stop with one generation. Pollution is triggering epigenetic changes in exposed people—alterations in how genes are expressed—which can increase susceptibility to disease and be passed down. This means that children and even grandchildren may bear the health consequences of decisions made by oil companies and regulators today.

For families like that of Wentworth resident Shareeza Domingo, these impacts are daily realities. Chronic health issues shape every aspect of life, from the ability to work to the simple act of walking outside. Illness is layered on top of already harsh conditions: poverty, high unemployment, and social problems like violence. The community is forced to fight for survival on multiple fronts at once, with pollution deepening every existing inequality.

In this context, the refineries’ presence is experienced not as development, but as a form of sacrifice—where the community’s health is the price paid for corporate profit. Activists, including long-time community leader Desmond D’Sa, are refusing to accept this as inevitable. They are demanding accountability and compensation from the oil companies whose operations have poisoned the air and harmed generations of residents.

Their struggle is made harder by lax regulations that allow companies to operate with far fewer constraints than they would face in wealthier or more politically powerful areas. At the same time, these companies are planning to abandon their sites, leaving behind a toxic legacy, while there are looming threats of further drilling and fossil fuel expansion elsewhere.

The people of Wentworth are insisting that their lives, their health, and their children’s futures must matter more than short-term profit. Their demands are clear: justice for the damage already done, protection from further harm, and an end to treating communities like theirs as expendable.
