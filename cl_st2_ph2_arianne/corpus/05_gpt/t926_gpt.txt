Our oceans are in crisis. Every year, around eight million tonnes of plastic enter the sea, turning once-vibrant waters into a vast “plastic soup.” This growing tide of waste is not just an eyesore – it is a direct threat to marine life and to the health of the ecosystems we all depend on.

Most of this pollution comes from disposable plastics designed to be used once and thrown away. Instead of disappearing, these items persist in the environment for years. Over time, sunlight and waves break them into smaller and smaller pieces called microplastics. These tiny fragments spread throughout the ocean and can end up in the food chain. Microplastics have been found in fish and even in sea salt, showing how deeply they have infiltrated marine ecosystems.

Larger plastic items are just as deadly. Seabirds, fish, turtles, and whales can mistake plastic for food, filling their stomachs with material they cannot digest. Others become fatally entangled in discarded packaging, bags, and fishing-related debris. Whether through ingestion or entanglement, plastic is killing marine animals on a massive scale.

Confronting this crisis starts with a simple principle: Reduce, Reuse, Recycle. Reducing how much plastic we use in the first place is the most effective step, followed by reusing what we already have and recycling what we cannot avoid. Each of us can help cut the flow of plastic into the ocean through everyday choices.

There are five concrete actions you can take:

First, refuse single-use plastics like bags, straws, and other disposable items whenever you can. Choosing reusable alternatives stops waste before it starts.

Second, avoid cosmetics and personal care products that contain microbeads. These tiny plastic particles wash straight down the drain and into waterways, eventually reaching the sea.

Third, buy plastics responsibly and make sure they are recycled. If your community lacks proper recycling facilities, add your voice to calls for better systems so that less plastic ends up in landfills or the ocean.

Fourth, take part in beach cleans. Removing litter from coastlines prevents it from being washed back out to sea and helps protect local wildlife.

Finally, encourage others to join in. Talk with friends, family, and your wider community about plastic pollution and the steps everyone can take. Collective action is essential to turning the tide on the plastic that is choking our oceans.
