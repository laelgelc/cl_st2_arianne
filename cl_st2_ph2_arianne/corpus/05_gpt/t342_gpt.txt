For years, shark fin soup has been held up as the main villain behind the slaughter of sharks worldwide. It’s an easy symbol: a luxury dish, a visible fin, and a clear call to ban a single product. But focusing only on shark fin soup hides the real scale and complexity of what’s happening in our oceans.

Every year, an estimated 100 million sharks are killed. Over the last 50 years, this relentless pressure has driven a staggering 70% decline in global shark populations. This isn’t just a crisis for sharks; it’s a crisis for ocean health. As top predators, sharks help keep marine ecosystems in balance. When they disappear, entire food webs can unravel.

The reality is that shark fin soup is just one piece of a much larger, more profitable, and more destructive global industry. Sharks are not only killed for their fins, but also for their meat, oil, and cartilage. Together, these products feed into a global market worth around $1 billion. Shark meat is sold fresh, frozen, or processed; shark liver oil is used in various products; shark cartilage is turned into supplements. These uses are spread across many countries and sectors, far beyond the single image of a bowl of soup.

This wider market is powered by industrial fishing practices that sweep up sharks on a massive scale. Purse seine nets encircle and trap large schools of fish, often catching sharks as bycatch. Longlines stretch for kilometres, bristling with baited hooks that indiscriminately catch sharks along with other species. Trawlers drag heavy nets across the seafloor, destroying habitats and pulling in everything in their path, including sharks. These methods are used in many parts of the world, including by fleets from France, Spain, Iran, Sri Lanka, South Korea, Japan, China, and the United States.

When public debate singles out shark fin soup alone, it narrows our understanding of the problem and unfairly targets specific cultures and communities, rather than the global industrial systems driving shark decline. Blaming one dish allows the wider fishing industry, trade networks, and consumer markets for shark products to remain in the shadows.

To protect sharks and the oceans they help sustain, we need systemic solutions, not scapegoats. That starts with strong catch limits based on science, to ensure shark populations can recover and are not fished beyond their ability to replenish. It also means delivering on the commitment to protect at least 30% of the world’s oceans by 2030, creating safe havens where sharks and other marine life can thrive free from industrial exploitation.

Global shark sanctuaries are another crucial tool, designating large areas where commercial shark fishing is banned altogether. Alongside this, robust import regulations are needed so that countries do not fuel demand for unsustainably caught shark products. Trade rules can help close the loopholes that allow shark meat, oil, and cartilage to flow across borders with little scrutiny.

Sharks are vital to healthy oceans, and healthy oceans are vital for a stable climate and for millions of people who depend on the sea for food and livelihoods. Greenpeace is working to raise awareness of the true drivers of shark decline and to push for the protections that sharks—and our shared oceans—urgently need. Moving beyond a narrow focus on one dish is essential if we are to confront the global industry that is putting sharks, and ocean health, at risk.
