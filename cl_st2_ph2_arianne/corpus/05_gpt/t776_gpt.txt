When I first stepped onto the sand of Amami Oshima, the beauty of the island felt at odds with what I had come to see. From a distance, the beaches still looked postcard-perfect: clear water, gentle waves, white shorelines. But as I walked closer, the reality of the Sanchi tanker oil spill revealed itself in small, grim details.

Scattered along the high-tide line were dark, sticky lumps of oil, half-buried in the sand. They looked almost like stones at first glance, but the smell and the texture told a different story. Each lump was a reminder that the oil that had spilled far away in the East China Sea had finally reached this place, carried silently by currents to a coastline that had done nothing to deserve it.

Among the debris, I found an oil-soaked fishing net washed ashore. The net, once a tool of livelihood, was now saturated with pollution. It was heavy, glistening with oil, and clearly unusable. For the local fishers who depend on healthy seas, this is not just an environmental disaster but a direct blow to their way of life.

The impact on wildlife was impossible to ignore. On the beach lay the body of a streaked shearwater, a seabird that should have been gliding over the waves, not lying motionless in the sand. Nearby, I saw a sea turtle struggling, clearly in distress, appearing to choke. These animals are among the most visible victims, but they represent countless others affected beneath the surface, out of sight.

Clean-up operations were underway, and teams had already collected large amounts of oily waste from the shore. Bags of contaminated debris were stacked and ready for removal. Yet, even as the visible pollution was being gathered, the deeper problem remained. Toxic substances from the oil lingered in the sand and in the marine environment, where they can continue to harm ecosystems long after the last tar ball is removed from the beach.

Standing there, it was clear that as long as our societies remain dependent on fossil fuels, oil spills like this are not accidents in the true sense of the word—they are an inevitable consequence. The Sanchi disaster is one more example of how our current energy and consumption systems push the ocean closer to its limits, adding to existing pressures like overfishing and pollution.

But this does not mean we are powerless. Reducing our reliance on petrochemicals is one place to start. Cutting back on single-use plastics—those items we use for minutes but that persist in the environment for decades—can directly lessen the demand that drives fossil fuel extraction and transport. Choosing to walk or bike when possible not only reduces emissions but also signals a shift away from a fossil fuel–centred lifestyle.

At a broader level, supporting renewable energy is essential. By backing policies, companies, and community projects that accelerate the transition to clean power, we can help prevent future spills and reduce the many other harms tied to oil and gas.

On Amami Oshima, the waves continue to roll in, and the shoreline will, in time, recover some of its former appearance. But appearances can be deceiving. The lesson carried to these shores by the Sanchi spill is clear: the ocean cannot safely bear the burden of our fossil fuel dependence. Changing how we move, consume, and power our lives is no longer just an abstract climate goal—it is a necessary step to protect the seas and the life that depends on them.
