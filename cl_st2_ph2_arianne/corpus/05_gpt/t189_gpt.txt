In Glasgow, during COP26, 22-year-old climate activist Farzana Faruk Jhumu stood among many voices from the Global South who had overcome significant barriers just to be heard. She came not to celebrate global leadership, but to call it out: world leaders were failing to address the climate crisis while continuing to support the fossil fuel industry.

For Jhumu, who organizes with Fridays for Future MAPA (Most Affected People and Areas) and FFF Bangladesh, this failure is not abstract. It is rooted in lived experience and in the stories of communities already on the front lines of climate impacts. She and other activists from the Global South had to navigate visa obstacles, financial constraints, and travel challenges simply to reach COP26. Once there, they watched as the negotiations delivered little progress on crucial issues like climate debt and loss and damage—areas that matter deeply to the people whose homes, livelihoods, and futures are already being hit by climate disasters.

Jhumu’s frustration reflects a wider anger among youth activists: those who have contributed least to the climate crisis are bearing the greatest costs, while wealthy nations and corporations continue with business as usual. She points to the way global leaders talk about ambition and targets, yet still prop up the fossil fuel industry that drives the crisis. In this context, she sees youth advocacy as a powerful force for challenging entrenched systems of oppression, from colonial legacies to corporate power.

Her own path into climate activism began with Cyclone Sidr, a devastating storm that hit Bangladesh when she was a child. The cyclone left a deep impression on her, shaping her understanding of how vulnerable communities are to climate impacts. That early experience grew into a commitment to community work, where she saw firsthand how people organize, support each other, and rebuild in the face of repeated climate shocks.

This grounding in community made her journey to COP26 all the more symbolic. Jhumu travelled there aboard Greenpeace’s iconic ship, the Rainbow Warrior. The voyage itself underscored the urgency of the crisis and the solidarity between movements at sea and on land, connecting frontline communities in Bangladesh to the global climate negotiations in Scotland. For her, arriving at COP by ship was not a spectacle, but a statement: the voices of those most affected will not be kept away from the places where decisions are made.

At COP26, however, the gap between those voices and the outcomes of the talks was stark. Minimal progress on climate debt and loss and damage left many Global South activists feeling sidelined yet again. Jhumu stressed that climate debt is not a metaphor—it is a demand for accountability from the countries and corporations that have historically polluted the most. Loss and damage is not a distant policy term; it is the reality for communities who are losing land, culture, and lives right now.

In response to this ongoing injustice, Jhumu is helping to build power outside the negotiation halls. She is a key voice in promoting the global climate strike on March 25, organized under the banner #PeopleNotProfit. The message is simple and direct: people must come before corporate greed. This call is aimed squarely at a system that continues to prioritize profit over the safety, dignity, and future of millions.

#PeopleNotProfit is more than a slogan. It is a demand for a fundamental shift in whose interests are served by climate policy. Jhumu and her peers are calling for an end to fossil fuel expansion, for real support for communities on the front lines, and for decision-making that centers those who are most affected rather than those who are most powerful. By mobilizing globally on March 25, they aim to show that youth and frontline communities are not waiting for permission from politicians—they are organizing for justice themselves.

In the midst of this intense activism, Jhumu is also candid about the toll it can take. Activist burnout is a real and growing problem, especially for young people who are constantly confronting stories of loss, injustice, and inaction. She talks about burnout not as a personal failure but as a structural issue: when the burden of pushing for change falls on the same communities who are already under pressure, exhaustion is inevitable.

To confront this, Jhumu turns again to community. She emphasizes the importance of mutual care, solidarity, and shared responsibility within movements. Support from peers, time to rest, and spaces to grieve and heal are not luxuries—they are essential to sustaining the struggle for climate justice. By naming burnout and addressing it openly, she helps to build a culture of activism that is resilient, compassionate, and long-term.

Jhumu’s story is one of persistence in the face of systemic injustice. From witnessing Cyclone Sidr as a child, to working with communities in Bangladesh, to sailing on the Rainbow Warrior to challenge world leaders at COP26, she has carried the experiences of the most affected into spaces of global power. Her critique of leaders who continue to back fossil fuels, her insistence on climate debt and loss and damage, and her call for #PeopleNotProfit all reflect a clear message: the climate crisis is inseparable from questions of justice.

As the March 25 global climate strike approaches, Jhumu’s voice is part of a wider chorus demanding that the world choose people over profit. Youth from the Global South and beyond are not only exposing the failures of current leaders—they are also modeling a different way forward, rooted in community, accountability, and care. In their insistence on justice, they are reshaping what climate leadership looks like and who it serves.
