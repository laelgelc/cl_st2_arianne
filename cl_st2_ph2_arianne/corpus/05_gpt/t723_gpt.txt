Around the world, people are raising the alarm about the dangers of oil pipelines. From construction to operation, these projects bring the constant risk of spills that can poison water, harm wildlife, damage ecosystems, and threaten the health and safety of nearby communities. These impacts often fall first and hardest on Indigenous Peoples and rural communities who depend directly on the land and water for their survival and culture.

In North America, several major pipelines have become flashpoints in a growing global movement for climate justice and Indigenous rights. Projects like the Kinder Morgan pipeline expansion (now owned by the Canadian government), Keystone XL, the Dakota Access Pipeline, Enbridge’s Line 3, and the Bayou Bridge pipeline have all faced intense resistance. Much of this resistance has been led by Indigenous communities defending their territories, rights, and ways of life.

These campaigns are grounded not only in concerns about climate change and Indigenous sovereignty, but also in the everyday reality of pipeline spills. Companies like Kinder Morgan, TransCanada, Enbridge, and Energy Transfer Partners (ETP) have all been involved in frequent spill incidents. Each spill, large or small, can contaminate rivers, wetlands, and farmland, leaving long-lasting damage and undermining trust in the companies and regulators who promised safety.

Rather than addressing these risks or respecting community opposition, parts of the oil industry have turned to aggressive tactics to silence critics. One stark example is the roughly $900 million SLAPP (Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation) lawsuit filed by ETP over opposition to the Dakota Access Pipeline. Such lawsuits are designed to intimidate and punish people and organisations who speak out, sending a chilling message to anyone considering resistance.

Despite this pressure, communities continue to stand up using powerful, nonviolent strategies. Along pipeline routes, people have built Watch Houses to monitor activity, bear witness, and create spaces for organizing and ceremony. Others have installed solar panels and other renewable energy systems as living examples of the clean alternatives to fossil fuels. Acts of civil disobedience—such as blockades, sit-ins, and peaceful occupation of construction sites—have drawn global attention to the stakes of these fights and the courage of those on the frontlines.

These struggles are about more than individual pipelines. They are part of a broader demand to move away from fossil fuels and toward renewable energy systems that protect water, respect Indigenous rights, and safeguard ecosystems and communities. Every nonviolent action, every Watch House, every solar installation sends the same message: it is time to leave oil pipelines behind and build a safer, renewable future.
