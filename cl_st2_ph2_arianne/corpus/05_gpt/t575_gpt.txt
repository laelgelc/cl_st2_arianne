Climate change is already eroding some of our most basic human rights: the rights to health, food, water, housing, work, and ultimately life itself. Its impacts are not shared equally. Those who have contributed least to the crisis—people living in poverty, Indigenous Peoples, workers on the frontlines, communities in vulnerable regions—are often those who suffer first and worst.

This is not only an environmental crisis; it is a profound justice and human rights crisis. Governments and corporations that continue to fuel climate disruption are failing in their duties and responsibilities. They are putting short-term profit and political convenience above the lives and dignity of people and communities around the world.

Yet the tools and solutions to change course already exist. Renewable energy technologies are available and increasingly affordable. Pathways that respect human rights and protect communities are known. What is missing is the political will to act at the scale and speed that science and justice demand.

Across the world, people are refusing to accept inaction. Students are walking out of classrooms to demand a livable future. Indigenous Peoples are defending their lands, territories, and ways of life. Workers are speaking out for a just transition that protects both jobs and the planet. Activists and communities are organizing, marching, and raising their voices to insist that those in power be held to account.

This growing movement is rooted in a simple truth: climate justice is inseparable from human rights. Protecting the climate means protecting people—especially those who are already marginalized and at risk. It means insisting that governments uphold their human rights obligations and that corporations respect human rights throughout their operations and supply chains.

To help bring these struggles and communities together, civil society organizations and the UN Human Rights Office are convening the People’s Summit on Climate, Rights and Human Survival on September 18–19 in New York. This summit will bring the human rights and environmental communities into closer alignment around a shared agenda for climate justice.

The summit is an invitation—to governments, to businesses, and above all to people everywhere—to recognize that the fight against climate change is a fight for human dignity, equality, and survival. It is a call for urgent action grounded in justice, accountability, and respect for the rights of all.
