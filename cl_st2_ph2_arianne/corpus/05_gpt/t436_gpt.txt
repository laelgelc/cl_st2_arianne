On Philippine Independence Day, people across the country marked freedom under the shadow of a prolonged crisis. Metro Manila had already endured 89 days of COVID-19 quarantine—the longest in the world—yet the curve had not been flattened and mass testing was still not in place. The quarantine was set to end on June 15, but instead of a clear path toward health, safety, and justice, another threat loomed: the Anti-Terrorism Bill.

This bill carries a sweeping and dangerously broad definition of terrorism. It opens the door for authorities to tag individuals and organizations as “terrorists” without a warrant, placing enormous power in the hands of the executive. Under its provisions, people can be detained for up to 24 days without charges, and subjected to surveillance for up to 90 days. These measures run counter to protections guaranteed by the Philippine Constitution and international human rights law.

The implications are particularly alarming for those who already face discrimination and violence. Vulnerable groups such as Muslims and Lumad communities—who have long experienced marginalization—are at heightened risk of being targeted. Instead of addressing the root causes of conflict and injustice, the bill further endangers those who most need protection.

At a time when people are grappling with overlapping crises—worsening poverty, a global pandemic, and the escalating impacts of the climate emergency—activism and public participation are more essential than ever. Yet the Anti-Terrorism Bill threatens to criminalize dissent and silence those who speak out for their rights, their lands, and their future. It prioritizes suppressing opposition over confronting the real threats to people’s lives and livelihoods.

While communities struggle to stay healthy, fed, and secure, the government continues to push a business-as-usual recovery agenda. This includes support for destructive activities such as mining and bailouts that favor powerful interests, instead of investing in people-centered solutions and resilient, sustainable livelihoods. Such a path deepens existing inequalities and leaves frontline communities even more exposed to crisis after crisis.

In this context, the call for a #BetterNormal is a call for genuine freedom and safety: a society where rights are upheld, where vulnerable groups are protected rather than persecuted, and where recovery plans put people and the planet first. Greenpeace stands with communities resisting repression and demanding a future that breaks from the old patterns of exploitation and neglect. The struggle for independence today means defending space for activism, protecting human rights, and building a better normal for all.
