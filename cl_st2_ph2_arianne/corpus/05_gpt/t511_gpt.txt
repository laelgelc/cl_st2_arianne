On World Fisheries Day, women fish processors from across West Africa came together in Dakar with a clear and urgent message: the expansion of fishmeal factories is putting their livelihoods, their communities’ food security, and the health of the ocean at risk.

These women work at the heart of artisanal fisheries, transforming fresh fish into food that feeds local families and markets. In Senegal alone, fisheries provide more than 600,000 jobs and supply 70% of the country’s animal protein needs. For many coastal communities, especially women, fish processing is not just a job – it is the backbone of household income and nutrition.

But the rapid growth of fishmeal factories is changing everything. These factories take fresh, edible fish and turn them into fishmeal and fish oil for animal feed in Europe and Asia. Instead of nourishing people locally, an increasing share of the catch is diverted into industrial processing, undermining local food supplies and pushing small-scale processors out of work.

The women gathered in Dakar denounced this shift as a direct threat to their survival and to the sustainability of marine ecosystems. They highlighted how using fish fit for human consumption to produce feed for animals elsewhere contradicts global commitments, including the UN’s sustainable development goals, which call for responsible consumption and production, the protection of life below water, and the eradication of poverty and hunger.

Their demands to the government are specific and practical. They are calling for a halt to the construction of new fishmeal factories and an end to the use of edible fish for fishmeal production. Instead of channelling public support and coastal resources into industrial plants that employ relatively few people, they are urging investment in their own sector.

One of their key proposals is support for refrigerating units and related infrastructure for artisanal processors. With cold storage, women fish processors can preserve fish longer, reduce waste, secure better prices, and strengthen local and regional food markets. Unlike fishmeal factories, artisanal processing generates far more employment, especially for women, while keeping fish on people’s plates.

By standing together in Dakar, these women made visible a struggle that is often ignored: the conflict between industrial export-oriented production and the right of coastal communities to sustain their livelihoods and feed themselves. Their call is simple but powerful – protect jobs, protect food security, and protect the ocean by prioritising people over profit in fisheries policy.
