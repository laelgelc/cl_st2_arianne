The climate crises of 2021 — from deadly heat waves to devastating floods — are a stark warning. They have been described as a “code red for humanity,” a phrase that captures both the urgency and the scale of the emergency. While climate impacts have long hit developing nations hardest, these disasters make it clear that no country is insulated from the consequences of a warming world.

At the heart of this crisis lies a deep structural problem: an economic system driven by corporate greed and the relentless pursuit of profit. The resources of the super-rich are still being poured into activities that destroy the planet, rather than into solutions that could help secure a livable future. Changing this trajectory requires confronting the concentration of wealth and power that allows a small elite to shape economies and politics in their own interests.

One key step is taxing excessive wealth. Today, 183,000 ultra-wealthy individuals hold outsized influence over global decisions and resource use. Redirecting even a portion of their wealth through fair taxation could help fund the systemic changes needed to tackle the climate crisis. This is not just about raising money; it is about shifting power away from those who profit from destruction and towards the public good.

Transforming our economies also means moving away from fossil fuels and the corporate narratives that protect them. Banning fossil fuel advertising would remove a major tool used by polluting industries to delay action and mislead the public. At the same time, accelerating the rollout of renewable energy can help phase out dirty energy sources and build more resilient, equitable societies.

Supporting Indigenous resistance is another essential pillar of climate action. Indigenous communities are often on the frontlines of environmental destruction and have long defended their lands and ecosystems from exploitation. Backing their struggles is both a matter of justice and a powerful way to protect forests, water, and biodiversity that are critical to stabilizing the climate.

The current moment also invites reflection on how we got here. Fifty years after the publication of “The Limits to Growth,” which warned that endless economic expansion on a finite planet is impossible, societies remain locked into unsustainable patterns. Inequality has risen sharply, and the benefits of growth have been captured by a small minority, while the costs — pollution, climate chaos, and social dislocation — are pushed onto the many.

The COVID-19 pandemic exposed and deepened these inequalities. The unequal access to healthcare, vaccines, and economic support during the pandemic offers a preview of how climate impacts are likely to be distributed if nothing changes: those with wealth and power shield themselves, while marginalized communities bear the brunt. This is a warning of what climate inequality looks like in practice.

In response, Greenpeace is working alongside allies such as the Fight Inequality Alliance to help shift priorities from private profit to planetary well-being. This collaboration is about reimagining what our economies are for, and who they serve. It means challenging the idea that the wealth of a few is more important than the health of people and the planet.

The climate emergencies of 2021 show that the status quo is untenable. Ending corporate greed, taxing excessive wealth, banning fossil fuel ads, supporting Indigenous resistance, and rapidly scaling up renewables are all part of a broader effort to build societies that are fair, sustainable, and capable of withstanding the crises ahead. The choice is between continuing on a path of inequality and destruction, or using the immense resources already in our hands to build a livable future for everyone.
