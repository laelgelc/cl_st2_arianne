Economist William Nordhaus has had enormous influence on how governments, businesses, and international institutions think about climate change. His work underpins many mainstream economic models that claim the world can afford to move slowly on climate action, because the damages from global heating will supposedly be modest. But this view rests on assumptions that have been heavily criticized as detached from physical reality and dangerously biased toward protecting economic growth over people and the planet.

One early warning Nordhaus dismissed was the Limits to Growth study, which used system dynamics to explore how exponential economic and population growth could collide with the finite resources and ecological boundaries of the Earth. Rather than seriously engaging with the study’s core message about ecological limits, Nordhaus rejected it, helping to entrench an economic worldview in which continuous growth is treated as both possible and desirable, regardless of environmental constraints.

At the heart of Nordhaus’s influence on climate policy is his so‑called Damage Function: a simple mathematical relationship that links rising temperatures to economic losses, typically expressed as a percentage of global GDP. In his models, even substantial levels of warming translate into surprisingly small losses. This leads to the conclusion that the “optimal” path is to allow significant climate change to occur, because aggressive mitigation is portrayed as more expensive than the damages themselves.

Critics argue that this is not just wrong, but absurd. Steve Keen has highlighted how Nordhaus’s Damage Function effectively assumes that large parts of the economy will remain untouched by climate change, as if only sectors that depend directly on outdoor weather would be affected. This ignores the way energy, ecosystems, and climate stability underpin every aspect of modern life and production. By treating climate as a marginal factor rather than a foundational condition, the models downplay the true scale of risk.

Nicholas Stern has similarly condemned these approaches as unscientific and deeply misleading. He argues that models like Nordhaus’s fail to account for tipping points in the Earth system—such as ice sheet collapse, rainforest dieback, or disruption of major ocean currents—that could trigger abrupt and irreversible changes. They also gloss over the complex interactions between ecological degradation, social stability, and economic functioning. When the climate system is pushed beyond safe limits, impacts cannot be neatly summarized as a small fraction of GDP.

Another core problem is the way these models treat time, people, and inequality. Nordhaus’s framework uses discounting that heavily devalues future harms compared to present-day costs. In practice, this means that the suffering of future generations counts for far less in policy decisions. It also means that the lives and livelihoods of the poor—who are most exposed to climate impacts and least able to adapt—are effectively treated as expendable in the pursuit of continued growth.

This bias is closely tied to the broader ideology of neoliberal economics, which has dominated global policymaking for decades. Under this worldview, market expansion and GDP growth are prioritized above all else, while environmental destruction is rationalized as a necessary or acceptable cost. As wealth inequality has soared, the benefits of this system have flowed overwhelmingly to the richest segments of society, who also wield the most influence over policy and investment decisions.

The result is a stark injustice: a small, wealthy minority continues to profit from fossil fuel extraction and resource exploitation, while the costs are pushed onto the majority of humanity and the natural world. Communities on the frontlines of climate impacts face floods, droughts, heatwaves, and ecosystem collapse, while economic models reassure decision‑makers that the overall “damage” will be limited.

By minimizing the dangers of climate breakdown and erasing ecological complexity, Nordhaus’s work has provided a convenient intellectual cover for inaction and delay. Critics like Keen and Stern argue that clinging to such models is not just a technical mistake but a profound ethical failure. It allows policymakers to pretend that incremental tweaks within a growth‑obsessed system are enough, even as the climate crisis accelerates and inequality deepens.

Confronting the reality of climate change means rejecting frameworks that treat the Earth as a set of numbers in a spreadsheet and future generations as discounted entries in a ledger. It requires acknowledging that the economy is a wholly owned subsidiary of the environment, not the other way around—and that any serious response to the crisis must put justice, ecological integrity, and the protection of vulnerable people at its core, rather than the preservation of an unequal and destructive status quo.
