Around the world, communities are already feeling the impacts of a rapidly changing climate. From more frequent and intense storms to heatwaves and other extreme weather events, the signs are clear: the climate crisis is here, and the cost of inaction grows every day. In this moment, choosing to delay is the same as choosing to make the problem worse.

That’s why it matters so much what the world’s largest companies do. Their decisions about how they power their factories and supply chains directly affect how fast we can move away from fossil fuels and toward a safer, renewable future.

Samsung Electronics is one of those companies with enormous influence. In 2016 alone, it produced 400 million smartphones and supplied components to some of the biggest names in tech and clean transport, including Apple and Tesla. That same year, Samsung earned $10 billion in profit. With that scale and wealth comes a responsibility to lead on climate, not lag behind.

Yet Samsung still relies heavily on dirty energy like coal to power its production, using only 1% renewable energy in its manufacturing. This is a stark contrast to some of its rivals. Companies like Apple have already switched to 100% renewable energy for their own operations, showing that a different path is not only possible, but already underway in the industry.

Samsung promotes itself with bold slogans and a forward-looking image, but those words ring hollow as long as its factories keep running on fossil fuels. A company that shapes the future of technology should not be clinging to the energy sources of the past. It’s time for Samsung to match its marketing with meaningful action by committing to renewable energy across its operations.

This is not just about one company’s brand; it’s about whether major corporations will help tackle the climate crisis or keep fueling it. Samsung has the resources, the technical expertise, and the global reach to make a real difference—if it chooses to.

People everywhere can help push Samsung to make that choice. By speaking out, raising this issue publicly, and demanding better from such a powerful company, we can increase the pressure for change. Samsung must stop relying on coal and other dirty energy and commit to renewable power. The climate can’t wait, and neither can we.
