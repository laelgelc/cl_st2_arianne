A new joint study by Greenpeace Russia and the University of Maryland delivers an alarming message: unless urgent action is taken, most of the planet’s remaining wild forests could disappear within just two decades.

These wild forests—known as Intact Forest Landscapes (IFLs)—are areas of at least 50,000 hectares with no settlements or roads, where nature still functions largely undisturbed. Between 2000 and 2020, the world lost 12% of these irreplaceable ecosystems, an area equivalent to three times the size of Spain. If current trends continue, a third of all IFLs are projected to be gone by 2050.

The climate crisis is intensifying the destruction, especially in northern regions such as Russia, Canada, and Alaska. Longer fire seasons and more frequent droughts are driving larger and more severe forest fires, pushing these ecosystems beyond their ability to recover.

In Brazil’s Amazon, industrial animal farming and land-grabbing are rapidly degrading once-intact forests. These activities not only destroy biodiversity and carbon-rich ecosystems, they also displace Indigenous communities who have lived in and protected these forests for generations.

The pattern of loss is spreading. The Democratic Republic of Congo, Indonesia, and countries across tropical South America are experiencing increasing rates of IFL destruction. While Canada and the United States have seen reduced rates of loss, the overall global trend remains deeply troubling.

The consequences of losing wild forests are profound. IFLs store vast amounts of carbon, helping to stabilise the climate. They are home to Indigenous cultures and communities, provide habitat for countless species, and help prevent soil erosion and flooding. Once fragmented or degraded, these forests lose many of these critical functions and become far more vulnerable to further damage.

The study points to clear solutions. To protect what remains of the world’s wild forests, governments and companies must:

- Halt wood harvesting projects in IFLs.
- End industrial production of meat, dairy, soy, and palm oil that drives deforestation and forest degradation.
- Avoid any further fragmentation of intact forest areas, including through new roads and infrastructure.
- Recognise and uphold the rights of Indigenous peoples, whose stewardship is essential to forest protection.
- Put people and the planet before corporate profits in all decisions that affect forests.

The choice is stark and urgent: continue on the current path and watch most of Earth’s last wild forests vanish within a generation, or act now to protect these vital ecosystems and the communities that depend on them.
