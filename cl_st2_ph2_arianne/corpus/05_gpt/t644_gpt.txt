At COP24, the dysfunction of global politics was laid bare, not by a seasoned diplomat, but by a 15-year-old. Greta Thunberg stepped into a space dominated by decades of polished speeches and hollow promises and said what negotiators would not: the world has been warned for generations, and yet emissions keep rising.

Scientists have been sounding the alarm since at least 1979. In the years since, governments have cycled through pep-talks, pledges, and photo opportunities, but the basic trajectory has not changed. Greenhouse gas emissions have continued to climb, and the gap between what is promised and what is actually done has only grown wider. COP24 was supposed to be the moment when the Paris Agreement’s lofty words were turned into concrete action. Instead, it exposed how unwilling global leaders remain to confront the root causes of the crisis.

Against this backdrop, a powerful youth coalition and allied movements put forward the “People’s Demands for Climate Justice.” Their message cuts through the diplomatic fog with a clarity that official texts still lack.

First, they insist that fossil fuels must be kept in the ground. This is not a rhetorical flourish; it is a direct challenge to the ongoing expansion of coal, oil, and gas extraction that continues even as governments claim to be committed to climate action. Calling for an end to fossil fuel subsidies is a logical extension of this demand. Public money is still being used to prop up an industry that is driving the crisis, while communities on the frontlines bear the brunt of its impacts.

Second, the People’s Demands reject “false solutions” and techno-fixes that promise to solve the crisis without changing the underlying system. These include schemes that rely on unproven future technologies or market tweaks while allowing business as usual to continue. Such approaches offer political cover for delay rather than real pathways to rapid emission cuts and justice for affected communities.

Third, the demands call for climate reparations from rich nations. This is a direct acknowledgment of historical responsibility: industrialised countries have benefited most from a fossil-fuelled economic model and contributed the most to the problem, while many of the poorest communities face the harshest consequences. Reparations mean more than aid; they imply a duty to repair, redistribute resources, and support a just transition shaped by those most affected.

Fourth, they insist on halting corporate interference in climate policymaking. Fossil fuel interests and their allies have had a seat at the table for far too long, shaping rules and narratives to protect their profits. As long as those driving the crisis are allowed to masquerade as partners in solving it, climate policy will remain compromised.

Underlying all of this is a deeper challenge to one of the central dogmas of contemporary politics: the belief in “green growth.” The idea that economies can keep growing indefinitely while overall resource use and emissions fall is presented as common sense in many official forums. But the blog post points to studies that show a persistent link between economic growth, increased resource extraction, and rising emissions. Despite efficiency gains and renewable energy deployment, the overall scale of economic activity continues to push us further into ecological overshoot.

By highlighting this evidence, the post exposes “green growth” as a dangerous delusion. It reassures politicians and corporations that they can maintain current patterns of production and consumption with only minor adjustments, while the biophysical limits of the planet are being breached. Efficiency improvements and cleaner technologies are necessary, but they are not sufficient if total throughput of energy and materials keeps expanding.

The conclusion is stark but necessary: addressing ecological overshoot requires systemic change, not cosmetic reform. That means deliberately contracting growth in the sectors and regions that are overshooting planetary boundaries, rather than chasing endless expansion. It means reorganising economies around sufficiency, care, and redistribution instead of extraction, accumulation, and waste.

At COP24, the contrast could not have been clearer. On one side, negotiators clung to incrementalism, market mechanisms, and the myth that we can grow our way out of a crisis caused by growth itself. On the other, young people and frontline communities demanded that we face reality: decades of pep-talks have failed, emissions are still rising, and time is running out.

The People’s Demands for Climate Justice are not a side note to the official process; they are a direct response to its failures. Keeping fossil fuels underground, ending subsidies, rejecting false solutions, securing climate reparations, and kicking corporate polluters out of climate policymaking are not radical extras. They are the minimum steps required if we are serious about stabilising the climate and living within the limits of the Earth.

The dysfunction of global politics at COP24 was not an accident; it is the predictable outcome of a system built on endless growth and corporate power. Breaking that pattern will not come from another round of empty speeches. It will come from the kind of clear-eyed honesty Greta Thunberg voiced, and from the organised power of movements insisting that climate justice, not green growth, must define our future.
