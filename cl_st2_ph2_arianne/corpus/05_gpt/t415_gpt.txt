Disposable face masks have become an unexpected symbol of the COVID-19 era, not only in hospitals and clinics but also scattered across coasts and beaches around the world. Taiwan is no exception. As the pandemic unfolded, masks became essential for public health, yet the environmental cost of this surge in single-use protective equipment is now coming into focus.

From February to May alone, Taiwan is estimated to have used 1.3 billion face masks, generating around 5,500 tonnes of waste. Medical masks used in healthcare settings are generally handled through established waste management systems, but the masks used by the public fall into a grey area. These everyday masks are typically not recyclable, largely because of contamination risks, and they often end up in regular waste streams—or worse, in the natural environment.

When masks are discarded inappropriately, they can be carried by wind and water into rivers, oceans, and coastal areas. There, the polypropylene used in many disposable masks can gradually break down, contributing to plastic pollution that threatens ecosystems and marine life. This degradation does not make the material harmless; instead, it can fragment into smaller pieces that persist in the environment and pose ongoing risks to wildlife.

In response, the government has taken steps focused on public education and the use of fines to discourage littering and improper disposal. These efforts are part of a broader attempt to address the visible and growing problem of mask waste. However, the situation also exposes a gap in how societies manage single-use personal protective equipment more generally.

There is a clear need for comprehensive guidelines that address the full life cycle of single-use PPE, from production and distribution to use and disposal. Such guidelines must find a way to balance urgent public health needs with long-term environmental sustainability. This includes clarifying responsibilities, setting standards for proper handling and disposal, and ensuring that people have the information they need to protect both their health and the planet.

At the same time, the challenge of mask waste connects directly to ongoing advocacy to reduce plastic use overall. The pandemic has highlighted how quickly single-use items can multiply when convenience and safety are prioritized without adequate planning for their environmental impact. Continuing to push for plastic reduction, even in the context of a global health crisis, remains essential to protecting oceans, coasts, and communities from the growing burden of plastic pollution.
