In the winter streets of Berlin, 18,000 people came together to send a clear message: industrial agriculture is failing people, animals, and the planet—and it’s time for a fundamental change.

This seventh annual demonstration, highlighted by Dirk Zimmermann, senior food campaigner at Greenpeace Germany, has become one of Europe’s largest protests against an agricultural model built on pesticides, pollution, genetic engineering, land grabbing, animal mistreatment, and concentrated control over our food systems. The scale of the march reflects something bigger than one city or one country: a growing global demand for a just, sustainable way of producing food.

Behind the banners and chants lies a concrete vision of how that change could look. A recent Greenpeace study shows that Germany can fully ecologize its agriculture by 2050 and still feed 76 million people with high-quality food produced mostly within its own borders. This isn’t a call for scarcity or sacrifice for its own sake—it’s a pathway to a food system that respects ecosystems, treats animals better, and supports farmers fairly.

But getting there won’t happen by accident. It requires political courage and clear decisions. Public money must stop propping up destructive industrial practices and instead support ecological farming. Subsidies need to be redirected so that they reward environmental protection, animal welfare, and climate-friendly production rather than sheer volume and intensification. Livestock systems must be improved to reduce suffering and lower the massive environmental footprint of animal agriculture.

At the same time, this transformation depends on choices made far beyond parliaments and ministries. What we put on our plates, how much we throw away, and what kind of farming we choose to support with our purchases all matter.

The study underlines three key shifts that people and policymakers can drive together:

- Halving meat consumption and production. This is essential to reducing environmental damage from industrial livestock farming, from pollution to the overuse of land and resources.
- Cutting food waste by 50%. Perfectly good food is routinely discarded along the supply chain and in households. Halving this waste would ease pressure on land, water, and climate.
- Ensuring fair prices for farmers. A sustainable food system cannot be built on the backs of farmers forced to sell at prices that don’t cover the true costs of ecological production and good animal welfare.

The Berlin protest shows that more and more people understand these connections and are ready to stand up for a different future. A fully ecological agriculture in Germany by 2050 is not just a technical scenario—it is a political and social choice. With determined action from governments and a shift in everyday habits, it is within reach.
