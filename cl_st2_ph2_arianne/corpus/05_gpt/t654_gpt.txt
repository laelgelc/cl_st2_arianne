Gender Day at the global climate talks is a reminder that the fight for climate justice and the fight for gender equality are deeply connected. It highlights how feminism and environmentalism together can open a path out of the climate crisis, especially when women’s rights and leadership are placed at the centre of climate action.

Climate change does not impact everyone equally. Women, particularly those living in poverty, are often hit hardest. Many women’s livelihoods depend directly on natural resources that are becoming more scarce or unpredictable due to climate change. At the same time, women frequently have less access to decision-making spaces where climate and energy policies are shaped, which means their specific needs and knowledge are too often ignored.

A fair and effective energy transition must take these inequalities into account. Integrating gender perspectives into climate policy is not an optional add-on; it is essential. Inclusive policies that recognise different social roles, responsibilities, and vulnerabilities are necessary to ensure that climate action does not deepen existing inequalities. Women’s active involvement in designing, implementing, and monitoring climate and energy strategies is crucial to making them just and sustainable.

The Gender Action Plan adopted last year is an important step in this direction. It aims to strengthen gender-responsive climate policy and ensure that women’s rights and participation are embedded in climate decision-making. Events at COP24 have been organised to support and advance this plan, reinforcing the message that climate solutions must be grounded in equality and inclusion.

Across communities, women are already leading the way. They are at the forefront of sustainable practices and local resource management, from farming and water use to community-based conservation and energy initiatives. In politics and public life, women are pushing for climate policies that prioritise social justice, human rights, and long-term community well-being.

Their leadership helps shape a renewable energy system that is not only low-carbon, but also more democratic and fair. When women participate equally in decisions about land, water, energy, and finance, the result is a more resilient society—one that values care, cooperation, and shared responsibility.

Gender Day underscores that climate justice and gender justice must advance together. By recognising women’s disproportionate vulnerability to climate impacts, supporting their rights, and amplifying their leadership, the world can move towards a renewable energy future rooted in equality, democracy, and thriving communities.
