The climate and plastic pollution crises are deeply connected, driven by the same forces: fossil fuels and corporate practices that prioritize profit over people and the planet. As the world struggles to keep global heating in check, oil and gas giants are increasingly betting on plastics as a lifeline, locking us into more production, more waste, and more harm for communities on the frontlines.

Exxon is a stark example. Even as the climate emergency worsens, the company is expanding plastic production instead of winding down fossil fuels. This expansion fuels a surge of single-use packaging and products that are designed to be thrown away, not reused. At the same time, consumer brands like Coca-Cola continue to flood the world with single-use plastic bottles, despite knowing that recycling has failed to deal with the problem at scale. Only 9% of all plastic ever produced has been recycled, yet companies keep pushing the myth that recycling alone can fix a crisis they helped create.

Contributors Marian Ledesma and Graham Forbes highlight how these decisions play out in real lives and real places. In the Philippines, plastic pollution chokes waterways, clogs drainage systems, and burdens communities that are already vulnerable to climate impacts like typhoons and flooding. Waste is often burned or dumped, creating toxic smoke and contaminated environments that threaten people’s health. In the United States, communities living near petrochemical and plastic production facilities face air and water pollution, health risks, and economic systems that depend on dirty industries instead of sustainable, community-centered alternatives.

These are not isolated problems. The health and economic impacts of plastic and fossil fuels are intertwined across borders. From the extraction of oil and gas, to refining and plastic production, to the waste that ends up in landfills, incinerators, and the environment, the entire plastic lifecycle is harming people and the climate. The costs are pushed onto communities and public systems, while corporations profit.

Ledesma and Forbes argue that the world must move beyond a narrow focus on recycling and embrace systemic shifts toward reuse. Recycling has been used as a convenient excuse to maintain business as usual, even as evidence shows it cannot keep up with the sheer volume of plastic being produced. A real solution means dramatically reducing plastic production in the first place and scaling up reusable systems that cut waste at the source.

That requires strong policies and clear accountability. Governments need to ban unnecessary single-use plastics and support reuse models that work for people and the environment. Corporations must be held responsible for the full impacts of the products and packaging they put into the world. A global plastics treaty is a critical opportunity to set binding rules that reduce plastic production, protect communities, and end the era of disposable packaging.

The responsibility falls especially on the world’s biggest plastic polluters. Companies like Coca-Cola, Pepsi, and Nestlé must urgently transition away from single-use plastics and invest in reusable systems at scale. Instead of clinging to outdated, throwaway models, they need to redesign how products are delivered, prioritizing refill, reuse, and systems that do not rely on endless fossil-fuel-based plastic.

The intertwined crises of climate change and plastic pollution demand bold, systemic change. Communities in the Philippines, the US, and around the world are already paying the price for corporate inaction and fossil fuel dependency. Shifting from recycling myths to real reuse solutions, backed by strong policies and a global plastics treaty, is essential to protect people, the climate, and our shared future.
