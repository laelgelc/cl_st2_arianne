They may look like something out of a myth – part whale, part shark – but whale sharks are among the gentlest beings in the sea. As the world marks International Whale Shark Day, it’s a moment to celebrate these extraordinary animals and reflect on how urgently they need our protection.

Whale sharks glide through warm tropical oceans, from the turquoise waters of the Maldives to coastal hotspots in the Philippines and Mexico. They’re the largest non-mammalian vertebrates on Earth, yet they feed mainly on some of the tiniest life in the ocean: plankton. Despite their massive size, they pose no threat to humans.

Each whale shark carries a unique pattern of spots and stripes, as individual as a human fingerprint. These natural “ID cards” allow scientists and conservationists to track and study them over time, deepening our understanding of their lives and migrations.

But while they are peaceful, humans have not been so kind in return. Whale sharks are hunted for their fins and meat, and their slow breeding makes them especially vulnerable to overfishing. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lists them as highly vulnerable, a stark warning that their future is far from secure.

Some countries, like Indonesia, have put conservation laws in place to protect whale sharks. Yet on the water, enforcement remains weak, leaving these gentle giants exposed to ongoing threats.

On International Whale Shark Day, raising a glass to these magnificent animals is more than a symbolic gesture. It’s a reminder that they need strong protection and healthy oceans to survive – and that our actions can help safeguard both their future and the blue planet they call home.
