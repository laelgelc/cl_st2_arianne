Around the world, a powerful group of women photographers is using the camera as a tool for resistance, testimony, and care—turning environmental and humanitarian crises into stories that cannot be ignored.

Suzanne Lee documents the hidden realities of child labor in Indian coal mines, revealing how environmental exploitation and human exploitation often go hand in hand. Her images make visible the children whose lives and futures are being consumed by an industry that treats both people and land as expendable.

In Ethiopia, Hilina Abebe focuses her lens on the human face of climate change. Through her work, the abstract idea of a warming planet becomes grounded in everyday life: families, landscapes, and communities navigating shifting seasons, water scarcity, and the cascading impacts on livelihoods and culture.

Far to the north and south, Acacia Johnson turns her attention to the polar regions. Her photographs explore these fragile, icy environments at the frontlines of climate disruption, capturing both their stark beauty and their vulnerability in a rapidly changing world.

In Chile, Tamara Merino works in the Atacama Desert, one of the driest places on Earth. She documents the rare desert blooms that transform the landscape, as well as the isolation experienced by people who live in such an extreme environment. Her images link the resilience of life in the desert with the emotional realities of human solitude and endurance.

Gayatri Ganju creates visual narratives that weave together humans and nature, blurring the lines between the two. Her work emphasizes how deeply intertwined our lives are with the ecosystems around us, challenging any notion that people and the natural world exist in separate spheres.

Ann Wang’s photography takes us into the Peruvian Amazon, where she documents oil spills that contaminate rivers and forests. Her images expose the environmental damage and the threat it poses to the communities and biodiversity that depend on these waters and lands.

Diana Zeyneb Alhindawi focuses on the intersections of conservation and poverty. Her work highlights how efforts to protect nature often collide with the daily struggles of people living in or near protected areas, raising urgent questions about justice, access, and whose needs are prioritized.

Underwater, Ellen Cuylaerts turns her eye to marine life. Her photographs reveal the richness and vulnerability of ocean ecosystems, inviting viewers to consider what is at stake as seas warm, acidify, and fill with pollution.

Back in the Amazon, Jessica Suarez uses her photography to advocate for the preservation of this critical rainforest. Her work underscores the importance of protecting one of the planet’s most vital ecosystems, both for the people who live there and for the global climate.

In Ecuador’s Yasuni National Park, Karla Gachet portrays the lives of Indigenous communities whose cultures and territories are inseparable from the forest. Her images show how Indigenous peoples are central to the story of conservation, guardians of a place where biodiversity and traditional knowledge are deeply intertwined.

These photographers work across continents and ecosystems, but they are united by a shared commitment: to use imagery as a catalyst for action. Their photographs, featured in major outlets, confront audiences with the realities of environmental destruction and human suffering, while also revealing resilience, connection, and care. In doing so, they challenge inaction and invite us to see the climate and ecological crises not as distant issues, but as urgent, human stories unfolding right now.
