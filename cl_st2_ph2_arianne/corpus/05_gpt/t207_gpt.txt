Education is one of the most powerful tools African women and girls have to confront the climate crisis. In Vanessa Nakate’s reflection, this truth is grounded in everyday realities: for many girls without access to schooling, life options narrow to early marriage, small-scale farming, or domestic work. These paths are not chosen freely, but shaped by poverty, social expectations, and the absence of alternatives.

Without education, there is little room for activism or civic engagement. Barriers such as lack of internet access and unstable work make it extremely difficult for girls and young women to learn about the climate crisis, connect with others, or participate in public debates. Time is consumed by survival and unpaid care work, not by organizing, campaigning, or influencing decisions that will shape their futures.

Nakate describes how her own family’s commitment to education opened doors that remain closed to many others. In Uganda, there has been progress: primary school enrolment for girls has reached near parity with boys. But this progress thins out at higher levels of education. As girls grow older, the obstacles multiply, and many drop out before they can access the knowledge, skills, and networks that would allow them to take part in climate decision-making.

The COVID-19 pandemic has deepened these inequalities. With economic strain pushing families to cut costs, school fees are often the first expense to go. This puts years of hard-won gains for girls’ education at risk. When girls leave school, they are less likely to return, and the cycle of limited options continues. The loss is not only personal; it also weakens communities’ capacity to respond to climate impacts, as fewer educated girls become the women who could lead, innovate, and advocate for change.

Globally, millions of girls are missing out on education altogether. This absence has direct consequences for climate justice. When girls are excluded from classrooms, they are also excluded from the spaces where climate policies are debated and decided. Their experiences of drought, floods, and shifting seasons—often felt first and hardest by women and girls—go unheard in the rooms where solutions are shaped.

Nakate’s message is clear: ensuring that girls can go to school and stay in school is not only about fairness or individual opportunity. It is also about who gets to imagine, design, and drive climate solutions. When girls are educated, they gain the tools to speak, to organize, and to lead. When they are not, the world loses vital voices in the struggle against the climate crisis.
