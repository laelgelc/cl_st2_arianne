The streets of Amsterdam were packed, loud, and defiantly colorful as we joined the city’s largest Pride Walk, marching side by side with Queers4Climate NL, Extinction Rebellion, and fellow Greenpeace activists. Surrounded by banners, drums, and chants, it was impossible to forget why we were there: Pride is not just a party. Pride is, and has always been, a protest.

We marched to defend LGBTQIA+ rights in a world already being reshaped by the climate crisis. Pride began as resistance against oppression, and that spirit is urgently needed today as climate disasters intensify existing inequalities and create new forms of vulnerability.

For many LGBTQIA+ people, climate breakdown is not an abstract future threat. When floods, storms, fires, or cyclones hit, those already pushed to the margins are often the first to lose their homes, their safety, and their support systems. Homelessness risks rise when families or communities reject LGBTQIA+ people, and climate chaos piles on top of that, destroying housing, livelihoods, and access to care.

In some places, extreme weather is even weaponised as a tool of hate. In Fiji, for example, devastating cyclones have been blamed on “sodomy,” turning climate disasters into excuses to attack and scapegoat LGBTQIA+ communities. This is what happens when climate injustice and queerphobia collide: the people least responsible for the crisis are blamed and punished for it.

That is why we marched: to make visible the connections between climate justice and queer liberation, and to insist that neither can be achieved without the other.

At Greenpeace, we fight for a world that is not only fossil-free, but also just, safe, and diverse. A world where no one is left behind in the transition away from coal, oil, and gas. That means standing up to the corporations and governments that fuel the climate crisis, and calling out the greenwashing that tries to paint them as part of the solution while they continue to pollute and profit.

Polluters want us to believe they can sponsor Pride floats, paint their logos rainbow, and call it progress, all while driving climate breakdown that harms the very communities they claim to support. We know better. Real solidarity means cutting emissions, ending fossil fuel expansion, and centering those most affected by the crisis — including LGBTQIA+ people on the frontlines of climate impacts.

The climate movement is strongest when it is inclusive. Our power lies in the diversity of people who show up: queer, trans, intersex, Black, Indigenous, people of colour, disabled people, workers, migrants, youth, elders. Every identity, every story, every struggle for dignity and safety makes the movement richer and more resilient.

That’s why we are calling on LGBTQIA+ climate activists — and those who want to be — to join us. Whether you are marching in Pride, organising in your community, or speaking up in your workplace or school, your voice matters in the fight for climate justice.

Pride began as a protest and remains a protest: against hatred, against exploitation, against systems that decide whose lives are worth protecting. In the face of the climate crisis, that protest must grow louder, prouder, and more united.

On the streets of Amsterdam, surrounded by Queers4Climate NL, Extinction Rebellion, and Greenpeace flags, it was clear: this is what that future looks like. A movement that refuses to choose between the planet and people. A movement that knows there can be no climate justice without queer liberation — and no queer liberation on a burning planet.
