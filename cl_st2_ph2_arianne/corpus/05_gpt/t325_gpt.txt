As the world stepped into 2021, many of us hoped it would finally bring a sense of normalcy after the upheaval and loss of the pandemic. There was a shared desire to return to familiar routines, reconnect with loved ones, and rebuild what had been shaken. Yet even as vaccines rolled out and restrictions began to ease in some places, it became clear that the “new normal” would still be shaped by profound and ongoing challenges—especially those driven and intensified by the climate crisis.

Across the globe, the year opened with a stark reminder that our relationship with nature is dangerously out of balance. In Kenya, massive desert locust invasions threatened food security for communities already under strain. These swarms, linked to changing climate conditions, devoured crops and pasture, jeopardizing livelihoods and nutrition. At the same time, the response raised its own risks: concerns grew over the use of harmful pesticides that could damage ecosystems, contaminate water, and endanger human health. The choice between immediate pest control and long-term environmental harm underscored how deeply interconnected our crises have become.

Extreme weather events piled up in rapid succession, each one a signal that the climate emergency is not a distant prospect but a present reality. In Beijing, powerful sandstorms turned the sky an eerie yellow, disrupting daily life and forcing residents to confront the growing pressures on already fragile landscapes. In Australia, communities that had just endured devastating bushfires were hit by severe floods, a cruel whiplash from one disaster to another.

In Nepal, forest fires raged, threatening biodiversity, homes, and the air people breathe. Angola suffered deadly flash floods, sweeping away lives and livelihoods with terrifying speed. Spain was hit by a record snowstorm that paralysed transport and infrastructure. In Indonesia, floods linked to land clearing and environmental degradation inundated homes and displaced families. South Korea experienced its coldest day in decades, demonstrating how climate disruption can bring both intense heat and extreme cold.

Cyclone Eloise tore through Mozambique and neighbouring countries, leaving destruction in its wake and compounding existing vulnerabilities. In Texas, a polar vortex triggered widespread blackouts, exposing how unprepared infrastructure can be when pushed beyond its limits. And in the Amazon, severe floods hit Indigenous communities hard, threatening their homes, food sources, and cultural survival.

Taken together, these events are not isolated anomalies; they are part of a pattern that is rapidly becoming the defining feature of our age. They illustrate how the climate crisis amplifies existing inequalities, hitting those who have contributed the least to the problem the hardest, and stretching already fragile systems to breaking point.

Yet amid this sobering reality, there is still room for hope—if that hope is translated into action. The same global interconnectedness that allowed a virus to spread so quickly also enables rapid collaboration, shared knowledge, and collective problem-solving. The same ingenuity that delivered new vaccines in record time can be harnessed to transform our energy, food, and transport systems.

What 2021 has underscored is that safety and fairness in a warming world cannot be left to chance or to individual effort alone. They depend on deliberate, coordinated action from governments at every level. Policies that phase out fossil fuels, protect forests, support sustainable farming, and strengthen social protections are not optional extras; they are essential to safeguarding lives and livelihoods.

A just and livable future will only be possible if governments act together, guided by science and grounded in equity. The “new normal” does not have to be one of escalating disaster. It can be a world where communities are protected, ecosystems are restored, and the most vulnerable are placed at the centre of decision-making.

The crises of 2021 are a warning, but they are also a call: to recognise our shared vulnerability, to demand bold climate action, and to insist that recovery from the pandemic goes hand in hand with building a safer, fairer world for everyone.
