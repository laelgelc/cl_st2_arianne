For years, fossil fuel companies have treated oceans, coastlines, and Indigenous lands as sacrifice zones. But around the world, communities are proving that determined, organised resistance can stop even the biggest polluters in their tracks.

In Australia, Equinor’s plans to drill for oil in the Great Australian Bight triggered a wave of opposition. Coastal communities, Traditional Owners, and environmental organisations, including Greenpeace, campaigned relentlessly to protect one of the planet’s most unique and biodiverse marine environments. The Bight is home to whales, sea lions, and countless other species that would be devastated by a major oil spill.

Under growing public pressure and facing mounting scrutiny, Equinor walked away from its plans, citing a lack of commercial viability. The decision not only protects precious marine life, it also keeps over 800 million tonnes of carbon locked safely underground instead of being released into the atmosphere. This is a powerful example of how grassroots organising and sustained public pressure can reshape the decisions of multibillion-dollar corporations.

Across the Tasman Sea in Aotearoa New Zealand, the fossil fuel industry has also hit a wall. OMV’s much-hyped offshore exploration well failed to find commercially viable oil. This dry well didn’t just disappoint investors; it struck a blow to the narrative that offshore oil and gas have a long-term future in the country.

The result came amid a strong public backlash against new fossil fuel projects. Protests and community-led campaigning have helped drive a political shift, including a ban on new offshore oil and gas exploration permits. OMV’s failure underscores how out of step the industry has become with both public sentiment and a changing policy landscape.

In Canada, one of the most controversial fossil fuel projects in recent memory has also been shelved. Teck Resources withdrew its application for what would have been the country’s largest tar sands mine. The decision came in the context of intensifying economic uncertainty and growing recognition of the climate crisis.

Teck’s move acknowledged the combined weight of economic and climate pressures bearing down on high-carbon projects like the tar sands. For Indigenous communities who have long opposed the expansion of tar sands extraction, and for the ecosystems already under stress from existing operations, the withdrawal represents a significant reprieve. It is a rare instance of a major fossil fuel proposal being abandoned before construction, rather than resisted after the damage has begun.

Taken together, these three setbacks for Equinor, OMV, and Teck Resources show a fossil fuel industry in decline and on the defensive. They also show something else: when communities, Indigenous leaders, and climate advocates organise, speak out, and refuse to give up, they can change the course of history.

People power kept oil drills out of the Great Australian Bight. People power helped turn the tide against offshore exploration in New Zealand. People power contributed to making a massive tar sands mine too risky to pursue.

Each of these victories protects land, water, wildlife, and the climate. Each one chips away at the social licence of an industry driving the climate crisis. And each one reminds us that the transition away from fossil fuels is not only necessary—it is already underway, pushed forward by those who refuse to accept a future defined by oil, gas, and coal.

The story is far from over, but these moments of resistance and triumph show what is possible when communities stand together against the fossil fuel industry’s plans.
