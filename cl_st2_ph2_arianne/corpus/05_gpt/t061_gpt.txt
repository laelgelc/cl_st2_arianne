Last weekend, 35,000 people came together in Lützerath, Germany, to defend a village standing on the frontline of the climate crisis. The village is slated for demolition to make way for the expansion of RWE’s Garzweiler coal mine, which sits atop 280 million tons of lignite. Burning this coal would severely threaten Germany’s remaining carbon budget under the Paris Agreement, despite there being no energy need for it.

For more than two years, activists have occupied Lützerath, turning it into a powerful symbol of resistance against fossil fuel expansion. Their aim has been clear: stop the destruction of the village and prevent yet another massive fossil fuel project from locking in emissions that the climate cannot afford. In recent days, these activists have faced violent eviction by police, as authorities move to clear the way for the mine’s expansion.

The struggle in Lützerath is not an isolated case. It reflects a global pattern of communities standing up to fossil fuel projects that threaten their homes, livelihoods, and the climate. Similar fights are unfolding in East Africa, Argentina, India, and North America, where people are resisting oil, gas, and coal developments that put corporate profit over people and the planet.

Greenpeace stands alongside these communities, supporting their efforts to protect land, water, and climate. The situation in Lützerath and beyond underscores a broader injustice: just 100 companies are responsible for 70% of global emissions, while continuing to prioritise profits. Governments, instead of holding these polluters to account, are too often complicit in enabling further fossil fuel expansion.

The call from Lützerath echoes around the world: fossil fuel companies must be held accountable, and governments must stop siding with polluters. The courage of the 35,000 people who gathered in Lützerath, and of communities resisting destructive projects from East Africa to North America, is a reminder that the fight for climate justice is global, connected, and far from over.
