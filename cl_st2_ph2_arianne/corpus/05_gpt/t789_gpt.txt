Penguins have been popping up in some surprising places lately. Commuters have spotted them on trains, travelers have seen them in airports, and passersby have noticed them near famous landmarks in cities like Sydney, Buenos Aires, London, and Johannesburg. These unexpected sightings are part of a new Greenpeace campaign with a serious message: Antarctica’s wildlife needs urgent protection.

The campaign is shining a spotlight on the Antarctic Ocean, home to penguins, whales, seals, and a rich web of marine life. This fragile ecosystem is under pressure from industrial krill fishing and the growing impacts of climate change. Krill — tiny shrimp-like creatures — are a crucial food source for many Antarctic species. When industrial fleets target krill in large quantities, it threatens the entire food chain and the health of the ocean.

To help safeguard this unique region, Greenpeace is calling for the creation of a 1.8 million square kilometer Antarctic Ocean Sanctuary. This sanctuary would exclude industrial krill fishing from key areas, help limit the effects of climate change on vulnerable wildlife, and support the long-term health of the ocean.

A major decision point is approaching. In October, the Antarctic Ocean Commission will discuss the proposal for this sanctuary. That meeting represents a vital opportunity to secure meaningful protection for penguins, whales, seals, and the wider Antarctic ecosystem.

People everywhere are being urged to use their voices and demand that leaders act. By joining the call for an Antarctic Ocean Sanctuary, the public can help show that there is global support for stronger protection of this critical region.
