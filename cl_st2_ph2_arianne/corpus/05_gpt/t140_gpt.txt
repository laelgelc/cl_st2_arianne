When Gustav Martner walked onto the Cannes Lions stage this year, it wasn’t to collect another trophy. It was to give them back.

Once a celebrated ad man, Gustav built a career helping big brands win prestige at the world’s most famous advertising festival. Some of those awards were for airlines and car companies – industries whose business models are deeply tied to fossil fuels. This year, as Greenpeace Nordic’s Head of Creative, he returned those trophies in front of the industry that had once applauded his work.

His message was simple and direct: it’s time to stop selling fossil fuels.

Gustav’s action at Cannes was a protest against an industry that continues to reward campaigns for polluters and greenwashers, even as the world faces intensifying climate crises. While wars, droughts, and record-breaking heat unfold across the globe, the advertising world still rolls out the red carpet for brands whose products drive those very crises – and for the spin that helps them look responsible while they delay real change.

For Gustav, this is not the position he started from. His turning point came after watching films like “An Inconvenient Truth,” which forced him to confront the contradiction between his professional success and the climate reality. The dissonance only grew after the Paris Agreement, when the world formally committed to limiting global heating – yet fossil fuel campaigns continued not only to run, but to win awards.

In recent years, the IPCC has made clear how fossil fuel companies have used sophisticated delay tactics to protect their business model. One striking example is BP’s carbon footprint calculator, which encouraged people to obsess over their individual emissions. While personal choices matter, this kind of messaging shifts responsibility away from the corporations and systems that drive the bulk of emissions, and onto individuals who have far less power to change the rules.

Gustav’s protest at Cannes is part of a broader effort to change those rules. Across Europe, a European Citizens’ Initiative (ECI) is calling for a ban on fossil fuel advertising and sponsorship. The goal is to gather one million signatures – enough to push the European Union to formally consider legislation that would end the ability of fossil fuel companies to buy influence, credibility, and public trust through ads and sponsorship deals.

By returning his awards, Gustav is confronting an uncomfortable truth for the advertising world: creativity has been used to polish the image of industries that are driving climate breakdown. Ending fossil fuel advertising and sponsorship is a concrete step toward aligning the power of communication with the urgent need for a livable future.
