On 25 July 2020, the Wakashio bulk carrier, operated by Mitsui OSK Lines (MOL) and fueled by BP, ran aground near Mauritius. What followed was one of the worst environmental disasters the island nation has ever faced: nearly 1,000 tonnes of toxic oil spilled into a pristine lagoon, poisoning waters that sustain local communities and unique marine life.

The consequences were immediate and brutal. Fisheries that thousands of people depend on for their livelihoods were devastated. Tourism, a cornerstone of the Mauritian economy, was badly hit as the island’s famed turquoise waters turned black and slick. Fragile coastal and marine ecosystems, including coral reefs and mangroves, were smothered in oil.

The disaster also took a heavy toll on marine mammals. More than 50 whales and dolphins were killed, a shocking symbol of the broader ecological damage. Human lives were lost as well: three tugboat crew members died in the response effort.

As the spill spread, local people stepped in where official efforts fell short. Communities mobilised quickly, using improvised means to try to contain and clean up the oil. Volunteers crafted makeshift booms and absorbents, working in hazardous conditions to protect their coasts and livelihoods.

The actions of the Mauritian government in the aftermath deepened public anger and mistrust. Authorities decided to sink part of the Wakashio in a known whale nursing ground, raising serious concerns about long-term impacts on marine life. Key information was withheld from the public, including details on the type of oil spilled, the extent of ecological damage, and the status of compensation. Instead of holding powerful interests to account, the government moved to shield the corporations involved.

This catastrophe exposed how unregulated and under-regulated the global shipping and fossil fuel industries remain. Massive vessels carrying toxic fuels continue to criss-cross the world’s oceans, contributing to climate-wrecking emissions and leaving coastal communities to pay the price when things go wrong.

The Wakashio spill is a stark reminder that change is urgently needed. It underscores the importance of supporting youth and community activism that demands accountability from polluters and governments alike. It also highlights the need for stronger regulations at sea, including measures such as designating sensitive sea areas where stricter protections apply.

The people of Mauritius, and countless coastal communities worldwide, deserve oceans that are protected, not sacrificed to the profits of the shipping and fossil fuel industries.
