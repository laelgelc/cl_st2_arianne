In the middle of the Indian Ocean lies the Saya de Malha Bank, a remote and little-known part of the Mascarene Plateau that connects Seychelles, Mauritius, and Réunion. Beneath its surface is a vibrant world of life and one of the planet’s quiet climate allies.

Saya de Malha is home to a rich diversity of marine wildlife. Pygmy blue whales and sperm whales move through its waters, while flying fish and tuna weave through the currents above the plateau. This area is not just a hotspot for ocean life; it is also a powerful natural tool in the fight against climate breakdown.

Here, the world’s largest seagrass meadow stretches across the seabed. Seagrass meadows are major carbon sinks: they capture and store carbon, helping to slow climate breakdown. At Saya de Malha, this vast underwater meadow also supports an array of species, including dugongs and tiger sharks, which depend on these habitats for food, shelter, and breeding grounds.

The ecological importance of this area has been formally recognised. Saya de Malha is designated as an Ecologically and Biologically Significant Area and is under the shared governance of Seychelles and Mauritius, while parts of it lie in international waters. This mix of national and international responsibility underlines the need for strong cooperation to protect it.

Greenpeace’s ship Arctic Sunrise travelled to Saya de Malha to help shine a light on this hidden world. The expedition set out to map and document the wildlife that lives in and passes through the area. Using binoculars to spot animals at the surface, hydrophones to listen for underwater life, and environmental DNA (eDNA) collected from water samples to detect species present in the ecosystem, the team built a clearer picture of this remarkable bank and its inhabitants.

Yet even a place as remote as Saya de Malha is not safe from human pressures. Across the ocean, shark populations have plummeted, with a 71% decline driven largely by bycatch in industrial fisheries. This loss of sharks threatens the balance of marine ecosystems, including places like Saya de Malha, where top predators such as tiger sharks play a key role.

Protecting Saya de Malha and other critical ocean areas means creating strong ocean sanctuaries where marine life can recover and thrive, free from destructive activities. It also means securing robust global rules. That is why there is a call for a Global Ocean Treaty: to ensure that international waters, including areas around places like Saya de Malha, are properly safeguarded. By defending these underwater forests of seagrass and the wildlife they support, we can help protect both ocean life and the climate we all depend on.
