The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed and deepened a crisis that was already unfolding: a profoundly unequal and fragile food system, colliding with accelerating climate breakdown. As lockdowns, border closures and economic shocks rippled across the globe, billions of people faced disruptions to their access to food. This didn’t happen in a vacuum. It happened in a world where food is treated as a commodity for profit rather than a human right, where vast quantities are wasted while millions go hungry.

The industrial food system, dominated by powerful corporate interests, is at the heart of this problem. It prioritises efficiency, uniformity and short-term profit over resilience, equity and ecological health. This model funnels control of seeds, land, processing and retail into the hands of a few large companies. It drives monocultures and long, fragile supply chains that are vulnerable to shocks—whether from pandemics, extreme weather or political instability.

The result is a bitter paradox: food mountains and empty plates. While supermarkets discard edible food and agribusinesses chase export markets, communities struggle to afford basic staples. Essential workers who grow, harvest, process, transport and sell our food often face low wages, insecure contracts and unsafe conditions—yet the system cannot function without them. COVID-19 made this visible, but the injustice has been there all along.

At the same time, climate change is disrupting rainfall patterns, degrading soils and fuelling more frequent and severe droughts, floods and storms. These impacts hit hardest in communities that already face economic and social marginalisation. Food insecurity, inequality and climate breakdown are not separate crises; they are interwoven, with the industrial food system acting as both victim and driver of ecological collapse.

Transforming this situation requires a shift in power and values. Food justice and food sovereignty place people and ecosystems at the centre, rather than corporate profit. Food justice demands that everyone has access to healthy, culturally appropriate food, and that the people who produce it are treated fairly. Food sovereignty goes further, insisting that communities have the right to define their own food systems—how food is grown, who controls land and resources, and how benefits are shared.

A just and resilient food system must recognise food workers as essential in more than name. That means guaranteeing decent pay, safe working conditions and social protections. It also means wider social measures that reduce vulnerability to shocks, such as universal basic income, so that people are not one crisis away from hunger.

Policy and public investment need to be redirected towards ecological resilience instead of propping up a failing industrial model. This includes supporting diverse, localised food systems that shorten supply chains, protect biodiversity and reduce dependence on fossil fuels and chemical inputs. Governments should treat food as a common good, not just another market commodity—ensuring that everyone can access nutritious food, and that communities have a say in how it is produced.

There are practical steps people and communities can take right now that point in this direction. Reducing food waste across the chain—from farm to fork—can ease pressure on land and resources while improving access. Shifting diets towards more plant-based foods and locally produced staples can cut emissions, support local farmers and make food systems less vulnerable to global disruptions.

Urban agriculture is another powerful tool. Community gardens, rooftop farms and other city-based growing projects can increase local food availability, strengthen social ties and reconnect people with how food is produced. Community-supported agriculture schemes, where consumers share risks and rewards with farmers, can provide stable income for growers and fresh, seasonal food for households.

These kinds of initiatives are already emerging in many places. In Victoria, Canada, for example, local food-growing efforts have been supported as part of a broader push to build more resilient and equitable food systems. Such examples show how public authorities can help scale up community-led solutions—by providing land, funding, training and supportive policies.

The pandemic has been a harsh warning that our current food system is not built to protect people or the planet. As climate impacts intensify, the costs of maintaining this broken model will only grow. By centring food justice and sovereignty, valuing essential workers, strengthening social safety nets and backing local, ecological food systems, we can build a future where food is a right, not a privilege—and where our food systems help heal, rather than harm, the Earth.
