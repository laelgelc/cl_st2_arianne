Illegal mining in the Amazon is leaving a trail of destruction that reaches far beyond the forest itself. It is not only tearing down trees and poisoning rivers; it is also fueling violence, disease, and deep social wounds in Indigenous communities that have protected these territories for generations.

Across lands such as the Yanomami, Munduruku, and Kayapó, invasions by illegal miners have brought a surge in deforestation and severe river pollution. The consequences are felt in daily life: communities face diseases linked to contaminated water and environmental degradation, an increase in sexual violence and murders, and internal divisions as mining interests fracture social cohesion.

A 2022 report by the Yanomami themselves exposes the scale and depth of this crisis. It documents impacts in 273 communities and shows that more than half of the approximately 27,000 Yanomami inhabitants have been affected. The report also reveals how rapidly the mining front has advanced: areas degraded by mining have grown by 625% since 2010. This expansion has intensified contact with miners, increased exposure to violence and disease, and further contaminated rivers that are central to food, culture, and mobility.

The Yanomami report also dismantles one of the main myths used to justify illegal mining: that it brings economic progress. While some may experience short-term income, the long-term reality is starkly different. Communities are left with poverty, destroyed environments, and serious health problems, including mercury contamination. The toxic legacy of mining remains long after the gold is gone, trapping people in cycles of illness and deprivation.

Faced with this situation, Greenpeace calls on Brazilian authorities to act decisively. This means evicting illegal miners from Indigenous territories, ensuring that existing rights are fully respected and enforced, and implementing public policies that prioritize sustainable, community-centered alternatives over destructive extraction. There is a renewed sense of hope that under President Lula’s government, these measures can be strengthened and truly implemented. Protecting Indigenous lands from illegal mining is essential not only for the survival and dignity of the Yanomami, Munduruku, Kayapó, and many other peoples, but also for the future of the Amazon and the global climate.
