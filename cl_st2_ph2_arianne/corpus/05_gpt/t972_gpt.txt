Primark has just become the 20th global clothing company to commit to Detox, joining a growing list of brands that have pledged to eliminate hazardous chemicals from their clothes and the waterways that communities depend on. This marks another important step in the fashion industry’s shift away from toxic substances, but it is also a reminder that promises alone are not enough: companies must be held accountable, progress must be monitored, and any attempts at greenwashing must be exposed.

Alongside Primark, Burberry has also recently made a Detox commitment, while some brands that moved earlier—such as Mango and H&M—are already further along in turning their promises into concrete action. These leaders are demonstrating that it is possible to begin phasing out hazardous chemicals and increasing transparency. At the same time, major names like Nike and Disney are still lagging behind, highlighting the gap between what is needed and what many powerful brands are currently delivering.

The call now is for more companies—particularly influential brands like Disney and American Apparel—to step up and commit to Detox. This means not just signing onto a vision, but following a clear path to eliminate hazardous substances from their supply chains and to protect rivers and communities from toxic pollution.

The Detox pathway can be broken down into five key steps. First, brands must openly admit that there is a problem: hazardous chemicals are present in textile production and end up in our environment. Second, they need to identify and replace specific substances of concern, such as nonylphenol ethoxylates (NPEs), which are widely used in textile processing and can break down into toxic, hormone-disrupting chemicals. Third, companies must disclose their chemical discharges through credible, public systems so that communities and watchdogs can see what is being released into local waterways. Finally, they must put robust screening in place to identify hazardous substances and blacklist them from their production processes, working towards a deadline of 2019 to ensure these chemicals are fully phased out.

With Primark now on board, the momentum behind Detox is growing. The challenge is to ensure that every commitment leads to real change on the ground—cleaner production, safer products, and rivers free from hazardous chemicals—and that no brand is allowed to hide behind empty promises.
