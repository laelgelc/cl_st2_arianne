The journey to Sungai Putri forest in Ketapang, Indonesia, begins with water. Traveling along the dark, slow-moving river, the forest seems endless, its canopy closing in overhead, its sounds layered and alive. It feels remote and intact, but beneath the surface, things are changing fast.

In this peatland forest, water is everything. It shapes the soil, the trees, and the lives of the people and animals who depend on it. Peatlands are naturally waterlogged; that wetness keeps the carbon-rich soil stable and the forest resilient. But in Sungai Putri, canals cut through the peat like open wounds. These canals, built by logging company PT MPK, are draining the forest, even though the company has been under government sanctions since 2017 that prohibit this kind of activity.

As the water level falls, the peat dries out. What was once a sponge becomes tinder. In a landscape like this, drainage turns the forest into a vast, flammable mass. The memory of the 2015 forest and peat fires hangs heavily here. That year, fires raged across Indonesia, sending smoke across the region, harming health, destroying wildlife habitat, and disrupting lives and livelihoods. In Sungai Putri, the same risk is rising again as canals lower the water table and expose the peat to air and sun.

The impact is visible in people’s daily lives. Local communities here depend on the forest and its water systems to grow rice and manage their fields. When peatlands are drained, water patterns change. Rice paddies can dry out or flood unpredictably. Traditional water management systems—built on generations of local knowledge—start to fail when canals reroute and remove the water that once sustained them. What happens in the forest does not stay in the forest; it reaches directly into kitchens and onto dinner plates.

Sungai Putri is also home to extraordinary wildlife. Among its most iconic inhabitants are orangutans, with an estimated 900–1,200 individuals living in this forest. They move through the treetops, feeding, nesting, and raising their young in a habitat that has supported them for millennia. But as canals dry the peat and logging advances, the forest shrinks and fragments. Each drained patch of peat, each felled tree, narrows the orangutans’ world.

A visit to a nearby orangutan rehabilitation center makes this threat painfully real. Here, orangutans that have lost their homes—or been displaced by deforestation and habitat degradation—are cared for and, where possible, prepared for release. Watching them, it is impossible to ignore what is at stake. These are intelligent, social beings whose survival depends on intact, healthy forests like Sungai Putri. Without protection for their habitat, the risk of extinction grows.

The journey through Sungai Putri is a reminder that forests are not just collections of trees. They are living systems that support human communities and wildlife alike. Peatland forests regulate water, store carbon, provide food and livelihoods, and offer a home to species found nowhere else. When companies drain peatlands in violation of government sanctions, they are not only breaking rules—they are undermining the safety, health, and future of people and animals.

Protecting Sungai Putri means keeping its peatlands wet, its canals closed, and its forest standing. It means enforcing existing government sanctions and ensuring that destructive activities like those carried out by PT MPK are stopped. It also means listening to and supporting the communities whose lives are tied to the forest’s water and soil.

This journey ends with a clear message: forests like Sungai Putri are vital for life. Their fate will shape the future of orangutans, the wellbeing of local people, and the stability of the climate. Community action and firm government commitment are essential to safeguard these peatlands, prevent another disaster like 2015, and keep this forest alive for generations to come.
