In 1965, Thor S. Larsen began a journey that would define his life and shape global understanding of one of the Arctic’s most iconic animals: the polar bear. Over decades of fieldwork, he studied more than 2,000 bears, witnessing both the raw power and the vulnerability of a species that depends entirely on sea ice and snow.

Among his most memorable experiences were maternity den surveys in the high Arctic. These are the hidden birthplaces of polar bears, where females spend months in snow dens giving birth and nursing their cubs through the harshest part of winter. Finding and studying these dens is painstaking work in some of the most remote and hostile conditions on Earth, but it offers a rare glimpse into the most intimate and fragile stage of a polar bear’s life.

Larsen’s research did not stay confined to notebooks and field reports. As a member of the IUCN Polar Bear Specialist Group, he helped drive a landmark conservation achievement: the 1973 Agreement on the Conservation of Polar Bears. This international agreement banned most polar bear hunting, while allowing exceptions for indigenous communities whose cultures and subsistence traditions are closely tied to the species. It was a recognition that polar bears needed protection—and that conservation must respect and include the rights and knowledge of Arctic peoples.

But the context for polar bear conservation has changed dramatically since that agreement was signed. The greatest threat now is not direct hunting, but the rapid transformation of the Arctic itself.

Retreating sea ice is undermining almost every aspect of polar bear life. These animals are highly specialized hunters that depend on sea ice as a platform to catch their main prey. As the ice shrinks and becomes less predictable, bears are losing the time and space they need to hunt effectively and build up the fat reserves that sustain them through lean seasons. This loss of sea ice also affects their ability to reproduce successfully, as underfed females may struggle to carry and raise healthy cubs.

The impacts are visible on land as well as at sea. In key denning areas such as Kong Karls Land in Svalbard and Wrangel Island in the Russian Arctic, the number of maternity dens is declining. These are places that have long been crucial nurseries for polar bears. Fewer dens means fewer cubs entering the population, compounding the pressures from habitat loss at sea.

Pollution adds another layer of stress. Contaminants carried to the Arctic from far away can accumulate in the food web and reach polar bears at high levels. This chemical burden comes on top of the physical challenges of a warming, changing environment, making survival even harder for many bears.

Today, many polar bear subpopulations are in decline. The story of Thor S. Larsen’s life’s work—beginning in an era when hunting was the primary concern and leading into a time when climate change and pollution dominate the picture—underscores how quickly conditions can shift for a species so closely tied to ice and cold.

The path forward is clear in its broad outlines: international action is needed to tackle the root causes of climate change and to reduce pollution that reaches the Arctic. At the same time, critical denning areas must be protected so that pregnant females have safe, undisturbed places to give birth and raise their cubs.

The decades of research, the thousands of bears studied, and the long history of cooperation that led to the 1973 polar bear agreement all show that coordinated global efforts can make a difference. In the face of accelerating ice loss and mounting pollution, that same level of determination and collaboration is needed again—this time to safeguard the sea ice, the denning grounds, and the future of the polar bears themselves.
