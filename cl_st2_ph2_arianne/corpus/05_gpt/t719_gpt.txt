The Salish Sea is one of the most extraordinary marine ecosystems on Earth. Stretching across the coastal waters off British Columbia and the US northwest, this inland sea supports over 200 bird and mammal species. It’s a place where rich currents, cold waters, and complex shorelines come together to create a haven for life—from the tiniest plankton to some of the ocean’s most iconic animals.

But this vibrant ecosystem is now facing a serious new threat. The Trans Mountain pipeline expansion would bring a sevenfold increase in tanker traffic through these waters. Those tankers would carry tar sands oil, raising the risk of catastrophic oil spills and significantly increasing underwater noise pollution. For many of the Salish Sea’s most remarkable residents, this combination could be devastating.

Among the most fascinating creatures here is the giant Pacific octopus. Famous for its impressive size and speed, this octopus is a powerful symbol of the intelligence and mystery that define the Salish Sea. It depends on healthy, clean waters and intact food webs—conditions that are put at risk by heavy industrial ship traffic and the possibility of oil contamination.

The endangered southern resident orcas are perhaps the most well-known species at risk. These orcas are already struggling, and increased tanker noise threatens to make their situation even worse. Underwater noise interferes with how they communicate, navigate, and hunt, while the risk of an oil spill adds another layer of danger to a population already hanging on by a thread.

Sea otters, often celebrated for their cleverness and social behavior, are also vulnerable. Oil is particularly deadly for otters because it destroys the insulating properties of their fur, leaving them exposed to cold waters and toxic contamination. A single spill in the Salish Sea could have severe consequences for these animals and the kelp forest ecosystems they help maintain.

The Salish Sea is also a crucial pathway for migrating grey whales. These long-distance travelers rely on relatively undisturbed coastal waters along their migration routes. More tankers carrying tar sands oil mean more noise, more disturbance, and more risk of spills in the very waters grey whales must pass through each year.

Even leatherback turtles—record-holders in the turtle world—are part of this story. These remarkable animals, which already face numerous threats across their global range, are put at further risk by the possibility of oil spills in key feeding and migration areas. Any contamination in the Salish Sea adds to the cumulative pressures leatherbacks are facing in the ocean.

The Salish Sea’s future, and that of the more than 200 bird and mammal species that depend on it, is being weighed against the expansion of a tar sands oil pipeline and a massive increase in tanker traffic. The risks are clear: more noise, more disturbance, and a heightened danger of oil spills in an ecosystem that can’t afford another blow.

Protecting the Salish Sea means choosing to safeguard these waters and the incredible life they support—from the swift giant Pacific octopus to the endangered southern resident orcas, the vulnerable sea otters, the migrating grey whales, and the remarkable leatherback turtles. Their survival depends on decisions we make now about what kind of future we want for this coast and for our shared ocean.
