Thirty-two years after the Chernobyl nuclear disaster, its legacy is still painfully visible across large parts of Europe, Belarus, Ukraine, and Russia. Vast areas remain contaminated, communities continue to live with the health and environmental consequences, and the disaster stands as a stark reminder of how a single nuclear accident can permanently alter entire regions.

Against this backdrop, Russia’s state nuclear corporation Rosatom is moving forward with a project that repeats the same dangerous logic: treating nuclear power as a controllable tool even in some of the harshest and most remote places on Earth. The world’s first floating nuclear power plant, the Akademik Lomonosov, is being prepared for deployment in the Russian Arctic.

Originally stationed in St. Petersburg, the Akademik Lomonosov has been moved to Murmansk, where it will be fueled and tested. From there, it is planned to be towed to the port town of Pevek in the Chukotka region, where it will supply electricity. Rather than serving as a genuine solution to climate or energy needs, this project is designed to support fossil fuel extraction along the Northern Sea Route, locking in more oil and gas development in a region already under severe pressure from climate change.

The risks are profound. Operating a nuclear reactor on a floating platform in Arctic conditions introduces new layers of vulnerability, from extreme weather and ice to limited emergency response capacity. A serious accident in such an environment could have catastrophic and long-lasting consequences for fragile ecosystems and coastal communities, echoing the transboundary contamination that followed Chernobyl.

The Akademik Lomonosov is not an isolated idea. In the past, similar floating nuclear plant concepts have been proposed for countries such as Indonesia and the Philippines. These proposals raised serious concerns about safety, governance, and the potential for accidents in densely populated or environmentally sensitive coastal areas.

On the anniversary of Chernobyl, the lesson should be clear: nuclear power, especially in experimental or high-risk forms like floating reactors, carries dangers that can span generations and borders. Instead of investing in projects that deepen dependence on fossil fuels and introduce new nuclear risks, the world needs to accelerate the shift to safe, renewable energy systems that do not repeat the mistakes of the past.
