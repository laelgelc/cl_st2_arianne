The Congo Basin forest is one of the most vibrant, life‑giving places on Earth. Its dense canopy shelters a rich tapestry of endangered wildlife, from great apes to rare birds and countless other species that depend on this ecosystem to survive. But the forest is more than a refuge for animals: it is the beating heart of life for millions of people, especially Indigenous communities who have lived in and with these forests for generations.

For these communities, the forest is water, food, medicine, and spiritual sustenance. Rivers and streams flowing through the trees provide drinking water and support fish populations. The forest offers fruits, nuts, and game that feed families, as well as plants used in traditional medicine. Sacred groves and ancient trees are woven into cultural and spiritual practices, holding stories and knowledge passed down over centuries. Protecting the Congo Basin is therefore about safeguarding both nature and culture, both biodiversity and human dignity.

In recent years, scientists have revealed that the Congo Basin is also home to the world’s largest known peatland complex. Peatlands are waterlogged areas where plant material does not fully decompose, locking away enormous amounts of carbon. This makes them one of the planet’s most important natural allies against climate change. When peatlands remain intact, they store carbon safely in the ground; when they are drained, logged, or burned, that carbon is released into the atmosphere, driving global heating.

The discovery of this vast peatland system in the Congo Basin underscores just how critical this region is for the global climate. Protecting it is not only about preserving local ecosystems, but also about helping to stabilize the climate for people everywhere. Yet despite their importance, these forests and peatlands are under severe threat.

Industrial logging and agribusiness expansion, including palm oil plantations, are eating away at the forest. Trees are felled, habitats are fragmented, and the delicate balance of water and soil that peatlands depend on is disrupted. As forests are cleared or degraded, biodiversity declines: animals lose their homes, plant species vanish, and the intricate web of life that underpins the forest’s health begins to unravel.

These pressures also reduce the forest’s resilience. A resilient forest can better withstand shocks like droughts, storms, and disease. When logging and industrial agriculture push deeper into the Congo Basin, they weaken the ecosystem’s ability to recover and continue providing the essential services that people and wildlife rely on—clean water, stable rainfall, fertile soil, and carbon storage.

In response, Greenpeace is inviting people everywhere to stand with the Congo Basin and the communities who depend on it—using creativity, solidarity, and collective action.

One way to get involved is by dancing to the song “Dance for the Congo Basin” and sharing it with the hashtag #DanceForCongo. This is an invitation to use music and movement to draw attention to the forest’s beauty and importance, and to show public support for its protection. Every shared dance helps spread the message further, connecting people across borders in defense of the Congo Basin.

Another invitation is to add personal wishes for the forest to a traveling “Wish Tree.” These wishes are being gathered and carried to the UN climate talks at COP23, giving voice to the hopes of people around the world for a living, thriving Congo Basin. Each wish is a reminder to decision‑makers that protecting this forest and its peatlands must be a priority in global climate action.

In 2017, Greenpeace also invited people to join an expedition aboard the ship Esperanza to explore the peatlands of the Congo Basin. This journey aimed to bring the hidden world of peatlands to light—showing how they function, why they matter, and what is at stake if they are destroyed. By traveling into the heart of this landscape, the expedition sought to deepen understanding and inspire stronger protection for these vital ecosystems.

The Congo Basin forest and its peatlands are a lifeline for wildlife, for Indigenous communities, and for the global climate. Standing up for them means defending a living, breathing system that supports us all. Through dancing, sharing wishes, and bearing witness on the ground, people everywhere can help ensure that this extraordinary forest remains a source of life, culture, and climate stability for generations to come.
