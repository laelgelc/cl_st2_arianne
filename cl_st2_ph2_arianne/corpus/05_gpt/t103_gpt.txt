Around the world, people and communities are winning powerful victories for the climate and for nature. These breakthroughs show that when communities organize, take legal action, and refuse to stay silent, they can push governments and corporations to change course.

In the Torres Strait, Islanders secured a historic win at the United Nations by successfully challenging Australia’s climate inaction. Their case recognized the real and immediate threats that rising seas and a warming climate pose to their homes, culture, and way of life. This decision sends a strong message that governments can be held accountable when they fail to protect people from the climate crisis.

In Europe, a major new law now requires that certain products placed on the EU market – including cattle, cocoa, and palm oil – must be deforestation-free. This is a significant step toward breaking the link between everyday consumer goods and the destruction of forests and the communities and wildlife that depend on them. By setting clear rules for companies, the EU has taken an important step toward cleaning up global supply chains.

In Latin America, environmental defenders gained new protections when Colombia ratified the Escazú Agreement. This regional treaty is designed to safeguard environmental human rights defenders and improve access to information, public participation, and justice in environmental matters. In a region where environmental activism is often dangerous, Colombia’s ratification is an important move toward recognizing and protecting those on the frontlines.

Communities are also standing up to polluting industries. In Senegal, residents of Cayar took legal action against a fishmeal factory that was polluting their environment. By suing the company, they are challenging an industry model that treats coastal communities and ecosystems as expendable and demanding respect for their health, livelihoods, and marine environment.

In the United States, Greenpeace USA helped stop a so‑called “dirty deal” that would have fast‑tracked fossil fuel projects. By blocking this attempt to weaken environmental protections and lock in more oil and gas infrastructure, campaigners and allies helped keep the door open for a cleaner, fairer energy future.

In Russia, forest protection took a step forward when authorities reduced “zones of control” for forest fires by 2 million square kilometers. Shrinking these zones means more areas should now receive active firefighting efforts instead of being left to burn, an important measure in a world where climate change is driving more frequent and intense wildfires.

In the Pacific, New Zealand has moved to cut plastic pollution by banning certain single-use plastics. This action targets some of the most common throwaway items that pollute coasts, oceans, and communities. Greenpeace Aotearoa has welcomed the move while urging the government to go further, calling for wider measures to tackle plastic production and waste at the source.

Taken together, these developments—from courtrooms and parliaments to coastal communities and climate-vulnerable islands—show that progress is not only possible, it is already happening. Each win is a reminder that determined people, working together, can push powerful institutions to act for the climate, for nature, and for a more just and livable world.
