World Fisheries Day is a moment to recognise that another way of fishing is not only possible, it is already happening. Across coasts and communities, small-scale fishers are proving that innovation and sustainability can go hand in hand, even in an industry dominated by high-volume, industrial models.

These fishers are choosing low-impact practices that respect marine ecosystems and coastal livelihoods. They are also finding new ways to connect directly with the people who eat their catch, tapping into a growing market that values not just the quality of the product, but the story behind it and its connection to the health of the planet.

This emerging community is diverse. It brings together fishers, restaurateurs, retailers, NGOs and others who share a commitment to fair and sustainable seafood. They are experimenting with tools such as peer-to-peer platforms, the Internet of Things, social media and blockchain to make supply chains more transparent, strengthen trust, and ensure that value is shared more fairly along the way from sea to plate.

In the context of a global, high-volume seafood sector, these efforts are still small. Yet they offer a concrete blueprint for how a broader transition could look: one where environmental responsibility, social justice and food culture reinforce one another rather than collide.

To help support and scale this shift, Greenpeace is launching its Roadmap to Fair Fisheries. This work focuses initially on Greece, Italy and Spain, while actively seeking connections and collaboration with similar efforts around the world. It stands in solidarity with wider movements for alternative food systems that prioritise people and planet over short-term profit.

On this World Fisheries Day, the invitation is open: to fishers, food workers, communities, policymakers and allies to join in building fairer, more sustainable fisheries, and to connect local innovations into a global movement for change.
