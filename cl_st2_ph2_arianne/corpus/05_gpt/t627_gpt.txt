Growing up in Guimaras, Froilan Grate knew what an unspoiled coastline looked like. The waters were clear, the beaches clean, and plastic pollution was not yet a visible part of daily life. That changed dramatically when he first saw Manila Bay, its shoreline choked with discarded packaging and single-use plastics. The contrast between his childhood home and the polluted bay made one thing painfully clear: this crisis did not appear out of nowhere.

For Grate, the origin of the plastic problem lies in decisions made by multinational companies. Corporations chose to flood markets like the Philippines with single-use, disposable products despite the lack of adequate waste management systems. These were not communities prepared with robust collection, recycling, or disposal infrastructure. Yet they became dumping grounds for sachets, wrappers, and other packaging designed to be used for moments and then thrown away.

This realization led Grate to join GAIA (Global Alliance for Incinerator Alternatives), where he began working with communities to build zero waste systems from the ground up. Through segregation at source, composting of organics, and local recycling, these communities have shown that a different model is possible. In many places, they have managed to reduce their waste by up to 80%, proving that with the right practices and support, most of what we throw away doesn’t need to become pollution.

But even with strong zero waste programs, around 30% of the waste stream remains unmanageable. This is the fraction made up of products and packaging that cannot be reused, composted, or effectively recycled. No matter how committed a community is, there is simply no safe, sustainable way to deal with these materials. Faced with this reality, people on the frontlines are increasingly clear about what they want: for corporations like Nestlé and Unilever to stop producing these problem plastics in the first place.

Communities are doing their part. They are separating waste, composting, and recycling. They are redesigning local systems to prioritize reduction and reuse. But they cannot redesign the products that arrive on their shores and in their homes. That power lies with the corporations that continue to market and distribute single-use plastics in countries least equipped to handle them.

It is this imbalance that Grate is highlighting as he joins Greenpeace’s global ship tour. The tour aims to expose the role that major consumer goods companies are playing in driving plastic pollution, and to confront them with the impacts their products have on real people and real places. Grate’s participation is part of the broader Break Free From Plastic movement, which brings together groups and communities around the world to demand systemic change.

On board the Greenpeace ship, Grate is calling for more than public relations campaigns or vague commitments. He is calling for real action that addresses the root of the problem: the continued production and promotion of single-use plastics in places where they become pollution almost immediately. From Guimaras to Manila Bay and far beyond, his message is grounded in lived experience and in the evidence from zero waste communities: people are willing to change, and many already have. Now it is time for the corporations that created this crisis to change as well.
