Fish aggregating devices, or FADs, are scattered across the oceans in their thousands, deployed to attract fish and make industrial fishing more profitable and efficient. But along with the target species, they also attract and kill millions of other animals, devastating marine life to supply companies like Thai Union. When they break free or are abandoned, they drift for months or years, eventually becoming ocean trash or washing up on fragile coral reefs.

A typical FAD is a floating bundle of industrial materials: nets and ribbon trailing into the water, metal and bamboo frames, and a cluster of buoys and high-tech beacons on top. Those beacons often contain batteries, solar panels, LEDs, and circuitry. Together, they form a deadly magnet for marine life – and, once discarded, a stubborn and dangerous form of pollution.

In the Indian Ocean, the crew of Greenpeace’s ship Esperanza has been hauling these devices out of the water and off reef systems, dismantling them piece by piece. Instead of letting this mess of plastic, metal, and electronics go to waste, they’ve been turning it into something useful.

From the recovered FADs, Esperanza crew members salvage what they can: bamboo, metal, and nets become the basic structure for shade shelters; solar panels, LEDs, and batteries are repurposed into simple, solar-powered lamps that can provide light at night or charge small devices; electronic components are combined into makeshift power supplies. Each recovered device is a small cache of materials that can be reimagined rather than left to pollute the sea.

The crew doesn’t keep all of this hardware on board. Buoys are passed on to coastal communities, where they can support small-scale, artisanal fishing instead of industrial operations. Solar panels are shared with local “tinkerers” and repairers through a partner NGO, giving them tools to experiment with and adapt to local needs.

To help others replicate and improve on this work, a practical guide to upcycling FAD components has been published on instructables.com. Greenpeace is also inviting people to share their own ideas and creations using these salvaged materials, and to connect around this growing pool of low-tech innovation, via the Esperanza’s Twitter account at @gp_espy.

Every FAD recovered and reinvented this way is one less floating trap in the water – and a reminder that even the most harmful tools of industrial fishing can be taken apart and redirected toward community use and ocean protection.
