Bees are at the heart of our ecosystems and our food. Around three-quarters of global food crops and 84% of Europe’s cultivated plants depend on pollinators such as bees. Their work is not only vital for biodiversity and healthy ecosystems, but also for our plates and our economies, contributing an estimated €265 billion to crop pollination.

Yet bees are disappearing. One of the major drivers of their decline is the use of pesticides, including a group known as neonics, used in industrial agriculture. These chemicals expose bees to toxic substances and strip landscapes of the diverse flowering plants they need as food, leaving them without safe habitats or reliable nutrition. This combination of poisoning and food source deprivation undermines bee populations, putting our food supply and ecological balance at risk.

In response to this growing crisis, the European Commission has proposed banning three pesticides known to harm bees. European governments are due to vote on this proposal in May. This is a crucial moment: restricting only three pesticides is not enough to protect bees and the ecosystems we depend on.

To truly safeguard pollinators, there must be a full ban on all bee-harming pesticides and robust, independent testing of other pesticides before they are approved. Politicians have a responsibility to act decisively. By supporting a comprehensive ban and demanding proper testing, they can help secure the future of bees, protect our food systems, and preserve the natural world that sustains us all.
