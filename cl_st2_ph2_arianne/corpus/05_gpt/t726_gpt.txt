World Meat Free Week, running from June 11 to 17, invites people around the world to choose plant-based meals and be part of a growing movement for a healthier planet. Shifting what we eat, even for a short time, can have a real impact on the environment and on our own health.

Intensive meat and dairy production is a major driver of deforestation, as vast areas of land are cleared to make way for grazing and for growing animal feed. Today, over a quarter of the Earth’s land surface is used for grazing animals. This system doesn’t just take up space: it also contributes significantly to the climate crisis. Emissions from meat and dairy production are comparable to those from the entire transport sector when it comes to their contribution to global warming.

Meat and dairy are also the world’s largest users and polluters of freshwater. From growing feed crops to processing animal products, industrial livestock systems consume huge amounts of water and contaminate rivers, lakes and groundwater with manure, fertilisers and other pollutants.

Our diets don’t just shape the planet; they shape our bodies too. High consumption of red meat is linked to serious health problems, including cancer, heart disease, obesity and diabetes. Research indicates that moving towards more plant-based diets could help avoid as many as five million deaths by 2050, by reducing these diet-related diseases.

World Meat Free Week is an opportunity to try out practical, enjoyable ways to change how we eat. Simple steps include eating more vegetables and plant-based proteins, experimenting with new recipes and sharing meals with friends, family or colleagues. Hosting a plant-based potluck can turn this shift into a social event, making it easier and more fun to discover new dishes together.

To support these changes, Greenpeace offers a cookbook and a toolkit to help people plan plant-based meals and organise activities in their communities. Beyond individual action, cities in countries such as Mexico and Denmark are starting to promote vegetarian options in public institutions like schools and canteens, making it easier for more people to choose plant-based food in their daily lives.

By taking part in World Meat Free Week and embracing more plant-based meals, each of us can help cut emissions, reduce pressure on forests and water, and support healthier communities—one plate at a time.
