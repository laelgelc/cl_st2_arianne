The Khanty people of Western Siberia have lived in close relationship with their lands for centuries, depending on the forests, rivers, and tundra for their way of life. Their culture, livelihoods, and traditions are deeply rooted in a careful balance with nature, where reindeer herding, hunting, fishing, and gathering are all part of a sustainable existence.

This balance is now under severe threat as the oil industry continues to expand into their territories. Industrial development is seizing Indigenous lands, and the consequences are already visible: animal deaths from oil spills and the loss of reindeer pastures are undermining both the local ecosystems and the Khanty’s ability to survive in their traditional way.

The Sopochin family, Khanty reindeer herders, exemplify what is at stake. Their reindeer need vast ancestral lands for grazing and calving, and the family depends on healthy landscapes for hunting, fishing, and gathering. These lands are not simply economic resources; they are the foundation of their culture and identity.

Yet a subsidiary of Gazprom Neft plans to begin oil extraction on these same ancestral lands. Roads and other infrastructure are being built without proper consultation with the Khanty families who live there. These developments threaten crucial reindeer calving areas and vital water sources, putting both the animals and the people who depend on them at risk.

Conflicts like this are not isolated; they are described as typical and even inevitable under the current approach to resource extraction. When industrial projects move forward without respecting Indigenous rights, without meaningful consultation, and without adequate environmental protections, confrontation and harm become built into the system.

To prevent such conflicts, regulations in Russia need to align with international norms that respect the rights of Indigenous peoples. This includes recognizing their land rights, ensuring free, prior and informed consent for projects on their territories, and protecting the ecosystems that sustain them.

A United Nations delegation is visiting from March 17–21. This visit is a crucial moment to bring attention to what is happening on Khanty lands. Sending letters and messages can help ensure that the delegation is informed about the situation of the Sopochin family and other Khanty communities, and about the broader pattern of oil expansion threatening Indigenous rights and the environment in Western Siberia.
