Our oceans are in crisis, and governments are still moving far too slowly to protect them.

The UK has already promised to protect 30% of its waters as marine protected areas by 2030 and has helped form the Global Ocean Alliance. These are important steps, but on their own they are nowhere near enough. To truly safeguard marine life and help tackle climate breakdown, we need a strong Global Ocean Treaty that can create effective ocean sanctuaries all over the world, not just in individual countries’ waters.

Scientists are clear: we must protect at least a third of the world’s oceans by 2030 if we want marine ecosystems to recover and to give our climate a fighting chance. Yet while the evidence mounts, UN negotiations are dragging on, and governments continue to delay the real action that’s needed.

This makes moments like the “Our Ocean” conference in Oslo on 23–24 October all the more frustrating. Norway’s decision to host this high-profile event looks like a PR exercise rather than a platform for real solutions. We don’t need more speeches and photo opportunities; we need concrete commitments that will actually lead to large-scale, fully protected ocean sanctuaries.

Leaders must be pushed beyond empty promises. That means public pressure is crucial. One powerful way to do this is by using social media to call out inaction and demand a strong Global Ocean Treaty. By tweeting directly at political leaders and governments, people can challenge them to back up their words with real commitments that will help secure at least 30% protection of the oceans by 2030.

The science is clear, the targets are known, and the timelines are short. Now it’s up to all of us to demand urgent action to protect our oceans and to ensure that international agreements live up to what the planet so desperately needs.
