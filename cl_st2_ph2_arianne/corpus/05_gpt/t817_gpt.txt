Today marks a historic victory for bees, butterflies, bumblebees and countless other insects: fipronil, one of the most dangerous pesticides for pollinators, is finally banned in agriculture across the entire European Union.

This is a win that has been a long time coming. Fipronil has been known for its extreme toxicity to insects, including bees and other vital pollinators. In agriculture, it has been widely used as a seed treatment, coating seeds before planting. Once in the soil and surrounding environment, it can expose pollinators to harmful doses as they forage on treated plants and contaminated habitats. Its impacts go far beyond the fields where it is applied, contributing to the wider crisis of insect decline.

Fipronil also became infamous far beyond the farming world in 2017, when it was at the centre of a massive egg contamination scandal. Eggs tainted with fipronil were discovered and withdrawn from shelves, and the scandal spread across 49 countries. This incident revealed how a single harmful chemical can travel through the food system, cross borders and end up in people’s kitchens. It also exposed serious weaknesses in how our food production and safety systems are monitored and controlled.

Years before that scandal broke, Greenpeace and many others were already sounding the alarm about fipronil. Concerns over its impacts on bees and other pollinators contributed to the EU decision to restrict its use in 2013. Greenpeace campaigned for those restrictions and continued to push for a complete phase-out. Today’s full prohibition in agriculture is the result of years of pressure, evidence gathering and public demand for a safer, more sustainable food system.

But while we celebrate this important step, the fight to protect pollinators is far from over. Other highly toxic pesticides, especially neonicotinoids, continue to threaten bees and a wide range of beneficial insects. These chemicals are designed to be systemic: once taken up by the plant, they spread through its tissues, including pollen and nectar, exposing pollinators every time they feed. The science on their harm to bees and other species is extensive, and the evidence of their role in biodiversity loss is growing.

On the basis of this evidence, further bans and tighter restrictions on neonicotinoids and other harmful pesticides are urgently needed. Every delay means more damage to ecosystems that are already under immense pressure. Pollinators are essential for food production and healthy ecosystems; protecting them must be at the heart of agricultural policy.

The deeper problem is the industrial farming model that depends on synthetic pesticides and monocultures. This model drives climate change, accelerates biodiversity loss and pollutes water, air and soils. Simply swapping one toxic pesticide for another is not a real solution. What is needed is a fundamental shift towards ecological farming: farming that works with nature instead of against it, that supports biodiversity rather than destroying it, and that helps stabilise the climate instead of making the crisis worse.

Ecological farming means diverse crops, healthy soils, natural pest control, and farming systems that respect ecological limits. It means supporting farmers to move away from chemical dependence and towards practices that restore ecosystems. This transformation is not only possible; it is essential if we are to tackle the intertwined crises of climate breakdown, biodiversity collapse and pollution.

Right now, the reform of the EU Common Agricultural Policy offers a crucial opportunity to accelerate this shift. Public money should support farming that protects nature, climate and health, not destructive industrial practices. Redirecting subsidies and support towards ecological farming can help farmers transition, protect rural livelihoods and safeguard the environment.

An eco-food revolution will not happen on its own. It needs political will, strong laws, and active engagement from people across society. It also needs clear, practical steps that governments, businesses and citizens can take. There are at least 12 key actions that can drive this transformation – from phasing out the most harmful pesticides and supporting ecological farming practices, to reshaping subsidies, strengthening food safety systems and empowering consumers to choose food that is better for people and the planet.

Today’s EU-wide ban on fipronil in agriculture is proof that change is possible when evidence, public concern and persistent campaigning come together. It shows that harmful pesticides can be removed from the system and that protecting pollinators can be put above chemical industry interests. Now this momentum must be used to go further: to end the use of other bee-harming pesticides like neonicotinoids, and to build a food and farming system that truly nurtures life.

The future of our food, our climate and our biodiversity depends on the choices made today. Ending fipronil is a major stride forward. The next steps – towards ecological farming and a full eco-food revolution – must follow without delay.
