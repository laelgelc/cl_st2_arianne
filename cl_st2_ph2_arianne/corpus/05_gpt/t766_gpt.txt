Ten activists put their bodies on the line to protect land, water, and climate from a dangerous tar sands expansion project on Coast Salish territory near Vancouver, Canada.

Among them were Greenpeace co-founder Rex Weyler and the children of founders Dorothy and Irving Stowe. Together, they peacefully blocked a Kinder Morgan construction site, delaying work on a tar sands oil pipeline that violates Indigenous rights, threatens air and water, and accelerates climate change.

Their action was a clear stand of solidarity with Indigenous communities whose lands and waters are directly threatened by this project. Tar sands pipelines carve through ecosystems, endanger rivers and coastlines, and lock us into more fossil fuel dependence at a time when we urgently need to transition away from oil. On Coast Salish territory, this means putting already stressed ecosystems, and the people who depend on them, at even greater risk.

The activists were arrested for their peaceful resistance, joining a growing wave of people refusing to accept business as usual. This action is part of a broader movement that has already seen powerful displays of opposition, including a recent march of more than 10,000 people against Kinder Morgan and tar sands pipelines.

The message is simple and urgent: tar sands expansion and the pipelines that enable it have no place in a livable, just future. They trample Indigenous rights, undermine ecological integrity, and fuel the climate crisis.

Now is the time to stand with Indigenous communities, climate defenders, and all those working to protect air, water, and a safe future. Add your voice and sign on to oppose Kinder Morgan and tar sands pipelines.
