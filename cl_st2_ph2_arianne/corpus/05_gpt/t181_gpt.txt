I grew up in the Philippines at a time when bringing empties back to the store was simply part of daily life. My family would carefully save our glass Coca-Cola bottles and carry them to the neighborhood shop, where they’d be refilled and sent back into circulation. We also refilled canisters locally instead of buying endless new containers. It wasn’t framed as environmentalism; it was just how things were done. That simple system created a sense of pride and responsibility in our community. We knew that what we used would go back, be reused, and stay in the loop.

Today, that everyday culture of reuse has largely been replaced by a flood of single-use plastic packaging. Instead of sturdy bottles and refillable containers, we’re surrounded by disposable plastic from the world’s biggest brands, including Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, Nestlé, and Unilever. These companies have shifted us into a throwaway model where almost everything is used once and then tossed.

The impact is everywhere: plastic clogging waterways, littering coastlines, and breaking down into microplastics that infiltrate our environment. But the problem doesn’t start when plastic hits the trash; it starts when it’s made. Plastic is derived from fossil fuels, which means every stage of its life cycle is tied to climate change—from extraction and production to disposal. The more plastic these corporations produce, the more they fuel the climate crisis.

It’s important to be clear: this is not about individual failure. Ordinary people did not choose to flood the world with single-use plastic—corporate overproduction did. For decades, major brands have pushed more and more disposable packaging into markets around the world, especially in the Global South, while shifting the blame onto consumers and communities for the resulting waste.

There are signs that pressure is working. Governments are negotiating a global plastics treaty aimed at tackling the crisis, and some companies are starting to make public commitments. Coca-Cola, for example, has announced a goal to reach 25% reusable packaging by 2030. That’s a step, but it’s nowhere near enough given the scale of the problem and the role these companies have played in creating it.

If we’re serious about a livable, plastic-free future, the biggest corporate polluters must go much further. Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, and Nestlé should be committing to at least 50% reusable packaging by 2030. Reuse systems are not a distant dream; they are a return to practices that many communities, like the one I grew up in, already know work. Strong, binding targets for reuse and refill can help shift us away from the throwaway culture that’s driving both plastic pollution and the climate crisis.

As people and as consumers, we also have a critical role: we must refuse to be distracted by greenwashing. Slick marketing, “recyclable” labels that don’t match reality, and vague promises about the future cannot be allowed to replace real action. What’s needed is a clear, measurable reduction in single-use plastic and a massive scale-up of reuse.

The memories of returning glass bottles and refilling containers are more than nostalgia. They are proof that another system is possible—one based on responsibility, community, and respect for our shared environment. To get there, we need strong global rules, ambitious corporate commitments, and a public that won’t settle for half-measures. Only by rejecting greenwashing and demanding real change can we build the plastic-free future we all deserve.
