In April 2019, Greenpeace activists around the world confronted Nestlé over its massive reliance on single-use plastics by delivering symbolic “plastic monsters” made from the company’s own branded waste to its offices and factories.

The wave of actions began with activists crashing Nestlé’s Annual General Meeting on April 11, bringing the plastic monster directly into the heart of the company’s decision-making arena. Just days later, on April 16, coordinated protests took place across multiple countries, including Kenya, Italy, Switzerland, Slovenia, the United States, Canada, and Poland. In each location, activists used the plastic monsters to draw attention to the scale of Nestlé’s plastic footprint and to call for a fundamental shift away from throwaway packaging.

The pressure continued to build as more actions followed. On April 22, activists in Malaysia and Mexico joined the global mobilisation, again using the plastic monsters as a stark visual reminder of the pollution created by single-use plastics. One particularly striking action saw a massive plastic monster travel from the Netherlands to Switzerland via the Rhine, symbolically carrying Nestlé’s plastic waste downstream and across borders, just as real plastic pollution travels far beyond the point of sale or disposal.

These protests focused on a central fact: in 2018 alone, Nestlé produced 1.7 million tonnes of plastic packaging. Activists used this figure to underline the urgency of change and to demand that Nestlé move beyond incremental tweaks to its packaging. Across all the actions, the message was consistent: Nestlé must invest in refill and reuse systems and help #BreakFreeFromPlastic, instead of locking consumers and communities into a cycle of single-use packaging and pollution.
