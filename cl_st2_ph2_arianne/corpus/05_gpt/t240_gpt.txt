Carbon offsetting is sold as a climate solution, but in practice it functions as a dangerous scam and a powerful greenwashing tool. Instead of driving down emissions at the source, it gives corporations and governments a convenient way to keep burning fossil fuels while claiming to “cancel out” their pollution somewhere else. The promise sounds simple: keep emitting here, protect or plant trees there, and call it climate progress. In reality, this is a shell game that delays the real action the climate crisis demands.

A major pillar of this scam is the use of forest protection and similar projects as tradable carbon credits. Forests, peatlands and other ecosystems are turned into commodities in carbon markets, their carbon counted and sold so that polluters can keep operating as usual. This commodification of nature treats living ecosystems as mere units in a balance sheet instead of respecting them as home to communities, cultures and biodiversity.

These projects often harm Indigenous Peoples and local communities whose lands and livelihoods are targeted for offset schemes. Under the banner of “protection” or “restoration,” offset projects can restrict traditional access to forests, undermine land rights and impose outside control over territories that have been stewarded sustainably for generations. The climate crisis is then used as a justification to grab land and power, while the polluters buying the credits continue business as usual.

Net zero has become the political and corporate slogan that ties all of this together. On the surface, it sounds like a commitment to stop contributing to climate change. But the way net zero is commonly used is a deceptive bookkeeping trick. Instead of committing to stop extracting and burning fossil fuels, many net zero plans rely heavily on offsetting: adding up future hypothetical removals of carbon and setting them against ongoing real emissions.

This arithmetic distracts from what science and justice demand: immediate, deep and sustained cuts in fossil fuel use. Net zero rhetoric allows governments and companies to push the hardest decisions into the future, promising that offsets and carbon markets will balance the books decades from now. Meanwhile, the atmosphere keeps filling with CO₂, and communities on the frontlines of climate impacts are left to pay the price.

Offsetting is portrayed as an act of responsibility or even compassion, but the way it is deployed reveals something very different. It is a con driven by greed, designed to protect profit and delay regulation. It feigns concern for forests and vulnerable communities while using them as a dumping ground for the emissions of the rich. It preys on people’s fear of the climate crisis and exploits uncertainty about complex carbon accounting to sell a comforting illusion of action.

This illusion is especially dangerous in international climate negotiations. Under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, governments are debating rules for carbon markets and offsets. If these rules entrench offsetting as a central climate “solution,” they will lock in more greenwashing, more commodification of nature and more harm to Indigenous Peoples and local communities. Instead of focusing on cutting fossil fuel production and use, negotiations risk becoming a technical exercise in shuffling emissions on paper.

At COP26 and beyond, there is a clear need to reject carbon offsetting as a pillar of climate policy. Allowing more offset schemes under Article 6 would deepen the scam rather than solve the crisis. The path forward is not to refine the accounting tricks, but to abandon them in favour of straightforward, verifiable reductions in fossil fuel use.

What is needed is not net zero, but real zero. Real zero means phasing out fossil fuels and rapidly cutting emissions at their source, not promising to “neutralize” them with dubious projects elsewhere. It means protecting forests and ecosystems for their own sake and for the rights and cultures they sustain, not turning them into carbon warehouses for polluters. It means climate action grounded in justice, honesty and real change, instead of creative accounting and corporate spin.

Rejecting offsetting is not about rejecting responsibility; it is about insisting on genuine responsibility. That means confronting the root cause of the crisis: the continued extraction and burning of coal, oil and gas. As long as offsetting and net zero accounting tricks dominate climate policy, they will serve as cover for inaction. The choice is stark: cling to a con that lets pollution continue, or commit to real zero and the transformative changes the climate crisis requires.
