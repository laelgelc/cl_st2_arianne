In Russia, women are officially banned from working as firefighters. Yet every fire season, women step forward as volunteers with Greenpeace Russia to help protect forests and communities from devastating blazes.

These volunteers work in some of the most challenging conditions, including regions like Transbaikalia, where pine forests ignite and spread quickly. Climate change is driving more frequent and intense fires, making their work both more urgent and more dangerous. Despite this, women from a wide range of backgrounds—students, office workers, and those nearing 50—join firefighting teams while balancing regular jobs and family responsibilities.

Before they are allowed near the fire line, volunteers undergo training that focuses on practical skills and safety. In the field, what matters is not gender but competence: knowing how to use equipment, understanding fire behavior, and being able to work as a coordinated team. The women emphasize that they are there to do the same work as anyone else on the line and that their abilities are proven by their actions.

Sofya Kosacheva, for example, has led expeditions, taking responsibility for people’s safety and for making tactical decisions in difficult conditions. Anna Baskakova helped found a volunteer firefighting group, building a team from the ground up and showing that women can be at the forefront of organizing and leadership, not only in support roles. Anastasia Ivashkevich has focused on demonstrating in practice that women are fully capable of this demanding work, challenging stereotypes simply by doing the job.

Their efforts are not limited to emergency response. Volunteers also work on prevention: educating people about the dangers of burning dry grass, which can easily spark out-of-control wildfires; planting trees to help restore damaged forests; and engaging in other activities that reduce the risk of future fires. This combination of frontline firefighting and long-term preventive work reflects a broader understanding that protecting forests requires both immediate action and sustained care.

Together, these women show that courage, skill, and commitment—not gender—define who can stand on the front lines of the climate crisis.
