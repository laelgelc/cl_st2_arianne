Herakles Farms’ palm oil venture in Cameroon has become a textbook example of how not to develop land, treat communities, or run a business. From the outset, the company sought to convert 70,000 hectares of forest into an industrial plantation, despite not holding a valid land lease and facing clear opposition from local people. The project was pushed forward in the absence of basic legal and social foundations, and communities and forests have borne the cost.

Instead of engaging constructively with critics, Herakles Farms has been accused of trying to silence them. Those who raised concerns about the project’s social and environmental impacts have faced intimidation rather than dialogue. The company’s conduct has gone so far as to threaten the independence of the judiciary, undermining the very institutions meant to protect citizens and uphold the rule of law.

One of the most striking examples of this behaviour is the company’s insistence on a New York arbitration clause for employee grievances. Rather than allowing workers to seek justice locally, Herakles Farms has tried to force disputes into an expensive, distant legal process that is entirely out of reach for most employees. The company has even sought presidential intervention to enforce this clause, turning what should be a straightforward labour rights issue into an exercise in power and influence.

On the ground, the project is in crisis. Operations have been halted, and the vast plantation that was promised has barely materialised. The company has failed to pay rents and taxes, and many of the commitments made to communities and workers remain unfulfilled. Instead of delivering the development and jobs that were advertised, the project has brought layoffs and broken promises.

Despite this collapse in credibility and performance, new management and investors are still trying to keep the project alive. They are doing so in the shadow of ongoing lawsuits over unpaid wages and discrimination, with workers seeking basic justice for work already performed. The pattern is consistent: those who have given their labour and land are left waiting, while the company and its backers try to salvage a failing venture.

The repression of peaceful activism around the project underlines the wider damage being done. Activist Nasako Besingi was convicted for his role in non-violent protests against the plantation. His case is emblematic of how community voices have been criminalised instead of heard, and how legitimate concerns about land, livelihoods, and forests have been met with punishment rather than participation.

This is not the kind of development that Cameroon—or any country—needs. Large-scale land deals that ignore local rights, undermine justice, and devastate forests are fundamentally at odds with a sustainable future. Greenpeace supports a different path: one where land is used in ways that respect communities, protect the environment, and ensure that development benefits those who live closest to the forest.

The crisis surrounding Herakles Farms’ project is a warning. When companies push ahead without legal clarity, social consent, or environmental responsibility, everyone loses—except those who profit in the short term. Cameroon’s forests and communities deserve investments that strengthen, rather than sacrifice, their rights and ecosystems.
