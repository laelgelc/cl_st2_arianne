Across Southeast Asia, communities are reimagining how food is grown, shared, and valued. Among them is Langit Collective, a Malaysian social enterprise that works hand in hand with Indigenous farmers to protect traditional crops, support local livelihoods, and strengthen food resilience.

Langit Collective was founded by Melisa Lim and her friends with a clear purpose: to promote heirloom rice grown by the Lun Bawang community in Sarawak, East Malaysia. Instead of relying on conventional supply chains, they buy rice directly at farmers’ doorsteps. By paying more than twice the local market price, they help ensure that Lun Bawang farmers receive fair compensation for their work.

This approach does more than boost incomes. It encourages farming practices that are better for people and the planet, such as hand-harvesting and reducing the use of pesticides. These methods help protect the surrounding ecosystems while maintaining the quality of the rice. At the same time, Langit Collective’s work supports the preservation of more than 300 heirloom rice varieties. Each variety represents generations of Indigenous knowledge and adaptation to local landscapes, and keeping them in cultivation helps safeguard biodiversity.

Beyond rice, Langit Collective has turned its attention to food security for resettled Indigenous families in West Malaysia. The team developed a low-cost Food Forest module designed to be practical and accessible. Through this initiative, 40 households are now able to grow 24 different types of vegetables. For these families, having diverse crops close to home reduces dependence on external food supplies and puts more control over nutrition and diet back into their own hands.

The COVID-19 pandemic laid bare the vulnerabilities of global and national food systems, from disrupted supply chains to price spikes and shortages. Yet it also highlighted the resilience of traditional farming systems that are rooted in local knowledge, diversity, and community cooperation. The experience underscored why efforts like those of Langit Collective matter: they help build food systems that can withstand shocks while respecting Indigenous rights and practices.

Through their work with Lun Bawang rice farmers and resettled Indigenous families, Langit Collective shows how fair prices, sustainable practices, and community-led solutions can come together to protect both people and the environment.
