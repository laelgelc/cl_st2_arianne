Carbon capture and storage (CCS), also known as CCUS, is being sold by oil giants like Chevron and Shell as a climate solution, but their track record tells a very different story. Instead of cutting emissions, CCS is repeatedly used to justify more fossil fuel extraction while soaking up public money that should be going to real climate action.

In Australia, Chevron’s Gorgon project is one of the most glaring examples. Backed by $60 million in public handouts, it was supposed to capture a significant share of its emissions. In reality, it has managed to capture only about 2% of its total emissions targets. This colossal failure hasn’t stopped Chevron from using the project as a green fig leaf to continue business as usual.

Shell’s Quest plant in Canada shows another side of the problem. Marketed as a flagship CCS project, it has ended up emitting more greenhouse gases than it actually captures. Instead of helping to drive down pollution, it becomes yet another industrial facility adding to the climate crisis while being branded as part of the solution.

On top of these failures, CCS is fundamentally energy-hungry. Running the capture, compression and storage systems requires extra energy, which in turn drives up overall emissions. The result is a technology that can make fossil fuel operations even more polluting when the full system is taken into account.

Despite decades of hype, CCS globally captures only about 0.1% of annual CO2 emissions. That is a vanishingly small fraction of what’s needed to address the climate emergency. Much of the CO2 that is captured is not even permanently stored but used for enhanced oil recovery – pumping carbon dioxide into depleted wells to force out more oil. This directly undermines any climate benefit by prolonging and expanding fossil fuel production.

Scientists have described CCS as a pipe dream that functions mainly as a subsidy pipeline for the fossil fuel industry. Rather than accelerating the transition away from coal, oil and gas, CCS props it up. Public subsidies flow into projects that fail to deliver meaningful climate benefits while allowing companies like Chevron and Shell to claim they are taking action.

CCS in its current, industry-driven form is not a climate solution. It is a distraction that delays the real work of rapidly phasing out fossil fuels, scaling up renewables, improving efficiency and protecting ecosystems. As long as CCS is used to greenwash and extend the life of oil and gas, it will remain what the evidence already shows it to be: a costly, ineffective scam that the planet cannot afford.
