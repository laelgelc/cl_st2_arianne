Across the world, communities are waking up to a painful truth: the age of colonialism has not ended so much as changed form. Today, one of its most visible faces is plastic. When wealthy countries ship their plastic waste to African and other global majority nations instead of dealing with it at home, they are engaging in what many frontline communities and experts rightly call “waste colonialism.”

The logic is disturbingly familiar. Just as historical colonialism treated lands and people in Africa, Asia, and Latin America as resources to be exploited for the benefit of distant powers, waste colonialism treats these same regions as dumping grounds for the Global North’s plastic addiction. This practice deepens poverty, fuels health crises, and locks communities into toxic cycles of dependency and environmental degradation, all while allowing richer countries to claim they are “recycling” or managing waste responsibly.

A United Nations report has highlighted how the harms of this system fall disproportionately on marginalized people of color and low-income communities. These are the people most likely to live near dumpsites, incinerators, and polluted waterways; the people whose livelihoods are threatened when soils, rivers, and oceans are contaminated; and the people whose health is sacrificed so that corporations and governments in wealthy countries can avoid confronting the root causes of the plastic crisis.

Waste colonialism does not exist in a vacuum. It fits into a broader pattern of ongoing colonial-like practices that continue to extract value from African nations while exporting harm. Examples include France’s so‑called “colonial tax,” which has long been criticized for perpetuating economic dependence and draining resources from former colonies, and illegal fishing by foreign fleets in African waters, which robs coastal communities of food security and income. Plastic waste dumping is part of this same pattern: powerful actors profit, while local people bear the costs.

The global plastic trade has shifted dramatically in recent years. When China introduced strict limits on plastic waste imports, many Western countries scrambled to find new destinations for the flood of plastic they were unwilling to reduce at the source. Instead of using this moment to cut back on single-use plastics and redesign wasteful systems, they redirected shipments to countries with weaker regulations, fewer resources to monitor imports, and less capacity to manage hazardous materials safely.

Nations such as Senegal and Kenya have found themselves on the frontlines of this shift. Containers of plastic waste—often dirty, mixed, or contaminated—arrive under the guise of “recyclables,” overwhelming local systems and leaving communities to cope with burning, dumping, and informal handling. The result is polluted air, poisoned water, and growing mountains of waste that threaten health, livelihoods, and ecosystems.

This is not a solution to the plastic crisis; it is a way of hiding it. By exporting plastic waste, Western countries delay the hard but necessary work of reducing production, phasing out unnecessary single-use items, and building truly sustainable, just systems of reuse and repair. Meanwhile, the communities forced to live with imported waste are denied the right to a clean and healthy environment and the chance to shape their own development paths.

Ending waste colonialism means confronting the plastic problem at its source. That is why a strong global plastics treaty is urgently needed—one with binding rules that apply to all countries and hold corporations to account. Such a treaty must prioritize:

- A dramatic reduction in the production and use of single-use plastics, rather than relying on export and end-of-pipe “solutions.”
- Clear, enforceable obligations to prevent the dumping of plastic waste on countries that lack the capacity—or the desire—to manage it.
- Robust, accountable systems for waste management that protect workers, communities, and ecosystems, instead of sacrificing them for short-term profit.

Communities in Africa and across the global majority are demanding an end to this injustice. They are calling for a future in which their lands and waters are not treated as sacrifice zones, and in which environmental protection goes hand in hand with social and economic justice. Standing with them means naming waste colonialism for what it is and insisting that the era of exporting harm must end.

A fair and effective global plastics treaty can be a powerful step in that direction. It can help shift responsibility back onto the producers and consumers driving the crisis and ensure that no community is forced to shoulder the toxic burden of another’s waste. Ending waste colonialism is not only an environmental imperative—it is a matter of historical and present-day justice.
