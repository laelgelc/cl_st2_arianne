Over 5 million people around the world have called on companies like Nestlé to reduce their reliance on single-use plastics. This growing public pressure is pushing for a shift away from throwaway packaging and toward refillable, reusable systems.

One way to help drive this systemic change is by taking part in Global Refill Day on November 6. The idea is simple: bring a reusable container to a supermarket, cafe, or restaurant, ask to have it filled, and show that reuse is possible right now.

To take part:

1. Bring your own reusable container to a shop, cafe, restaurant, or supermarket.  
2. Request a refill instead of accepting single-use packaging.  
3. Take a “before” and “after” photo of your refill experience.  
4. Share your photos on social media using #ReuseRevolution and #BreakFreeFromPlastic.  
5. Tag the company you visited and @greenpeace to help amplify the message.

These actions highlight practical alternatives to single-use plastics and support the expansion of refillable systems. Around the world, initiatives such as Indonesia’s Zero Waste Living Lab, refill stations, zero waste cities, and public commitments from well-known figures are already showing how reuse can work in everyday life.

At the same time, brand audits have repeatedly identified some of the world’s biggest plastic polluters. Recent audits name Coca-Cola, Nestlé, PepsiCo, Mondelez, and Unilever among the top contributors to plastic pollution. Publicly calling on these companies to scale up reuse and refill systems is a key part of breaking free from our dependence on disposable packaging.

If you want to go further, you can connect your Global Refill Day action with wider efforts. Break Free From Plastic’s Global Week of Action offers more ways to get involved in challenging corporate plastic pollution and supporting the transition to reusable, refillable solutions.

By joining Global Refill Day and sharing your refill story, you help show companies and decision-makers that people are ready for a #ReuseRevolution and a future beyond single-use plastics.
