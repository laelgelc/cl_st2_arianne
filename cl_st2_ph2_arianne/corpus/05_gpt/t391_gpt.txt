Brazil’s Amazon is burning at levels not seen in a decade, and the destruction is no accident. Fires are being driven and intensified by policies that weaken environmental enforcement and embolden agribusiness and mining interests. As protections are dismantled, forests are cleared, land is grabbed and set ablaze, and the world’s largest tropical rainforest is pushed closer to collapse.

The impacts on Indigenous Peoples are profound and immediate. Land invasions are increasing, threatening communities whose territories have long been the strongest barrier against deforestation. At the same time, COVID-19 has taken a devastating toll: more than 34,000 confirmed cases and 837 deaths among Indigenous Peoples. These overlapping crises—violence, dispossession, and a deadly pandemic—are converging on the very peoples who have protected the forest for generations.

The Amazon is central to global climate stability and regional rainfall. As fires spread and trees are felled, vast reserves of stored carbon are released into the atmosphere, feeding a vicious cycle: more emissions drive more climate disruption, which in turn makes forests drier and more vulnerable to further burning. The loss of the Amazon’s biodiversity and its role in regulating rainfall threatens not only wildlife and local communities, but also agriculture, water supplies, and climate systems far beyond Brazil’s borders.

The destruction is not limited to the Amazon. The Cerrado, a rich savanna biome, and the Pantanal, one of the world’s largest wetlands, are also being ravaged by fires. These landscapes are being cleared and burned primarily to expand cattle ranching and soy production. In the Amazon alone, cattle ranching is responsible for around 80% of deforestation, while soy—much of it used to feed livestock—drives further conversion of forests and other ecosystems.

Behind these flames is a model of industrial agriculture and extraction that treats forests and Indigenous territories as obstacles to be removed. But the cost of this destruction is shared by everyone: from the communities losing their homes and livelihoods, to people around the world facing a destabilized climate.

Protecting the Amazon, the Cerrado, and the Pantanal means defending Indigenous rights, enforcing environmental laws, and rejecting policies that sacrifice vital ecosystems for short-term profit. It also means recognizing our collective role—whether as citizens, voters, consumers, or members of communities linked to these supply chains.

The fires in Brazil’s forests and wetlands are a stark warning. To safeguard biodiversity, climate stability, and the rights and lives of Indigenous Peoples, we must act together to stop the destruction and support those on the frontlines of protecting these irreplaceable biomes.
