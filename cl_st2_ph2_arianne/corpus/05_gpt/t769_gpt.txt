In the icy waters of the Antarctic Ocean, tiny, alien‑like creatures are quietly holding the entire ecosystem together. Antarctic krill may be small, but they are at the heart of one of the planet’s most extraordinary food webs.

These shrimp‑like animals are the main meal for penguins, seabirds, seals, fish, and the great migrating whales, including blue and humpback whales. When you picture a penguin diving beneath the ice or a whale lunging through the water with its mouth wide open, krill are often what they’re chasing. Without krill, the Antarctic would be unrecognizable – and many of the species we associate with this wild place simply could not survive.

Krill are remarkable in their own right. They can glow in the dark thanks to bioluminescence, lighting up the Southern Ocean with their own eerie shimmer. They gather in vast, dense swarms, with as many as 30,000 individuals packed into a single cubic meter of water. These living clouds of krill move and pulse through the ocean, feeding countless animals as they go.

To survive in such a harsh environment, krill have evolved ingenious strategies. They can moult their shells to confuse or evade predators, slipping away in a new skin while leaving the old one behind. When food is scarce or conditions are tough, they can even shrink in size to conserve energy, buying themselves time until the environment improves.

Beyond feeding wildlife, krill are also quiet climate heroes. As they feed and move through the water column, they help capture carbon and transport it down to the seafloor, locking it away in deep ocean sediments. This natural process helps keep carbon out of the atmosphere and plays a role in regulating the global climate.

But despite their importance, krill are under threat. Industrial fishing fleets are increasingly targeting Antarctic krill, turning them into products like Omega‑3 pills and feed for farmed fish. Removing huge quantities of krill from the ocean risks undermining the entire Antarctic food web and weakening one of nature’s own climate‑regulating systems.

To safeguard these tiny powerhouses – and the whales, penguins, and other wildlife that depend on them – there is a growing call to create the world’s largest ocean sanctuary in the Antarctic. Protecting these waters from industrial exploitation would give krill and the wider Antarctic ecosystem the space they need to thrive in a rapidly changing world.
