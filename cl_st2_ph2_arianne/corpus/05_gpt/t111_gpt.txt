The story of the Karipuna People is a story of survival against almost impossible odds—and of a new, urgent call for solidarity.

In the 1970s, the Karipuna of the Brazilian Amazon were nearly wiped out. After waves of violence and disease brought by outsiders, only eight people survived. From those eight, a people have rebuilt themselves. Today, there are 61 Karipuna, living on 153,000 hectares of officially demarcated Indigenous land in Brazil.

But the threat to their existence has never really gone away.

Their territory has been suffering massive invasions by land grabbers and loggers. Between 2015 and 2021, 4,700 hectares of their land were destroyed, placing their territory ninth in deforestation among Indigenous lands in that period. For a small people who have already come close to disappearance, this is not just an environmental crisis—it is a question of survival.

Faced with escalating invasions, death threats, and the ongoing loss of their forests and resources, the Karipuna have taken their fight far beyond the boundaries of their territory. Thirteen Karipuna, including elders, recently traveled to Brasília, the capital of Brazil. Leaving their forest home to enter the political heart of the country is not a simple journey; it is a deliberate act to make themselves seen and heard.

They carried with them a “Cry for Help” letter, which they delivered to ambassadors from eight countries, representatives of the European Union, and the United Nations. Their message was clear: the international community must act to help protect their territory and their rights.

In the letter and their meetings, the Karipuna urged the EU to reject products linked to Amazon deforestation that violate Indigenous rights. They called on European governments and institutions to use their influence and trade rules to ensure that goods entering their markets are not driving the destruction of Indigenous lands like theirs.

They also appealed for pressure on the Brazilian government to guarantee real protection of their territory. Demarcation on paper is not enough when land grabbers and loggers can invade, threaten, and destroy with impunity. The Karipuna are demanding that the promises of protection be turned into concrete action on the ground.

Chief André made the connection between global consumption and local violence unmistakable. He stressed that exported goods are stained with Indigenous blood when they come from areas of illegal deforestation and land grabbing. Behind the timber, beef, or other commodities, there are communities like the Karipuna facing intimidation, loss of their forests, and the fear of being forced out once again.

Elders who survived the near-annihilation of the 1970s are now watching the forest that sustained their recovery being cut away around them. They have expressed deep fears of being displaced, of reliving a history they have already endured once. For them, the destruction of their territory is not abstract—it is the erosion of their home, their culture, and their future.

The Karipuna’s journey to Brasília and their “Cry for Help” are a reminder that the Amazon is not an empty frontier or a distant wilderness. It is a living homeland, defended by peoples who have already paid a terrible price and who are still fighting to exist.

Their appeal is directed at governments, institutions, and consumers alike: to recognize the human cost of deforestation, to refuse products tied to the destruction of Indigenous territories, and to stand with those who are risking everything to protect their land.
