Climate change is not only an environmental issue; it is a profound human rights crisis. It threatens the right to life, to health, to a safe home and property, and to culture itself—especially for communities whose identities, histories, and ways of living are deeply tied to land and ecosystems now under siege.

Understanding climate change through a human rights lens reveals how deeply unjust its impacts are. Those who have contributed least to the problem are often the first and worst affected. This is where climate justice comes in: a global movement that insists those most responsible for the crisis—fossil fuel corporations and the governments that enable them—must be held to account.

One powerful tool in this movement is the law. Around the world, people are turning to courts and human rights institutions to demand protection, justice, and real climate action.

In the Philippines, a groundbreaking investigation has focused on the so‑called “Carbon Majors” – the largest fossil fuel companies whose products have driven a significant share of global greenhouse gas emissions. This process has sought to clarify how corporate responsibility for climate harm can be understood in human rights terms, and what accountability could look like.

In Switzerland, a group of older women have challenged their government’s inadequate climate policies. They argue that weak action on climate change violates their human rights, particularly as older people face heightened health risks from heatwaves and other climate‑related impacts. Their case shows how climate inaction can be framed as a failure to protect vulnerable citizens.

In South Africa, a court has ruled against a proposed coal plant, recognising the climate and environmental harms associated with new fossil fuel infrastructure. This decision underscores the idea that approving new coal projects is incompatible with safeguarding people’s rights and futures.

In Colombia, young people have gone to court to protect the Amazon. Their legal action asserts that the forest is essential not just for biodiversity and the global climate, but for their own rights and the rights of future generations. By defending the Amazon, they are defending their own ability to live in a stable, life‑supporting environment.

In the United States, youth are suing their government for failing to address the climate crisis adequately. They argue that this failure violates their constitutional rights by endangering their lives and wellbeing. Their case symbolises a broader demand from younger generations: that governments must act decisively to secure a livable future.

These efforts are part of a growing wave of climate litigation and human rights‑based activism that challenges the power of fossil fuel corporations and complicit governments. They show that the law can be a tool not only for resistance but for reimagining what justice looks like in a warming world.

Confronting the scale of the climate crisis can feel like facing a monster—vast, overwhelming, and impossible to defeat. But stories like these push back against that sense of paralysis. They show individuals and communities refusing to be crushed by fear or despair, finding ways to fight for their rights and for each other.

By turning to courts, commissions, and human rights frameworks, people across the globe are carving out spaces of accountability and hope. Their actions remind us that the climate “monster” is not invincible—and that collective courage, persistence, and imagination can open pathways to a more just and livable world.
