Greenpeace International recently hosted a live conversation focused on extractivism in Latin America and the many forms of community resistance rising up in response. The event took place in May as part of Greenpeace’s Roundtable Discussion series and brought together activists, researchers and community voices who are on the frontlines of environmental struggles across the region.

The conversation featured Rosario Coll and Sophie Schroder from Greenpeace’s Collective Climate Action project, who helped frame the discussion around how climate justice, local resistance and global solidarity intersect. Journalist Stefanía Dommarco moderated the panel, guiding a rich exchange between speakers working on different – but deeply connected – issues.

Panelists Gustavo Huici, Riccardo Tiddi, Juan Sarmiento Lobo, Lorena Donaire and Alejandra Jiménez Ramírez shared their experiences confronting a range of extractive threats. These included deep sea oil exploration, deforestation, mining, water access conflicts and fracking. Each contribution reflected how communities are organizing to defend their territories, protect vital ecosystems and secure basic rights in the face of powerful economic and political interests.

Throughout the discussion, Latin America emerged clearly as a key environmental battleground. The panelists showed how struggles against extractivism are never just about a single project or company. They are bound up with broader fights for sovereignty over land and resources, equity in how benefits and harms are distributed, and the protection of human rights.

The conversation also underscored how these local and regional battles are part of a wider global movement responding to the climate crisis. Alliances across borders and communities are helping connect campaigns against oil drilling, forest destruction, mining and fossil fuel expansion, strengthening resistance and amplifying demands for a just and sustainable future.
