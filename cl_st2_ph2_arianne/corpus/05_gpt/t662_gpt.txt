In Honduras, a landmark conviction has exposed both the brutality and the deep injustice faced by environmental defenders around the world.

A Honduran court has convicted seven men for the 2016 assassination of Indigenous Lenca leader and environmental activist Berta Cáceres. Among those found guilty are a military official, hired assassins, and employees of the company Desarrollos Energéticos S.A. (DESA), which was behind the controversial Agua Zarca megadam project that Berta tirelessly opposed.

Berta’s leadership, courage, and commitment to defending rivers, forests, and Indigenous rights made her a powerful voice against Agua Zarca. That same courage made her a target. Her murder was not an isolated crime, but part of a broader attempt to silence resistance to destructive projects imposed without the consent of affected communities.

Although the conviction of these seven men is a step, the trial itself was riddled with serious barriers to justice. Proceedings were marred by a lack of transparency, and Berta’s own family was excluded from key moments. Instead of a process that could have set a precedent for genuine accountability, the trial became another example of how systems often fail those who risk everything to protect their land and people.

Berta’s daughter, Laura, has denounced these injustices. She has spoken out against the way the case was handled and has vowed to continue the struggle her mother led. Her determination underlines what Berta’s life and death represent: a fight that is bigger than any single case, and a movement that cannot be extinguished by violence.

Berta’s assassination is part of a terrifying global pattern. In 2017 alone, 207 environmental and land defenders were murdered. Many of them were Indigenous women, standing at the front lines of resistance against destructive industries and projects. Their deaths expose the deadly risks faced by those who dare to protect water, forests, and territories from exploitation.

The convictions in Berta’s case do not yet reach those ultimately responsible. The call now is for justice to extend beyond the gunmen and low-level operatives to the true masterminds behind her killing. Without accountability for those who ordered, financed, and politically enabled these crimes, the cycle of violence will continue.

Protecting environmental defenders is not optional; it is essential. It means demanding real investigations, fair and transparent trials, and strong protections for communities who speak out. It also means refusing to look away when defenders are threatened, criminalized, or killed.

Berta’s struggle lives on in the voices of Laura and so many others who continue to defend their territories and our shared planet. Standing with them means amplifying their demands for justice and safety, and refusing to allow their stories to be buried.

Share Berta’s story and raise your voice for those still at risk. Use your platforms to call for justice for Berta Cáceres, for all environmental defenders, and for an end to the impunity that fuels these attacks.
