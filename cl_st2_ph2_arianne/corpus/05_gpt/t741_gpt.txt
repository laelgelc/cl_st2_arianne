I was 13 when I first saw the ocean.

Back home, in a landlocked country, the sea existed only in books and on TV – an endless blue boundary I could imagine but never touch. Moving to Australia shattered that distance. Suddenly, the edge of the continent was real: wild, windswept, and alive in ways I was only beginning to understand.

Nowhere has that felt more powerful to me than at the Great Australian Bight.

Standing at Point Labatt Lookout, the cliffs drop away to a hidden world below. On the rocks, Australian sea lions haul themselves out of the water, their pups tumbling and splashing in the shallows as they play and learn how to be at home in the ocean. It’s one of the few places where you can watch their lives unfold from above – mothers calling to their young, pups testing their flippers against the surge of the waves.

It’s beautiful, but it’s also fragile. These are endangered animals, and the stretch of coast they depend on is one of their most important breeding grounds. Their rookeries are highly sensitive to disturbance. Any change in their environment – noise, pollution, or disruption to their food sources – can ripple through the colony, affecting the pups whose survival already hangs in the balance.

Beneath the surface, another master of survival hides in plain sight. Leafy sea dragons drift through the seagrass, so perfectly camouflaged they look like floating pieces of seaweed. Their delicate leaf-like appendages move with the swell, making them almost impossible to spot unless you know what you’re looking for.

But this camouflage can’t protect them from what’s happening to their habitat. Pollution threatens the seagrass meadows they rely on, and with it, the future of these extraordinary creatures. For all their otherworldly beauty, leafy sea dragons are deeply vulnerable to what we put into the water.

The land here tells an ancient story too. At Murphy’s Haystacks, weathered granite outcrops rise from the earth like sculptures placed by some careful hand. These formations have stood through millennia of wind and weather, their rounded shapes and textured surfaces a reminder of how long this coastline has been evolving. Walking among them, it’s impossible not to feel small – and to realise how brief our own impacts could be, yet how lasting the damage.

As an ocean photographer, I’ve spent countless hours trying to capture these moments: the sea lion pups testing their strength in the surf, the ghostly outline of a leafy sea dragon suspended in green water, the soft light catching the curves of ancient stone. My camera is my way of bearing witness – to share what I’ve seen with those who may never stand on these cliffs or dive beneath these waves.

But the more time I spend in the Bight, the harder it is to ignore the threats closing in.

Plans for oil drilling and the use of seismic blasts by companies like Statoil would turn this wild, resonant place into an industrial zone. Seismic testing involves repeated, intense underwater sound blasts used to map the seafloor. For marine life that depends on sound to navigate, communicate, and find food – like dolphins and cuttlefish – that noise is not just a nuisance. It can disrupt behaviour, drive animals away from critical habitats, and add another layer of stress to ecosystems already under pressure.

Here, where sea lion pups are just learning to swim and hunt, where leafy sea dragons hover in fragile seagrass, and where the cliffs and granite outcrops hold stories older than we can fathom, the idea of filling the soundscape with explosions feels utterly out of place.

The Great Australian Bight is more than a stretch of coastline; it’s a living, breathing community of beings who have shaped – and been shaped by – this place over unimaginable spans of time. My photos are only a glimpse into that world, but I hope they help people see what’s at stake.

Because once you’ve watched a sea lion pup take its first clumsy plunge into the swell, or locked eyes with a leafy sea dragon hidden in the grass, it becomes much harder to accept that this incredible place could be put at risk.
