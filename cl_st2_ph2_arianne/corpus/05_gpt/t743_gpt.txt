Spain has exported €22.6 billion worth of arms between 2008 and 2016 to more than 100 countries. Behind this figure lies a stark reality: 50 of those recipient states have been flagged as “exports of concern” because of the clear risk that these weapons could be used to commit or facilitate human rights violations.

Among these problematic destinations are Israel, Saudi Arabia, Brazil and Iraq. These are not abstract markets; they are countries where weapons can fuel conflict, repression and suffering. Yet the deals that enable this trade are often shielded from public scrutiny. Secrecy surrounding arms exports protects the interests of the military‑industrial complex and those who profit from war, rather than the people whose lives are put at risk by these weapons.

This secrecy persists despite the existence of international and regional frameworks designed to prevent exactly this kind of irresponsible trade. The UN Arms Trade Treaty and European Union regulations are supposed to ensure that arms exports do not contribute to human rights abuses or violations of international humanitarian law. But when information about deals is hidden, citizens cannot know whether those rules are being followed, and governments and companies can evade accountability.

The problem is not limited to Spain. Around the world, arms sales are rising. Governments collectively spend about $1.7 trillion every year on war and weapons, while humanitarian responses to crises receive only a fraction of the resources they need. This imbalance reveals a global system that prioritises the machinery of conflict over the protection of people and the environment.

Greenpeace is calling for transparency as a basic first step toward accountability and peace. When arms exports are made public and subject to democratic oversight, it becomes harder for governments to sign off on deals that risk fuelling atrocities and easier for societies to demand that public money supports peace, human rights and real security instead of war.
