For decades, we’ve been sold a very particular story about mobility. The private car is presented as the ultimate symbol of freedom, success, and personal achievement. Oil companies, car manufacturers, and marketing agencies have relentlessly pushed this narrative: the open road, the powerful engine, the status that comes with owning more, bigger, faster.

But this story leaves out what happens beyond the glossy advertisements.

The long-term consequences of this car-centred model are all around us. The air we breathe is polluted. Streets are so dominated by traffic that children can’t safely play or move around on their own. Cities and landscapes are carved up by roads and parking spaces, erasing green areas and habitats. And all of this is feeding into the climate crisis, locking us into a system that heats the planet and undermines our future.

This model of mobility is also deeply unequal. Those with higher incomes are able to travel more, fly more, and own more and larger cars, which means they are responsible for a disproportionate share of greenhouse gas emissions. Yet the harms are shared by everyone. Air pollution doesn’t stop at the edge of a wealthy neighbourhood. Traffic accidents affect people in every social group. The loss of nature and the destabilisation of the climate are collective burdens, regardless of who contributed most to the problem.

The pandemic briefly disrupted this pattern. Streets fell quiet, and many people experienced what cities could feel like with less traffic: cleaner air, more space, more calm. It also exposed how fragile and unjust our current system is. When everything depends on constant car and plane use, any shock—whether health, economic, or climatic—reveals just how vulnerable we are.

Instead of rushing back to “normal”, we need to rethink mobility as a resilient, fair, and sustainable common good.

That means starting with the basics: making walking and cycling safe, convenient, and attractive options for everyday journeys. Sidewalks, crossings, and protected bike lanes are not luxuries; they are essential infrastructure that gives people genuine choices in how they move.

Public transport must be accessible, reliable, and affordable so that everyone—not just those who can afford a car—can get to work, school, healthcare, and social activities. Buses, trams, and trains can move many more people with far fewer emissions, especially when powered by clean energy.

Where cars remain necessary, they should be part of a sustainable system, not the default. Electric cars can help reduce emissions and air pollution, but only if they replace essential trips and smaller vehicles, not fuel a trend toward ever-bigger, heavier SUVs that take up more space and resources. The goal is fewer cars used more efficiently, not simply swapping engines while keeping the same wasteful model.

On longer distances, trains should be the easy, affordable alternative to short- and medium-haul flights. Choosing rail over flying should not be a privilege; it should be the most straightforward, cost-effective option for most people.

Green spaces must be woven back into how we plan mobility and cities. Parks, trees, and natural areas are not just pleasant extras. They cool our neighbourhoods, filter air, offer places to meet and play, and provide routes where people can walk and cycle away from traffic.

At its core, mobility should serve society, not the other way around. It should enhance people’s autonomy by giving them real, safe, and sustainable options to move. It should strengthen social cohesion by making streets places where people can meet, not just corridors for vehicles. It should be treated as a shared, sustainable common good—something we design together, for everyone, and for the long term.

Moving away from a car- and oil-centred system is not about giving up freedom. It’s about redefining it: from an individualistic race for speed and status to a collective ability to live, breathe, and move well—today and in the future.
