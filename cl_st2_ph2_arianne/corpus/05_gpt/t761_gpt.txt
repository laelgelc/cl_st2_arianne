Most of us are used to checking in on Facebook from our favourite café, a concert, or a holiday destination. It’s a way of saying “I was here” and sharing a moment that matters. This year, we’re asking you to use that same simple action for a place most of us will never visit—but which urgently needs our voices: the Weddell Sea in Antarctica.

The Weddell Sea is one of the wildest, most remote places on Earth. It’s home to penguins, whales and seals, and it plays a vital role in the health of our planet’s oceans. But even here, far from our everyday lives, industrial fishing vessels are moving in. They’re targeting krill—the tiny crustaceans that penguins, whales and seals depend on for food—right next to colonies and feeding areas. When these vessels deplete krill, they undermine the entire Antarctic food web.

This year, we have a chance to change that by helping create the world’s largest ocean sanctuary in the Weddell Sea. Such a sanctuary would help safeguard wildlife from the growing pressure of industrial fishing, giving penguins, whales and seals the protection they need to thrive.

You don’t need to be a scientist, a policymaker or an explorer to be part of this effort. You just need a Facebook account and a couple of minutes.

Here’s how you can join the global wave of support:

1. Open Facebook and start a new post.
2. In the location field, search for “Weddell Sea” and select it to check in.
3. Add a short comment about why protecting Antarctica matters to you.
4. Include the petition link: www.protecttheantarctic.org
5. Post—and then invite your friends to do the same.

A mass of check-ins from around the world can turn an invisible, distant ocean into a place people recognise and talk about. When your friends see you “at” the Weddell Sea, they’ll ask questions, they’ll learn, and many will add their voices by signing the petition and checking in themselves. That simple act can help build the public pressure needed to secure strong protection for this extraordinary part of our planet.

By turning a familiar social media habit into a statement of solidarity with Antarctic wildlife, we can help give penguins, whales and seals a safer future. Let’s fill Facebook with check-ins to the Weddell Sea and show that this remote ocean is not forgotten—and must be protected.
