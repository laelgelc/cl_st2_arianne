The first thing that hits you is the sound. Not the roar of engines or crashing waves, but a layered chorus: the distant crack of ice, the slap of water against the hull, and the constant, comic chatter of penguins arguing on a pebble beach.

Sailing on Greenpeace’s ship Arctic Sunrise into the Antarctic feels like slipping into another world. The water is scattered with glittering ice floes, each one catching the light differently as the ship moves. Onshore, penguin colonies crowd the beaches, tiny figures in their black-and-white tuxedos, shuffling, sliding, and calling to each other. From a distance they look almost identical, but when you spend time watching them, their personalities start to emerge in small, stubborn gestures.

The beauty of this place is disarming. It’s easy, standing on deck, to feel as if you’ve reached the edge of something untouched and eternal. But it doesn’t take long before the signs of change appear.

Climate change is not an abstract concept in Antarctica; it’s written directly into the landscape. The calving of the Larsen C iceberg is one of the stark examples of a warming world reshaping the continent. Massive structures of ice that have held together for centuries are now breaking away. Around the ship, melting ice is more than a visual spectacle—it’s a reminder that the balance sustaining this frozen ecosystem is under pressure.

Even the smallest life here tells a story. There are species like Antarctic moss that have adapted to survive in extreme conditions most of us can barely imagine: long, dark winters, brutal winds, and freezing temperatures. These mosses cling to rock and ice, quietly enduring. Yet even they are now under threat as temperatures rise and the environment they evolved for begins to shift under their feet.

Daily life aboard the Arctic Sunrise is far less romantic than the scenery might suggest. The crew and campaigners share a routine that keeps the ship running and the mission moving forward: cleaning, maintenance, regular meetings to plan the day’s work. Everything depends on the weather. A window of calm might mean a chance to launch smaller boats or equipment; a sudden change can cancel plans in an instant. Seasickness is a frequent, unwelcome companion, especially when the ocean turns rough and the ship begins to heave.

In between the tasks and the queasy stomachs, there are moments that feel almost unreal. Watching penguins in their own world, you see how perfectly they belong here—how their bodies, their movements, their entire lives are shaped by ice and sea. They are strong in their element, but that strength is fragile, because it depends completely on a stable environment. Standing there, it’s impossible not to feel a sense of responsibility to protect them and everything their home represents.

Greenpeace’s work in the Weddell Sea adds another layer to this experience. Using submersibles, researchers are exploring the deep, cold waters to gather data and identify new species living far below the surface. Each dive expands our understanding of how rich and complex Antarctic marine life truly is. These discoveries are not just scientific milestones; they are evidence that can help drive protection.

All of this feeds into a clear goal: creating an Antarctic Ocean Sanctuary. Such a sanctuary would help shield this vulnerable region and its wildlife from industrial threats, including intensive krill fishing. Krill are small, but they are a cornerstone of the Antarctic food web. Protecting them means protecting penguins, whales, seals, and countless other species that depend on this tiny crustacean for survival.

The journey to get here was long and exhausting—starting in Seoul and ending at the bottom of the world is not a simple trip. But every hour spent in transit feels worthwhile when you’re standing on the deck of the Arctic Sunrise, watching ice floes drift past and penguins gather on the shore. The hardships of travel, the cramped ship life, the bouts of seasickness—all of it fades next to the urgency and the privilege of witnessing this place at such a pivotal moment.

Antarctica leaves you with a deep sense of contradiction: a landscape that looks timeless but is changing fast; animals that seem tough yet are incredibly vulnerable to forces they cannot see. That tension is precisely why this work matters. To see the Antarctic is to understand, in a very immediate way, what is at stake—and why protecting it is not optional, but essential.
