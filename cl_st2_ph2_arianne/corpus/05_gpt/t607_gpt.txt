For years, Indigenous Peoples have been clear: their right to free, prior, and informed consent must be respected. At the UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, this right is once again at the centre of global attention. Yet on the ground, especially in places targeted by the oil industry, it continues to be violated.

In Western Siberia, in the village of Numto, this conflict is painfully visible. Numto lies within a protected area, the Numto Natural Park, and is home to Khanty and Nenets reindeer herders whose lives, cultures, and identities are inseparable from the land. Their pastures, migration routes, and sacred places are being encircled by oil infrastructure, as the company Surgutneftegas pushes deeper into the region.

Local people are facing multiple threats from this expansion. Oil drilling brings the destruction of land that is vital for reindeer herding and traditional livelihoods. It also carries the constant risk of spills and pollution, which could poison water, soil, and the fragile ecosystems that sustain both people and animals. As new roads and industrial sites carve up the landscape, herders are increasingly isolated, cut off from traditional routes and from the wider world.

Many residents describe feeling as if they are imprisoned in their own homeland. Access to the area is tightly controlled; journalists and independent observers struggle to enter, making it difficult to document what is happening. The consultations that are supposed to ensure free, prior, and informed consent are reported as being little more than a formality, with decisions effectively made in advance and local voices sidelined.

Those who resist this process face serious consequences. Officials who opposed the re-zoning of protected areas within Numto Natural Park have been fired, sending a clear message to others who might dare to stand up for Indigenous rights and environmental protection. This creates a climate of fear that further undermines any possibility of genuine consent.

The situation in Numto exposes the gap between international commitments discussed at the UN and the reality in places where oil companies operate. The rights of Indigenous Peoples to decide what happens on their lands are not abstract principles; they are essential protections against environmental destruction and cultural erasure.

You can help by sharing the story of Numto and the Khanty and Nenets reindeer herders whose lives are being disrupted by oil drilling. Raising awareness puts pressure on decision-makers who would prefer this to remain hidden. You can also contact Surgutneftegas and demand that the company respect Indigenous rights, halt destructive activities, and ensure that any decisions about the land are made with the genuine, free, prior, and informed consent of the people who call Numto home.
