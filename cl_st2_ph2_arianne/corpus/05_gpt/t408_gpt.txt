Movie director Wang Shaudi treats filmmaking not just as a profession, but as a form of social movement and personal growth. Her work reflects a deep concern for how societies develop, how people live together, and how we coexist with the environment.

In her 2003 film *Banquet*, Wang explored the tension between environmental conservation and economic development in Taiwan. To make the story as grounded as possible, she engaged in fieldwork and consulted with experts, bringing real-world perspectives into her creative process. Through this work, she highlighted how climate change is increasing pressure on the land, underscoring that environmental issues are not abstract—they are already reshaping the places where people live.

Her activism extends beyond the screen. Wang has spoken out against nuclear energy and has supported marriage equality, showing how her values cut across environmental and social justice issues. In her daily life and on film sets, she translates these values into concrete actions: promoting waste sorting during production and choosing low-impact ways of getting around, such as using a walking bicycle. These choices reflect her belief that environmental responsibility begins with everyday habits.

At the same time, Wang has openly acknowledged feelings of powerlessness in the face of escalating extreme weather events, such as the fires in Australia and floods in China. These disasters make the climate crisis feel overwhelming, even for someone deeply engaged in advocacy and creative work. Yet she continues, drawing strength from powerful images that connect art, people, and the environment—like the sight of an indigenous musician playing music on a beach strewn with trash. For Wang, such moments capture both the damage already done and the possibility of change.

Her message is clear: while the scale of the climate crisis can be daunting, individual and collective lifestyle adjustments still matter. By rethinking how we live, work, and create, she believes we can move toward a better future—one in which art and activism reinforce each other in the struggle for a livable planet.
