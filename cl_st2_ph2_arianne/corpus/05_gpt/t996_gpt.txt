Dorothy Stowe’s life traced a path from a working-class Rhode Island childhood to the heart of a global movement for peace and the environment. When she died on July 23, 2010, in Vancouver at the age of 89, she left behind not only the formal legacy of having co‑founded Greenpeace, but also a powerful example of how personal conviction, sustained over a lifetime, can help change the world.

Born in 1920 in Rhode Island to Jewish immigrant parents, Dorothy grew up in a family shaped by the experience of starting over in a new country. She went on to study English and philosophy, disciplines that helped deepen the ethical and critical foundations that would later inform her activism. Instead of pursuing a purely academic path, she became a psychiatric social worker, bringing her skills into direct contact with people’s daily struggles and mental health needs.

During the McCarthy era, a time marked by political fear and repression in the United States, Dorothy stepped into a leadership role in the labour movement. She led a union in that fraught climate, standing up for workers’ rights and democratic values when doing so carried real personal and professional risk. This early union work reflected the same courage and commitment to justice that would later define her environmental and peace activism.

In 1953, Dorothy married Irving Stowe. Together, they became deeply engaged in campaigning against nuclear weapons, drawing inspiration from Quaker principles of peace, nonviolence, and moral witness. Their activism was not abstract or distant: it was rooted in a shared belief that ordinary people have a responsibility to resist policies that threaten life and dignity.

Their journey as a family and as activists took them across continents. Dorothy and Irving first immigrated to New Zealand, and later moved to Canada. In their new home, they continued to build networks of resistance and solidarity. In 1968, alongside like‑minded friends and allies, they helped form the Don’t Make a Wave Committee in Vancouver. This committee emerged in response to U.S. nuclear weapons testing and brought together people who believed that direct, peaceful action at sea could confront these tests in a way that captured public attention.

The Don’t Make a Wave Committee became the launching pad for a bold experiment in activism. In 1971, the group organized a small vessel to sail toward the U.S. nuclear test site in the North Pacific. That first Greenpeace voyage did not physically halt the test, but it generated powerful public pressure and international scrutiny. The moral force of that journey contributed to growing opposition that helped push the United States to end its nuclear tests in the region.

Out of this experience, the Don’t Make a Wave Committee evolved into something larger. In 1972, the group took on a new name: Greenpeace. What began as a small circle of committed activists, including Dorothy and Irving Stowe, grew over time into a global organization. Today, Greenpeace works on a wide range of environmental issues worldwide, but its origins remain rooted in the anti‑nuclear, peace‑driven activism that Dorothy helped to shape.

Dorothy’s influence extended well beyond formal roles. She inspired generations of activists from many countries and movements, not only through public campaigns but also through the way she welcomed and encouraged people in her own home. Over the years, she hosted figures such as Bono and Kumi Naidoo, reflecting the breadth of her connections and the respect she commanded across artistic, social justice, and environmental circles.

What stands out most in Dorothy Stowe’s story is her unwavering dedication to peace, justice, and ecology across the decades. From union organizing in the shadow of McCarthyism, to anti‑nuclear campaigning based on Quaker ethics, to helping launch what would become a global environmental organization, she lived her values consistently and courageously. Her life offers a reminder that enduring change often begins with small groups of people, grounded in conscience and solidarity, who refuse to accept the status quo.

Dorothy’s death in Vancouver closed a long and remarkable chapter, but the movement she helped to start continues to grow. The global reach of Greenpeace today carries forward the spirit of that first voyage and the moral clarity that guided Dorothy Stowe: that the struggle for peace, social justice, and ecological integrity is one and the same, and that every person has a role to play in it.
