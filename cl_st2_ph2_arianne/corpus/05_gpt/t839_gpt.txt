Fast fashion has transformed our wardrobes – and our planet – at a staggering pace. In just a few decades, companies like H&M and Zara have helped double global clothing production to around 100 billion garments every year. Clothes are cheaper and more abundant than ever, but they’re also being worn for less and less time before ending up in overflowing landfills.

This overproduction and underuse are two sides of the same problem. Low prices and constantly changing trends encourage us to buy more than we need, often to satisfy emotional needs rather than practical ones. A quick shopping hit can feel like a reward, a distraction, or a way to reinvent ourselves – but that momentary high comes with a hidden cost. When clothes are treated as disposable, their true value is lost, and the environmental impact multiplies.

The way we use our clothes matters just as much as how they’re made. Simply doubling the average lifespan of a garment from one year to two can cut its carbon emissions by 24%. That longer life also means saving precious resources like water and fossil fuels that would otherwise go into making yet more new clothes. Keeping what we already own in use for longer is one of the most powerful, immediate steps we can take to reduce fashion’s footprint.

Breaking the fast fashion addiction starts with rethinking our relationship with our wardrobes. Instead of chasing endless hauls and micro-trends, we can rediscover what fashion is really about: creativity, self-expression, craftsmanship and care. Slowing down doesn’t mean giving up style; it means choosing it more intentionally.

The Fashion Revolution movement is showing how joyful and community-based this shift can be. Around the world, people are coming together to:

- Learn sewing skills and basic repairs so a missing button or small tear doesn’t send a garment to the bin.
- Upcycle old pieces into something new, personal and unique.
- Organise and join clothing swaps to refresh their style without buying new.
- Embrace secondhand shopping as a first choice, not a last resort.

Initiatives like Haulternatives encourage people to replace traditional shopping hauls with more sustainable alternatives – from swapping and thrifting to customising and restyling what they already own. Challenges and maps help people find local events and secondhand options, making it easier to choose better. And sharing “clothing love stories” – the memories, meanings and milestones attached to what we wear – reminds us that garments are more than products; they’re part of our lives.

By changing how we see, use and care for our clothes, we can help turn the tide on overconsumption. Every extra wear, every repair, every swap is a small act of resistance against a system built on disposability. Together, we can move away from fast fashion and towards a future where what we wear reflects not just our style, but our values.
