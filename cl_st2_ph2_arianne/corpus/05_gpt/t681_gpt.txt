More than half of the world’s population already lives in cities, and by 2050 that figure is projected to reach 70%. As our urban areas grow, so does the urgency to decide what kind of cities we want to live in: ones built around cars, or ones built around people.

Cars dominate our streets, our air, and our public spaces. They bring noise and exhaust, take up enormous amounts of space, and contribute significantly to climate change. The impact on our health is profound. Air pollution from traffic and other sources kills an estimated 4.2 million people every year. Behind every one of those numbers is a person whose life has been cut short by the toxic air we breathe.

A recent Greenpeace report warns that we have only ten years left to phase out fossil fuel vehicles if we are to avoid the worst impacts of the climate crisis. This is not a distant, abstract deadline. It is a clear signal that the way we move through our cities must change — and fast.

But this transformation is not just about what we stand to lose; it is about what we can gain. When cities reclaim streets from cars and return them to people, the benefits are immediate and visible. On a car-free day in Paris in 2015, nitrogen dioxide levels fell by 40% and noise pollution was cut in half. For residents, that meant cleaner air in their lungs, quieter streets outside their windows, and a glimpse of what a different kind of city could feel like.

Imagine cities that are clean, connected, and community-focused. Streets lined with trees and parks instead of parked cars. Safe, wide pavements and cycling paths that make walking or biking the easiest and most pleasant choice. Children able to play outside without the constant danger and roar of traffic. Public spaces where people can meet, talk, and build community rather than just pass each other in isolated metal boxes.

To get there, cities need to invest in renewable-powered public transport that is reliable, affordable, and accessible to everyone. Electric car sharing can help cover trips that still need vehicles, without requiring every household to own a car. Active transport infrastructure — like protected bike lanes and pedestrian-friendly streets — makes it possible for people to choose healthier, low-carbon ways of getting around.

These changes also help cool our cities. Less traffic and more green spaces mean lower temperatures, cleaner air, and more resilient communities in the face of a warming world.

The choice is clear. As urban populations grow, we can continue to pour resources into car-centric infrastructure that harms our health and the climate, or we can redesign our cities around people, not cars. By phasing out fossil fuel vehicles within the next decade and prioritizing clean transport, green spaces, and shared solutions, we can build cities that are not only more sustainable, but also more vibrant, healthy, and humane places to live.
