In cities dominated by cars, everyday life becomes a constant negotiation with danger, noise, and pollution. This car-centric model not only damages the climate, it also erodes the quality of urban life. Greenpeace has repeatedly called out major manufacturers like Volkswagen for their role in fuelling this crisis, but the impacts are felt most sharply on the ground—on pavements, buses, and bike lanes—by people who are simply trying to move safely through their own neighbourhoods.

The experiences of six women show how deeply our current mobility systems fail those who are not behind the wheel. For mothers, even a short trip with their children can feel risky and stressful. Cracked or narrow sidewalks force prams and small children dangerously close to traffic. Streets are lined with parked cars instead of trees or benches, and safe, open spaces for children to play are scarce or cut off by busy roads. What should be simple—walking to school, visiting a playground, meeting friends—becomes a daily struggle against unsafe infrastructure and car dominance.

For disabled people, the city’s message is often brutally clear: you are an afterthought. Accessible parking is limited, poorly designed, or blocked. Pavements are cluttered with obstacles, from poles and signage to cars parked halfway across the curb. Broken or missing ramps, high curbs, and uneven surfaces turn short trips into exhausting, risky journeys. Every barrier sends the same signal: mobility is a privilege reserved for those who can drive, not a right that belongs to everyone.

Others rely on public transport or bikes because they cannot or choose not to drive. Their stories reveal another layer of inequality. Buses and trains are infrequent, overcrowded, or unreliable, forcing people to endure long waits and complicated journeys. Poor lighting, isolated stops, and inadequate safety measures make many feel vulnerable, especially at night. Cyclists are left to navigate fragmented or non-existent bike lanes, squeezed between fast-moving traffic and parked cars, constantly at risk. For them, sustainable choices come with a cost: time, stress, and fear.

These women’s experiences expose a simple truth: when cities are built around cars, they fail the people who live in them—especially the most vulnerable. Children, older people, disabled people, women, and those with lower incomes are hit hardest. They breathe more polluted air, face more dangers on the street, and have fewer real choices in how they move.

Transforming this reality demands ambitious policies that put people and the climate first. That means investing in fast, reliable, and affordable public transport so that no one is forced to own a car just to access work, education, or healthcare. It means creating safe, continuous networks for walking and cycling, with protected bike lanes, wide and obstacle-free pavements, and safe crossings that prioritise people over traffic flow. It means reclaiming space from cars to build parks, playgrounds, and green corridors that cool our cities, clean the air, and give children room to play.

Universal accessibility must be at the heart of these changes. Every stop, station, pavement, and crossing should work for everyone—whether they are pushing a stroller, using a wheelchair, walking with a cane, or carrying heavy bags. True #MobilityForAll means designing cities where no one is left behind because of their body, income, or postcode.

European Mobility Week 2021 is a moment to push for this radical transformation. The #MobilityForAll campaign calls on decision-makers to rethink urban transport from the ground up: to challenge the power of the car industry, including manufacturers like Volkswagen; to phase out polluting vehicles; and to build cities where clean air, safety, and freedom of movement are non-negotiable rights.

The stories of these six women are not isolated complaints—they are a warning and a call to action. By listening to those who struggle most in our current system, we can build cities that work better for everyone. Shifting away from car dominance toward sustainable, accessible, and people-centred mobility is not only essential for the climate; it is the key to fairer, healthier, and more liveable cities for all.
