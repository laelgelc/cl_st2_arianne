Antarctica is changing faster than many of us ever imagined. As ice melts, ecosystems shift and wildlife struggles to adapt, the need for independent, well-funded scientific research and effective conservation has never been more urgent. Understanding how this fragile region is responding to climate change is essential to protecting the wildlife and ocean systems that depend on it, and to informing decisions made far beyond the polar seas.

Funding is central to that effort. Robust, transparent support for science and conservation can help track the health of Antarctic ecosystems, guide the creation and management of marine protected areas, and monitor the impacts of industry and a warming climate. But where that money comes from – and what strings may be attached – matters.

This is why the announcement of a new Antarctic research fund by Aker Biomarine, one of the world’s largest krill fishing companies, demands careful scrutiny. On the surface, a major commercial player offering money for science in a rapidly changing region sounds positive. Yet when the donor is directly profiting from the very ecosystem under threat, there is a real risk that such initiatives function less as genuine support for conservation and more as greenwashing.

Krill are a keystone species in the Southern Ocean. These tiny crustaceans are the foundation of the Antarctic food web, sustaining whales, penguins, seals and many other species. Without abundant, healthy krill populations, the entire ecosystem is at risk. Their role is so fundamental that any large-scale industrial pressure on krill should raise serious alarm.

Despite this, krill are being harvested to produce supplements and animal feed. In the context of accelerating climate change and ocean acidification, this exploitation is deeply concerning. The Southern Ocean is already under stress as waters warm and become more acidic, affecting the very conditions krill need to survive and reproduce. Adding industrial fishing pressure to an ecosystem already being reshaped by the climate crisis is a recipe for further instability.

Against this backdrop, claims that krill fishing can be certified as sustainable must be treated with caution. Greenpeace has raised significant concerns about such assurances, including in a paper opposing the certification of Aker Biomarine’s krill fishery. When a company whose business model depends on extracting a keystone species funds research in the same region, it risks blurring the line between independent science and corporate reputation management.

Antarctica and the Southern Ocean need more research, better monitoring and stronger protection. They also need funding that is free from conflicts of interest, and that puts the integrity of ecosystems and the precautionary principle ahead of commercial gain. As environmental change accelerates, the world cannot afford to confuse corporate greenwashing with genuine commitment to conservation.
