Commercial whaling belongs in the past, not in any credible vision of a sustainable future. Its legacy is one of devastation: industrial-scale hunting pushed many whale species to the brink of extinction, mirroring the way industrial fishing has stripped the oceans of large fish like tuna and cod. Even today, the scars of that exploitation are visible in depleted populations and fragile ecosystems struggling to recover.

Whales are not just charismatic animals; they are fundamental to the health of the oceans. As long‑lived, slow‑breeding species, they are especially vulnerable to hunting. When a whale is killed, it can take decades for a population to replace that single individual—if it can at all. This vulnerability is compounded by the fact that we still do not know how many whales once swam in the oceans, nor how close current populations are to any meaningful notion of recovery. Without that basic knowledge, any claim that it is “safe” to resume commercial whaling rests on guesswork.

Our ignorance goes deeper. Scientists are still discovering new whale species and uncovering complex cultures and social behaviours within populations already known to science. From distinct vocal “dialects” to unique feeding and migratory traditions, these cultural traits can be passed down through generations. Hunting does not just remove bodies from the sea; it can erase entire cultural lineages and behaviours that we barely understand.

Whales also play a critical role in maintaining ocean health and helping to regulate the climate. Through their movements and feeding, they transport and recycle nutrients throughout the water column and across vast distances. This nutrient cycling supports the productivity of marine ecosystems. Removing whales undermines these natural processes, weakening the very systems that help buffer the planet against climate breakdown.

On top of that, whales accumulate toxins over their long lives, making their meat a poor choice for human consumption. Hunting them for food ignores the reality that they can carry high levels of pollutants, posing risks to people as well as to the animals themselves.

Crucially, direct killing is only one of the threats whales face. Many die from ship strikes, entanglement in fishing gear, and other human activities. These indirect deaths are already taking a serious toll, even in the absence of full‑scale commercial whaling. Adding deliberate hunting on top of these pressures would push some populations beyond their limits.

Whales do not recognize national borders. They migrate across entire ocean basins, moving through the waters of many countries and the high seas. No single nation can claim to manage “its” whales sustainably when these animals are shared by the world. Any decision to resume commercial whaling has consequences far beyond one country’s jurisdiction.

The unfolding climate crisis adds another layer of uncertainty. Changing ocean temperatures, acidification, shifting prey distributions and altered migration routes all affect whales in ways we are only beginning to understand. In such an unpredictable context, opening the door to renewed hunting is reckless. We cannot reliably predict how climate impacts and whaling would interact, or how much additional pressure whale populations can withstand.

History shows that when commercial whaling is allowed, over‑exploitation follows. The economic logic of hunting for profit drives fleets to take more and more until populations collapse. There is no convincing evidence that a truly precautionary, tightly limited commercial whaling industry can resist these pressures in the long term.

Finally, there is no compelling economic need or broad public demand for whale meat. In a world with countless alternative sources of protein and livelihoods, killing whales for commercial gain is unnecessary. It is a choice, not a necessity—and it is a choice that comes at a high ecological and ethical cost.

Taken together, these realities point in a single direction. Even where some whale populations are showing signs of recovery, that progress is fragile and incomplete. With whales still facing pollution, climate disruption, ship strikes, entanglement and habitat degradation, the responsible path is not to restart the very industry that once drove them to the edge. It is to consign commercial whaling to history and focus instead on protecting whales and the ocean systems they help sustain.
