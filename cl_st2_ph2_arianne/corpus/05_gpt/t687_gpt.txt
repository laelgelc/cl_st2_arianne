For years, Greenpeace has been exposing how palm oil is driving the destruction of some of the world’s most precious rainforests. These forests are home to incredible biodiversity and are vital in the fight against climate change, yet they continue to be cleared to make way for palm oil plantations.

Major global brands – including the makers of KitKat, Colgate, Dove, and many other everyday products – are still deeply entangled in this destruction. Investigations show that these brands are sourcing palm oil from 24 of 25 notorious companies operating in Southeast Asia. Since 2015, those companies have been responsible for destroying more than 130,000 hectares of rainforest.

The damage goes far beyond trees being felled. Alongside the loss of forest, there are serious and ongoing problems of worker exploitation, conflicts with local communities, illegal deforestation, and fires linked to palm oil operations. These impacts fall heaviest on the people and ecosystems living closest to the plantations, but they also affect the global climate and all of us who depend on a stable planet.

This is happening despite public promises. Back in 2010, many of these brands pledged that they would only buy palm oil from responsible suppliers and would help end deforestation in their supply chains. Yet they continue to source from companies with well-documented links to forest destruction, often through the world’s largest palm oil trader, Wilmar. By continuing to buy from Wilmar without demanding real change, brands are still using what Greenpeace calls “dirty” palm oil.

Greenpeace is calling on these companies to finally live up to their commitments. Brands must prove that the palm oil they use does not come from forest destruction, worker abuse, or land grabs. That means full transparency over where their palm oil comes from and cutting ties with suppliers that continue to destroy rainforests.

Public pressure is essential to make this happen. People have the power to demand that the companies behind popular products stop driving deforestation and human rights abuses. By speaking out and calling on brands to clean up their supply chains, we can help protect rainforests, support affected communities, and push the palm oil industry toward real, lasting change.
