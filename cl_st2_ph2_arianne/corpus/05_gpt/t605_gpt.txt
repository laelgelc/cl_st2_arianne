For decades, Monsanto aggressively marketed its flagship herbicide Roundup, whose active ingredient is glyphosate, as safe for farmers, consumers, and the environment. Yet mounting evidence from scientific studies, court cases, and internal industry documents has revealed a very different story—one of deception, data manipulation, and the silencing of critical voices.

Farmers like Tralee Snape, who developed non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma after years of using Roundup, have become emblematic of the human toll behind the product’s glossy safety claims. Their experiences helped expose how Monsanto worked to protect its blockbuster chemical, even as evidence of harm accumulated. In case after case, juries have found that Monsanto failed to warn users about the cancer risks associated with glyphosate exposure. Courts have awarded billions in damages, not only for negligence but for what they concluded was a deliberate cover‑up of danger.

A key part of this story lies in how safety data were generated and presented. Laboratory testing, which should be an impartial safeguard, was itself compromised. Firms such as Craven Laboratories, hired to conduct safety studies on pesticides including glyphosate, were found to have falsified test results. This manipulation of core toxicology data helped sustain the narrative that glyphosate was benign, despite red flags.

Beyond fraudulent lab work, Monsanto and its allies are accused of systematically shaping the scientific record in their favor. Internal documents and court evidence have revealed patterns of ghostwriting: company employees drafting supposedly “independent” scientific reviews that were then published under the names of outside academics. These ghostwritten papers routinely downplayed or dismissed cancer risks, reinforcing regulatory decisions that kept glyphosate on the market and bolstered Monsanto’s public messaging that Roundup was safe.

When independent scientists and institutions raised concerns, Monsanto did not simply disagree—it pushed back hard. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), a specialized cancer research body, classified glyphosate as “probably carcinogenic to humans.” In response, Monsanto mounted a coordinated campaign to discredit IARC’s findings, attacking the scientists’ credibility and attempting to undermine the agency itself. Researchers who questioned glyphosate’s safety found themselves facing intense pressure, professional smears, and legal or political attacks designed to chill critical inquiry.

Meanwhile, scientific studies were building a troubling picture. Research linked glyphosate exposure to non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma in farmers and agricultural workers, aligning with the experiences of plaintiffs like Tralee Snape. Other studies documented widespread pesticide residues in food, indicating that glyphosate and other chemicals were not only a workplace hazard but a daily dietary exposure for the general population. Evidence also pointed to a decline in the nutritional quality of crops grown in pesticide‑intensive systems, raising concerns about the broader impacts of industrial agriculture on public health and food security.

As lawsuits multiplied and internal documents surfaced, Monsanto’s legal and financial liabilities surged. Yet instead of prompting a reckoning, this crisis was folded into a massive corporate reshuffling. Bayer, the German chemical and pharmaceutical giant, acquired Monsanto even as the wave of glyphosate‑related litigation and scientific controversy intensified. The merger did not erase the underlying issues: the glyphosate cancer cases, the accusations of falsified tests and ghostwritten science, and the documented bullying of scientists and agencies all remain central to the ongoing struggle over pesticide regulation and corporate accountability.

The Roundup story is not only about one product or one company. It is about how powerful agribusiness interests can distort science, endanger public health, and undermine trust in regulatory systems. The courage of farmers, workers, and communities who have brought these practices to light—often at great personal cost—continues to drive a global demand for transparency, justice, and a transition away from hazardous chemicals in our food and farming systems.
