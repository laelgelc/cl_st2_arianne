After three years of Greenpeace campaigning across Southeast Asia, the regional tuna industry is beginning to shift. Greenpeace’s latest tuna ranking now shows five companies achieving a Green rating for more sustainable practices. When this work began, there were almost no companies in the region that could make such a claim.

This progress matters because canned tuna is a staple in many Southeast Asian households, yet most consumers still know very little about where their tuna comes from or how it is caught. Behind every can are fishing practices that can either help protect our oceans or push them closer to collapse.

The report highlights serious threats facing tuna populations and marine ecosystems, especially in Indonesia and the Philippines. In these key fishing nations, unsustainable methods are still widely used, including the catching of juvenile tuna that have not yet had a chance to reproduce. Many of these young fish are caught with the help of fish aggregating devices (FADs), which attract large numbers of marine animals and can lead to high levels of bycatch and overfishing.

Another concern the report exposes is the double standard within the tuna industry. Companies often apply stricter sustainability rules to tuna destined for export markets, where buyers and regulators demand higher standards. Meanwhile, products sold in local markets are frequently subject to weaker safeguards, leaving local consumers with fewer sustainable choices and the oceans with less protection.

Greenpeace is calling on consumers in Southeast Asia to use their power to change this. By demanding tuna that is free from environmental and human rights abuses, shoppers can help push companies to apply strong sustainability standards across all their products, not just those sent overseas. Choosing and asking for responsibly sourced tuna also supports better traceability, so that every can can be tracked back through the supply chain.

The emergence of five Green-rated companies shows that progress is possible when people speak up. Continued consumer pressure is essential to protect tuna populations, safeguard ocean ecosystems, and ensure that all tuna—whether for export or local shelves—is caught responsibly and transparently.
