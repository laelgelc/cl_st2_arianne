In a year when much of the world came to a standstill, Greenpeace crews, volunteers, and scientists kept moving across oceans and into remote regions to document the escalating impacts of global warming and challenge the fossil fuel industry at its frontiers.

From the decks of the Rainbow Warrior, Arctic Sunrise, and Esperanza, activists captured images that tell a story of resistance and responsibility at the edge of a warming world. In the Southern Ocean, Antarctic petrels wheeled above cold, dark waters as industrial krill fishing pushed ever deeper into fragile ecosystems already stressed by rising temperatures. The presence of these birds near fishing operations underlined how closely the fate of wildlife is tied to human activity in a rapidly changing climate.

Far to the north, in the Arctic, youth leadership took center stage. Teen climate activist Mya-Rose Craig stood on the ice to hold what became the northernmost climate strike, a solitary but powerful action set against a backdrop of vanishing sea ice and disrupted weather patterns. Her strike symbolized the determination of a new generation to confront the climate crisis even in the planet’s most remote corners.

Closer to home for the oil industry, Greenpeace ships and activists confronted fossil fuel expansion in the North Sea. Protests targeted a Shell oil platform, challenging the company’s continued extraction plans in a region already heavily developed for oil and gas. At sea and in harbors, banners, boats, and determined crews sent a clear message: more drilling is incompatible with a safe climate.

In Sweden, a flotilla of small boats joined forces with a 62-hour blockade to oppose the expansion of the Preem oil refinery. Activists on the water and at the facility held their ground long enough to help tip the balance. Preem ultimately withdrew its plans to expand the refinery, a rare and significant retreat by a major fossil fuel player in the face of sustained public pressure.

Across the Skagerrak in Denmark, campaigners pushed for a different kind of future for the North Sea. Activists demanded a national ban on new oil and gas activities and called for a rapid expansion of wind power instead. Their actions highlighted a simple choice: continue drilling and burning, or harness the region’s powerful winds to drive a just transition away from fossil fuels.

In Germany, projections beamed across the sea’s surface and surrounding areas called attention to the urgent need for ocean protection. These visual messages underscored how rising temperatures, acidification, and industrial exploitation threaten marine life and coastal communities alike, and how safeguarding the seas is central to tackling the climate emergency.

The year’s images also captured moments of bold theatrical protest. In Denmark, activists prepared to occupy an oil rig, carrying the trident from Jason Momoa’s “Aquaman” as a striking symbol. The prop, repurposed in the real-world struggle for climate justice, connected popular culture with direct action, drawing attention to the absurdity of clinging to offshore oil in an age of escalating climate breakdown.

Threaded through all these scenes is the persistence of the people aboard the Rainbow Warrior, Arctic Sunrise, and Esperanza: ship crews navigating difficult conditions, volunteers taking risks on the water, and scientists gathering evidence in remote and vulnerable places. Even as a pandemic reshaped daily life across the globe, they continued to document the realities of global warming and confront the industries driving it, turning a year of isolation into a year of powerful witness on the frontlines of the climate crisis.
