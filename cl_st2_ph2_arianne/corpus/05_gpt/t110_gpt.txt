When the founder of a major outdoor brand pledged all company equity to fighting the climate crisis, it sent a powerful message: Earth must come before shareholders. In a world where business as usual is driving environmental breakdown, this decision stands out as a clear example of choosing people and planet over profit.

It is a reminder that we face a decisive moment. The climate and biodiversity crises are no longer distant warnings; they are visible in our daily lives. At the same time, more and more people across the world are questioning the economic system that helped create this emergency. Neo-liberal capitalism—built on endless growth, deregulation, and extraction—is being challenged, especially by young people who see how deeply it is tied to inequality and environmental destruction.

In response, the environmental movement is increasingly focused on root causes, not just symptoms. That means standing shoulder to shoulder with other activists and social movements, and recognizing that the fight for climate justice is inseparable from struggles for economic and social justice. It means confronting the structures that prioritize short-term profit over long-term planetary survival.

There are real, hopeful alternatives on the table. Debt cancellation for countries in the Global South can free up resources for climate action and social needs instead of servicing unjust debts. Progressive taxation can ensure that those with the greatest wealth and responsibility contribute fairly to the transition. Ending fossil fuel subsidies can stop public money from propping up the industries most responsible for the crisis. Moving beyond GDP as the main measure of progress can help us prioritize what truly matters: social well-being, healthy ecosystems, and a safe climate.

These ideas are not abstract. Around the world, communities are already putting them into practice in ways that build resilience and hope. People are organizing around cooperation instead of competition, drawing on indigenous knowledge and asserting sovereignty over their lands and resources. Purpose-driven companies are rethinking ownership and profit, showing that business can be redesigned to serve the public good and protect nature rather than exploit it.

The choice we face is stark but also full of possibility. We can cling to a failing status quo, or we can choose action, hope, and courage. A green and fair future—based on justice, collaboration, and care for the living world—is not only necessary, it is achievable. By putting people and planet before profit, and by transforming our economies to reflect that priority, we can build the resilient, just societies that this moment demands.
