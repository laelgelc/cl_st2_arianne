In front of Bangkok’s Government House, Indigenous Karen leaders Prasert Pukad, Gip Tonnampetch, and Phanomphon Wanakhunsiri stood to demand something very clear: recognition of their ancestral rights in Bang Kloi – Jai Paen Din, inside Kaeng Krachan National Park.

Their message challenges a narrative that treats them as outsiders or threats to the forest. Long before Kaeng Krachan was declared a national park in 1981, their community lived in and cared for these forests. They describe a way of life rooted in sustainable practices and spiritual connection to the land, not in extraction or destruction.

Central to their stewardship is traditional shifting cultivation, carried out with rituals that honor Mother Earth. This form of agriculture is not simply a technique; it is part of a cultural system that ties food, land, and spirit together. The Karen leaders emphasize that, through this relationship, their community has “guarded” the forest for generations, maintaining the ecosystems that others now seek to protect through top-down conservation policies.

Despite this history, they face evictions, abuses, and decisions made without their consent or meaningful consultation. Government actions have pushed them off their ancestral territories, undermining both their rights and their role as caretakers of the forest. The leaders denounce this treatment and make it clear they will continue to fight for self-determination in their homeland.

Their struggle is not only about land; it is about recognition, dignity, and the right to decide their own future in the place their ancestors have always called home. It is also a direct challenge to conservation models that exclude Indigenous peoples instead of recognizing them as rights-holders and partners.

Greenpeace Thailand stands with the Karen leaders in Bang Kloi – Jai Paen Din. By supporting their demands, Greenpeace underscores that Indigenous rights are not separate from environmental protection—they are essential to it. Respecting ancestral territories, traditional practices, and community self-determination is a crucial part of safeguarding forests and the life they sustain.
