Mr. Toru Anzai was 73 years old when the TEPCO nuclear disaster struck Fukushima in 2011. A resident of Iitate, he was forced to evacuate after the accident. The destruction he witnessed, and the sense of loss that followed, left him unable to even pick up his camera. Photography, something that had once been part of his life, felt impossible in the face of what had happened to his hometown.

That changed in 2012, when he met photojournalist Kikujiro Fukushima. This encounter became a turning point. Encouraged and inspired, Anzai began photographing again. He turned his lens toward the townscapes after the disaster, the evacuated areas, and the many forms of recovery efforts that were slowly taking shape around him.

Over time, he created a vast archive of about 40,000 photos and videos. Through these images, he documented the altered landscapes, the traces of absence, and the gradual, uneven steps toward rebuilding. His work did not remain private: he held exhibitions in Tokyo, Fukushima, and Yamaguchi, sharing what he had seen and recorded with people far beyond his own community.

In 2018, Anzai demolished his dilapidated home in Iitate. The house, damaged and left behind through years of displacement and uncertainty, could no longer be lived in. Bringing it down marked another difficult milestone in the long aftermath of the disaster.

Now living in Date, near the restricted zones, Anzai continues to document Fukushima’s “now.” From his new home, he keeps photographing the changing reality around the restricted areas and the ongoing challenges that remain. His aim is to preserve a record for future generations: a visual testimony that shows not only what was lost, but how people and places have carried on in the years since the nuclear accident.
