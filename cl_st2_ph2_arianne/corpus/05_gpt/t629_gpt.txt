On March 15, thousands of young people across the United States will walk out of their classrooms to demand urgent climate action. Among them is 16-year-old Minneapolis student Isra Hirsi, a co-leader of the US Youth Climate Strike, part of a global wave of youth protests inspired by Swedish activist Greta Thunberg. Strikes are planned in 47 countries and in nearly all 50 US states, signaling how deeply climate injustice is resonating with a new generation.

For Isra, climate activism is not a recent discovery. She has been involved in activism in some form since first grade, but high school was when it became central to her life. Through her school’s green team and the MN Can’t Wait coalition, she began organizing more seriously, connecting local environmental issues to broader systemic crises. Events like the Flint water crisis and the Line 3 pipeline fight helped sharpen her understanding of how climate and environmental harms fall hardest on marginalized communities.

The US Youth Climate Strike is explicitly youth-led, and young women of color are at its core. This leadership reflects who is already living with the consequences of environmental racism and climate disruption, and who is often left out of traditional decision-making spaces. The movement’s demands include urgent climate action at the scale of the crisis, such as policies like the Green New Deal, which seek to transform the economy while centering justice.

For many of the students striking, the decision to walk out is not taken lightly. It means stepping away from schoolwork, tests, and attendance requirements to insist that their futures are on the line. The organizing is intense and stressful—balancing homework, family life, and national coordination—but they see no other choice if they want real change.

These young organizers are asking adults to confront discomfort: to acknowledge the severity of the climate crisis, to listen to youth leadership, and to act at the speed science and justice demand. As students like Isra leave their classrooms on March 15, they are sending a clear message: there is no education on a dead planet, and their generation refuses to stay silent.
