Claims that current temperature rises are just typical Holocene fluctuations ignore what the evidence actually shows: human-driven carbon emissions have pushed global heating beyond the bounds of natural variability seen over the last 11,700 years.

During the Holocene, global temperatures and atmospheric CO₂ moved within relatively narrow ranges, shaped by slow, natural drivers such as orbital cycles, volcanic activity, and gradual changes in land and ice cover. Today’s changes are fundamentally different. Human activities—primarily the burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes—have introduced forcings that are larger than anything previously recorded in human history.

A central piece of evidence is the rapid surge in atmospheric CO₂. Concentrations have climbed to around 415 parts per million, far above typical Holocene levels. The rate of this increase is estimated to be 100–1000 times faster than Holocene averages. This pace is far beyond the slow, natural shifts that characterized earlier millennia and cannot be explained by natural cycles alone.

These human-driven forcings do not act in isolation. Positive feedbacks in the climate system are amplifying the heating. As temperatures rise, processes such as ice melt and changes in ecosystems can further reduce the planet’s ability to reflect heat or store carbon, reinforcing the initial warming. At the same time, humanity’s ecological overshoot—our overuse and degradation of ecosystems—has weakened Earth’s resilience. A less resilient biosphere is less able to buffer shocks, absorb emissions, or recover from disturbances, making the climate system more vulnerable to being pushed into new states.

There is also considerable inertia in the climate system. Even if emissions were sharply reduced today, the accumulated greenhouse gases and the slow response of oceans and ice sheets mean that temperatures and CO₂ levels are likely to continue rising for some time. This path dependence raises the risk of crossing thresholds that could trigger large-scale, potentially irreversible state shifts in the Earth system.

Taken together, these factors show that the current warming is not just another Holocene fluctuation. The combination of unprecedented human forcings, rapid CO₂ increases, amplifying feedbacks, and ecological overshoot is driving changes unlike those of any prior era, breaking through Holocene trend lines and pushing the planet into uncharted territory.
