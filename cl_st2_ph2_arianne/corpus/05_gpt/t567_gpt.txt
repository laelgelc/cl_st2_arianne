On 31 July, people in more than 25 cities across the world – from the Philippines to New Zealand – are taking action in public spaces to hold the oil industry accountable for its role in driving climate anxiety, climate breakdown, disasters, and emergencies. Some are doing this in direct response to harm they are experiencing, while others are acting in solidarity with communities already on the frontlines of climate impacts.

Across these cities, posters are appearing in streets, stations, and other public places. They show generic but recognisable images of predicted climate impacts: severe forest fires tearing through landscapes, extreme rainfall overwhelming communities, hurricanes growing more intense, and extreme temperatures becoming more frequent. Alongside these images, the posters highlight data on oil’s destructive footprint, including the staggering figure of 10,000 oil tanker spills recorded in 2018. Rather than singling out individual companies, they point to the oil industry as a whole, making clear that this is a systemic problem.

The message on these posters links the industry’s historic pollution to the climate crisis we are living through today. They draw a line from decades of oil extraction, burning, and spills to the worsening extreme weather people are experiencing around the world. At the same time, they call out the industry’s ongoing lobbying against effective climate policy, showing how oil companies are not only responsible for past and present damage, but are actively working to slow or block the solutions needed to protect people and the planet.

This global mobilisation is rooted in widely available scientific resources that document how fossil fuels are driving more dangerous weather. Participants are sharing tools like the Carbon Brief map, which visualises climate impacts and links them to human-driven warming. They are circulating videos that explain how hurricanes are becoming wetter and more destructive, and how extreme heatwaves are intensifying in a warming world. They are also drawing on findings from BAMS (Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society) reports, which assess the role of human-induced climate change in specific extreme events.

Together, these public actions and shared resources send a clear, unified signal: the worsening fires, floods, storms, and heatwaves are not random disasters. They are part of a pattern that is deeply connected to the oil industry’s pollution and political obstruction. Around the world, people are using their streets and public spaces to demand that this must end – and that the era of oil must come to a close.
