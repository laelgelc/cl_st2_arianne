On the steep hills of Daraitan in Rizal, the Dumagat Remontado people tend to their taro and purple yam, crops that have sustained their community for generations. Farming here is not just a way to fill cooking pots; it is a tradition passed from elders to the young, rooted in the land that holds their stories, rituals, and identity.

These hilltop farms are more than fields. They are part of the Dumagat Remontado’s sacred landscape—places where knowledge about planting seasons, soil, and water is shared in everyday work. Each harvest is a continuation of a relationship with the land that has shaped the community’s way of life.

In recent years, this way of life has come under severe strain. The COVID-19 pandemic made it harder for the community to sustain themselves, limiting mobility and access to basic needs. At the same time, they have been opposing the Kaliwa Dam project, which threatens to submerge their farms and sacred grounds. For the Dumagat Remontado, the prospect of losing these places is not just an economic concern; it strikes at the heart of their cultural survival.

Their vulnerability was made even more evident when Typhoon Vamco brought heavy rains and flooding. As waters rose, the community turned to ancestral guidance. Visions from their elders and ancestors helped them decide when and where to evacuate, shaping their response to the storm. In this moment of danger, traditional knowledge became a lifeline.

Despite these overlapping crises—the pandemic, the looming threat of the dam, and the devastation of the typhoon—the Dumagat Remontado chose to respond to others’ hardship with generosity. As community pantries began appearing across Metro Manila during lockdowns, offering free food to anyone in need, the call for contributions reached their hills.

From their own harvests, they donated vegetables to these pantries. Taro, purple yam, and other produce traveled from their remote farms to urban neighborhoods where many were struggling to eat. In the middle of fear and uncertainty, this act of sharing helped nourish families far from Daraitan.

The exchange did more than fill empty kitchens. It created a bridge of solidarity between indigenous farmers and city residents. The spirit of bayanihan—people coming together to help one another—flowed in both directions: urban communities recognized the generosity and struggle of the Dumagat Remontado, while the farmers saw their harvests become part of a wider movement of mutual aid.

In giving what they could, even while facing threats to their land and lives, the Dumagat Remontado showed how deeply their values are tied to care, reciprocity, and community. Their story is one of resilience: holding onto ancestral visions, defending their sacred places, and extending their harvests to others in need.
