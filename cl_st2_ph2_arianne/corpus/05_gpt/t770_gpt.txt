Seven years after the Fukushima nuclear accident, the pain and uncertainty for many affected communities is far from over. Marking this anniversary is not just about remembering a disaster in the past; it is about recognising the ongoing reality for people still living with contamination, displacement and difficult choices about their futures.

In areas like Namie and Obori, radiation remains a serious concern. Greenpeace surveys have found hot spots where radiation levels are still high enough that people could reach what is considered an annual exposure limit in a matter of days. Despite this, the Japanese government plans to reopen these zones by 2023. These decisions are being made even though high levels of contamination are expected to persist for decades, raising profound questions about safety, justice and the rights of those who once called these places home.

For evacuees, the statistics translate into deeply personal stories. Mrs. Mizue Kanno is one of many who were forced to leave their homes in the wake of the Fukushima accident. Her life was uprooted, and like countless others, she has had to navigate the loss of her community, livelihood and sense of security. Rather than accept this as an unavoidable consequence, she has become an activist against nuclear power, joining lawsuits against TEPCO and the Japanese government. Her decision to stand up in court reflects a broader struggle to hold those responsible to account and to ensure that the voices of evacuees are not sidelined as policies are made about their future.

Greenpeace’s survey report on radiation in places like Namie and Obori underlines the need for continued precautions. It challenges the idea that reopening contaminated areas is simply a technical or economic decision, and instead highlights the human rights implications for people being encouraged—or pressured—to return. The push to declare these areas “safe” is closely linked to a wider political goal: facilitating the restart of nuclear reactors across Japan. The reopening of evacuation zones is being used to signal that the nuclear crisis is “over,” even as contamination remains and communities are still divided and dispersed.

The coming months and years will be critical. Upcoming UN sessions and court rulings offer important opportunities to insist that human rights are at the centre of decisions about Fukushima’s aftermath. These processes can help reinforce the obligations of governments and corporations to protect people from harm, respect the choices of evacuees, and provide real support rather than simply cutting compensation or lifting evacuation orders.

At the same time, they are a chance to push for a different kind of energy future—one that does not rely on risky nuclear power, but instead promotes renewable energy and energy efficiency. The experience of Fukushima continues to show why a transition to safer, sustainable energy systems is not just an environmental necessity, but a matter of justice for those who have already paid too high a price.
