Two hundred Brazilian civil society organizations, among them Greenpeace Brazil, have come together to send a clear message to the United States government: do not support President Jair Bolsonaro’s destructive environmental agenda through secretive negotiations.

The organizations’ letter focuses on ongoing talks that involve the possibility of billions of dollars in US funding, supposedly to help curb deforestation in the Amazon. According to the signatories, these negotiations are happening behind closed doors and risk reinforcing the very policies that are driving the destruction of the forest and the violation of rights.

The letter highlights that under Bolsonaro, Brazil’s climate commitments have been weakened to levels below what the country pledged under the Paris Agreement. At the same time, deforestation has increased, Indigenous Peoples have been harmed, and existing mechanisms designed to protect the forest—such as the Amazon Fund—have not been properly used by the current administration.

The organizations warn that any deal struck under these conditions would do more than simply fail to protect the Amazon. It would legitimize a government that has actively dismantled environmental protections and would likely channel resources to large landowners rather than to communities and initiatives that actually defend the forest and its peoples.

For the Brazilian groups, this is not only a national concern but also an international one. They argue that supporting Bolsonaro’s environmental policies through these opaque negotiations would undermine the climate leadership that the Biden administration has promised to exercise. Instead of backing a government that has rolled back protections, they urge the US to align its actions with its climate commitments and stand with those in Brazil who are working to safeguard the Amazon and the rights of Indigenous Peoples.
