The latest IPCC Working Group III Report makes one thing unmistakably clear: we still have a chance to limit global heating to 1.5°C, but only if we act with unprecedented speed and scale. The report lays out a path to nearly halve global emissions by 2030, and it shows that many of the solutions already exist, are proven, and in many cases are low-cost or even save money.

Central to this path is a rapid expansion of renewable energy. Solar and wind power are highlighted as key technologies that can dramatically cut emissions from the power sector. Alongside this, conserving and restoring forests is essential, both to store carbon and to protect biodiversity and communities that rely on healthy ecosystems.

The report also stresses the importance of more efficient and sustainable agriculture, as well as major improvements in energy efficiency across all sectors. Using energy more wisely—from buildings to industry to transport—can deliver large emission reductions while often reducing costs for households and businesses.

Climate governance is changing too. The report notes the rise of climate litigation as an increasingly important force. Around the world, people and communities are turning to the courts to hold governments and corporations to account for their climate commitments and failures, adding new pressure for real change.

However, the scale of transformation required is far beyond what current policies deliver. The report is clear that investments in climate solutions must at least triple, while subsidies and financial support for fossil fuels must end. Continuing to pour public money into coal, oil and gas undermines the very solutions we need to scale up.

Equity is at the heart of the IPCC’s findings. High emitters—whether countries, companies, or individuals—must do more and move faster. The report underlines that climate action must be fair, with just transitions that protect workers and communities as fossil fuels are phased out and cleaner systems are built.

Despite decades of warnings, no country is currently on track to deliver the emission cuts required to keep 1.5°C within reach. This gap between what is needed and what is happening can only be closed through transformative changes driven by strong policies, rapid innovation, and sustained public pressure.

The message is stark but hopeful: we have the tools to phase out fossil fuels, build cleaner and fairer economies, and secure a livable future. Whether this happens in time depends on decisions made now—by governments, businesses, and all of us demanding and driving the just transitions the science says are still possible.
