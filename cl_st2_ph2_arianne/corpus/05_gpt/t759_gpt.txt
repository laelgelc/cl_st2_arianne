The shipping industry is one of the world’s biggest climate polluters, yet it has managed to avoid the kind of strict regulation applied to many other sectors. For years, powerful industry lobbying and a lack of public scrutiny have allowed ships to continue burning some of the dirtiest fuels on the planet, largely out of sight and out of mind. That has to change.

Right now, governments have a crucial opportunity to turn things around. In April, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) is meeting in London to decide how – and how fast – the sector will cut its climate‑heating emissions. This meeting is a key moment: countries can choose to adopt a high‑ambition plan that puts global shipping on a path to phasing out its emissions entirely by 2050.

Greenpeace is working with other NGOs to push governments at the IMO to seize this chance. There are deep divisions among IMO member states. Some are resisting strong climate rules, while others are calling for measures that match what science and the Paris Agreement demand. But the solutions needed to cut shipping emissions already exist, and they can be scaled up if governments send a clear signal.

Ships can slow down, immediately cutting fuel use and emissions. Carbon‑free fuels can replace the fossil fuels currently burned at sea. Wind‑assisted propulsion technologies can help power vessels, reducing their reliance on polluting fuels. These are not distant ideas; they are real tools that can help drive down emissions from a sector that currently pollutes as much as a major emitting country.

Shipping’s climate impact is enormous – on the scale of one of the world’s top emitters – and ignoring it makes it impossible to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement. If the IMO fails to act with the urgency required, the rest of the world will be forced to work even harder to compensate for the sector’s unchecked pollution.

Public pressure is vital to counterbalance industry lobbying and push governments toward a high‑ambition outcome in London. You can help by sharing the campaign Facebook page calling for cleaner shipping and a 2050 phase‑out of emissions. Every share helps shine a spotlight on a sector that has stayed in the shadows for too long and sends a clear message to decision‑makers: the world is watching, and we expect shipping to do its fair share in tackling the climate crisis.
