The air is thick with smoke long before the hospital comes into view.

In Palangkaraya, Central Kalimantan, the Doris Sylvanus Hospital has created what people now call the “Oxygen House” – a place where families bring their loved ones, often their youngest children, to fight for every breath in the middle of Indonesia’s forest fire crisis. 

Greenpeace photographer Jurnasyanto Sukarno walks into this space carrying his camera, but what confronts him is not just a scene to be documented. It is a raw, unfolding emergency.

Among the patients is a 50-day-old baby named Rafa. His parents have brought him in because he is struggling to breathe in the toxic smoke that blankets their community. The fires, driven by the clearing of peatlands for palm oil plantations, have turned the air into a constant threat. For Rafa, every inhalation is a battle.

In the Oxygen House, the infant receives oxygen and steam therapy. Medical staff work to ease his breathing, while his family stands by, visibly distressed. The room holds the sound of machines, quiet instructions, and the muted cries of children who are too young to understand why their chests feel so tight, their throats so raw.

Sukarno watches as this tiny child fights the invisible pollution that seeps into every corner of daily life. His photographs capture not only the medical equipment and the haze outside the windows, but also the fear and exhaustion etched into the faces of parents who have no choice but to keep returning to the hospital.

He reflects on how many children he sees without protective masks, exposed to the smoke day after day. Families come back again and again seeking relief, trapped in a cycle of illness and treatment while the fires continue to burn.

What he is witnessing is part of a broader catastrophe. The forest fire crisis in Indonesia, driven by the clearing of peatlands for palm oil, has reached what he describes as the worst level since 2015. Yet, despite the scale of the disaster and the human suffering he documents, there has been no revocation of palm oil licenses and no sanctions on the companies responsible.

Inside the Oxygen House, the consequences of those decisions are immediate and painfully clear. A baby gasps for clean air, a family waits in anguish, and a photographer bears witness to a crisis that shows no sign of ending.
