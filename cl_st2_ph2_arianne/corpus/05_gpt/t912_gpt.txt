The Arctic is one of the most remote places on Earth, yet today it stands at the center of a global struggle. To make its beauty and fragility visible far beyond the ice, an International Poster Contest for the Arctic has brought together a powerful wave of creativity from around the world.

More than 2000 posters have been submitted from over 40 countries, all focused on one shared goal: raising awareness of the industrial threats facing the Arctic, such as oil activities and destructive fishing, and celebrating the extraordinary diversity of species that call this region home. Each poster is a visual call to action, urging politicians to move beyond words and take real steps to protect the Arctic.

The contest is not just about art; it’s about impact. Three winning artists will be invited to join Greenpeace in Svalbard, bringing their vision directly to the Arctic itself. Their work will stand as a reminder that what happens in this remote region affects us all.

The creative energy of the contest has also spilled into the streets. In Barcelona, an Urban Art Festival turned 600 meters of walls into a vast Arctic canvas. Over the course of the event, 35 artists from 8 countries painted their own interpretations of the Arctic: its wildlife, its icy landscapes, and the threats looming over it. Passersby were confronted with powerful images that transformed a city space into a public gallery for the polar world.

As Albert Einstein once said, “Creativity is contagious, pass it on.” That spirit runs through every poster and every painted wall in this movement for the Arctic. The contest is open until April 30, giving more artists the chance to add their voices and visions to this global effort to protect one of the planet’s most vital and vulnerable regions.
