I was meant to be walking my dog in Scotland, not staring up at a towering oil rig in the North Sea.

When I left London, I thought I was heading north for a bit of fresh air and a change of scenery. Instead, I found myself boarding the Greenpeace ship Arctic Sunrise and sailing straight into the middle of a stand-off with one of the world’s biggest oil companies.

For the past ten days, activists have been occupying a BP oil rig in the Cromarty Firth. Each time it tried to leave and head out to drill, they forced it to turn back. Again and again, the rig has been pushed off course, unable to reach its destination.

This isn’t just any piece of machinery. It’s BP’s only new rig this year, and it’s been commissioned to extract 30 million barrels of oil at a time when the climate crisis is already unfolding around us. Every barrel burned takes us further away from the safe, liveable future that people all over the world are fighting for.

From the deck of the Arctic Sunrise, watching this play out has been surreal and inspiring in equal measure. The determination of the team occupying the rig, and the crew supporting them, has been unshakeable. Ten days is a long time to hold your nerve in the shadow of a structure built for the sole purpose of pulling more fossil fuels out of the ground.

I feel incredibly proud of everyone involved in this action. Their persistence has already had a tangible impact: BP’s rig is still not drilling. Each forced U-turn is a reminder that the company’s plans are not inevitable, and that people are willing to put themselves on the line to challenge them.

My hope is that this moment becomes a turning point. That by blocking this single rig, we help push BP to reconsider its plans to keep searching for and extracting more oil. In the middle of a climate emergency, that’s the direction every fossil fuel company needs to move in.

I didn’t plan to end up here. But standing on this ship, watching a rig full of untapped oil held in place by courage and conviction, I know there’s nowhere else I’d rather be.
