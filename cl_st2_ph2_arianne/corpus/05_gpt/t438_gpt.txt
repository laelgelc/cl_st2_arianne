The COVID-19 pandemic has shown how deeply human health is tied to the health of the natural world. As forests are cleared, ecosystems are destroyed, and wildlife is captured and traded, the protective barriers between humans and other species are broken down. This increases the chances that viruses and other pathogens will jump from animals to people, driving up the risk of new infectious diseases.

Biodiversity loss is at the heart of this problem. When complex ecosystems are degraded, species that help regulate disease can decline or disappear, while others that carry or transmit pathogens may thrive. Deforestation and habitat destruction push wildlife into closer contact with human communities and livestock, creating more opportunities for zoonotic diseases to emerge. The global spread of COVID-19 is a stark reminder that what happens in one part of the world can rapidly affect everyone, everywhere.

Because ecosystems and diseases do not respect national borders, the solutions cannot stop at borders either. Safeguarding biodiversity and reducing the risk of future pandemics demands coordinated, international action. One of the key proposals in this effort is the Convention on Biological Diversity’s “protect 30” goal: to protect at least 30% of the world’s land and oceans by 2030 through effective sanctuaries and conservation areas.

These protected areas are meant to serve as safe havens for wildlife and intact ecosystems, reducing destructive activities that drive biodiversity loss and increase disease risks. But simply drawing lines on a map is not enough. The success of “protect 30” depends on how protections are put into practice and who is involved in shaping and managing them.

Respecting the rights of Indigenous Peoples is essential. Indigenous communities have long-standing relationships with their territories and play a crucial role in safeguarding biodiversity. Any conservation measure must recognize their land rights, knowledge, and leadership, rather than displacing or marginalizing them.

Women’s empowerment is equally important. Women are often central to community resource management, food systems, and caregiving. Ensuring that women have a voice in decisions, access to resources, and leadership opportunities strengthens both biodiversity protection and community resilience to health threats.

Community engagement more broadly is a cornerstone of effective conservation. Local communities living in and around biodiverse areas are on the front lines of both environmental change and disease risk. Their participation in designing, implementing, and monitoring protections is vital to making “protect 30” work in practice and to ensuring that measures are fair and sustainable.

International support is also critical. Frontline communities, including Indigenous Peoples and local residents in biodiverse regions, often bear the greatest responsibility for protecting ecosystems while having the fewest resources. Financial assistance, technical support, and fair partnerships are needed so they can implement protections, maintain livelihoods, and respond to health and environmental challenges.

By linking biodiversity protection with human health, the “protect 30” proposal highlights a path toward reducing the risk of future pandemics while safeguarding the living systems on which we all depend. Protecting at least 30% of land and oceans by 2030, grounded in Indigenous rights, women’s empowerment, strong community participation, and robust international support, is a global step toward a safer, healthier, and more resilient future.
