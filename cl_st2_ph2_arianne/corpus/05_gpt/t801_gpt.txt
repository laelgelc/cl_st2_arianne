Thanks to years of tireless campaigning, governments have now agreed to protect a vast area of the Arctic Ocean from commercial fishing for at least the next 16 years. This newly protected zone is roughly the size of the Mediterranean Sea. It is a major step forward, driven by the Save the Arctic campaign, and it strengthens global efforts to secure long-term safeguards against destructive fishing and fossil fuel exploitation in one of the most fragile regions on Earth.

At the other end of the planet, another historic victory is taking effect. The Ross Sea sanctuary in the Antarctic, an area twice the size of Spain, officially comes into force today. This means the Ross Sea will be shielded from extractive industries, creating a critical refuge for polar wildlife and a living laboratory for understanding a rapidly changing climate.

These twin wins in the Arctic and Antarctic are victories for penguins, whales, seals, and the tiny but vital krill that underpin polar ecosystems. They are also victories for the global oceans as a whole. Protecting these remote waters helps safeguard biodiversity, maintain healthier marine food webs, and build resilience against the growing impacts of climate breakdown.

Most importantly, these achievements show what people power can do. Public pressure, mobilisations, and persistent campaigning have pushed governments to act where for years there was only delay and denial. The protections now in place are the direct result of millions of voices demanding that the world’s last wild oceans be defended from industrial exploitation.

Drawing inspiration from the protections first won for Antarctica in the 1980s, the next step is clear. The world must come together to create a massive Antarctic Ocean Sanctuary that can fully protect penguins, whales, seals, and krill from the relentless advance of industrial fishing. Building on today’s victories, this sanctuary would be a bold commitment to leaving fossil fuels and destructive industries out of the most pristine waters on the planet—and to putting the health of our shared oceans, and all life that depends on them, first.
