In Russia’s Arctic, a series of environmental crises is unfolding that exposes how fragile these ecosystems are – and how dangerous it is when powerful polluters operate behind closed doors.

A massive diesel spill in the Arctic has poured fuel into rivers and wetlands, with satellite images showing unnaturally colored waterways spreading toward the Arctic Ocean. These waters are part of a vast, interconnected system that supports unique wildlife and Indigenous communities, and any contamination here risks travelling far beyond the immediate spill zone.

At the same time, the Arctic is heating much faster than the rest of the planet because of the relentless burning of fossil fuels. This climate-driven warming is already transforming northern landscapes, thawing permafrost and creating the conditions for more frequent and more intense disasters. In Siberia, wildfires are growing in scale and severity, feeding back into the climate crisis by releasing even more carbon and destroying forests that help regulate the global climate.

In the region affected by the diesel spill, Norilsk Nickel effectively controls the territory. This corporate control has translated into tight restrictions on access and information. Independent experts, environmental groups and local communities have faced obstacles in trying to understand the true scale of the damage. Pollution data that should be public has been blocked, and the company’s grip on infrastructure has made it harder to carry out impartial investigations.

Despite these barriers, Greenpeace and journalists travelled to the affected area to collect samples from the diesel spill itself and from a separate incident involving wastewater dumping at the Talnakh factory. These samples are crucial for determining what pollutants are present, how far they have spread and what risks they pose to people and nature. Yet even this basic work has been obstructed. At the company-owned airport, authorities seized or blocked the samples, preventing them from being independently analyzed.

This pattern of secrecy and control leaves the public, scientists and affected communities in the dark. When independent monitoring is hindered and pollution data is hidden, it becomes impossible to fully understand the damage, hold polluters to account or design effective clean-up and prevention measures. It also undermines the global effort to confront the climate crisis, because the Arctic is a key region where climate impacts are already visible and escalating.

These events highlight an urgent need for transparency. Environmental disasters linked to fossil fuel production and use cannot be treated as internal corporate matters. Full, open access to information, independent sampling and monitoring, and unhindered reporting by journalists and civil society are essential. Only with transparency can societies respond adequately to pollution, protect vulnerable ecosystems like the Arctic and tackle the accelerating climate crisis driven by fossil fuels.
