I remember the first time I saw it: Shell’s “red monster” looming out of the grey North Sea, an enormous floating production, storage and offloading unit – an FPSO – on its way to the Penguins oil field.

I was on the deck of the Arctic Sunrise, my first time aboard a Greenpeace ship, and my first sea action. The waves were rough, the air was cold, and I was seasick enough to feel every movement of the ship deep in my bones. Beneath the nausea and the nerves, though, there was something stronger: a mix of anger, fear, and a stubborn kind of hope.

I was scared, of course. Being out at sea, confronting a symbol of the fossil fuel industry’s power, is not something you take lightly. The scale of that bright red structure made it feel almost unreal, like a monster out of place in the ocean. But this “red monster” is very real, and so are the consequences of what it represents: more oil, more emissions, more climate chaos.

My anger came from knowing that this is not an accident or an inevitability. Fossil fuel companies like Shell keep pushing for new extraction, and governments keep allowing it, even as the science is clear and the impacts are already here. Where I come from, in Cameroon, climate disasters are not abstract scenarios in a report. They are floods, droughts, and storms that destroy homes and livelihoods. They are losses that could have been prevented if those with power had chosen people and planet over profit.

Standing there, watching that FPSO move toward yet another oil field in the North Sea, I thought of communities back home and across the Global South paying the price for decisions made in boardrooms and parliaments far away. I thought about how many of those disasters could have been averted if we had acted faster, if fossil fuel expansion had been stopped, if justice had been taken seriously. That knowledge is heavy. It makes you angry because you can see how avoidable so much of this suffering is.

I was also thinking about the future – about children growing up in a world shaped by choices being made right now. The climate crisis is not just about rising temperatures; it’s about what kind of life will be possible for the next generations. Will they inherit oceans full of rigs and pipelines, or seas recovering and thriving? Will they grow up in communities constantly rebuilding after climate disasters, or in places made safer and fairer through a just transition?

Out on the Arctic Sunrise, my body was rebelling against the motion of the waves, but my mind kept going back to the bigger picture: this action was one small part of a much larger fight. Even as I clung to railings and tried to steady myself, I felt a kind of elation knowing we were not alone.

All over the world, people are resisting the fossil fuel status quo. Communities on the frontlines are organising to protect their land and water. Women are leading movements, often at great personal risk, to defend their homes and demand justice. Young people are taking to the streets, the courts, and international forums, refusing to accept that their future can be traded for short-term profit.

Their demands are clear: an end to fossil fuels. Real accountability for the loss and damage already being suffered. A just transition to clean energy that doesn’t leave workers or vulnerable communities behind.

Being part of a Greenpeace action against Shell’s “red monster” made those demands feel even more urgent, but also more tangible. As the ship moved through the choppy water, I could feel the connection between that moment in the North Sea and the struggles happening in so many other places. From the Arctic to the tropics, from coastal villages to big cities, people are standing up to say that this destructive system cannot continue.

That sense of global resistance is what stayed with me most strongly after my first sea action. Yes, I was scared. Yes, I was seasick. Yes, I was furious at the greed and the political cowardice that keep bringing us to the brink. But I was also deeply moved by the courage and determination I could feel around me – on the ship, in the communities I was thinking about, and in the countless movements pushing for change.

The red monster heading to the Penguins field is a symbol of everything we need to leave behind. The Arctic Sunrise, and the people and communities standing up around the world, are a reminder of what we can still choose instead: justice, accountability, and a rapid shift to clean, renewable energy.

Out there in the rough waters of the North Sea, between fear and hope, one thing felt absolutely certain to me: the fight to end the fossil fuel era is not only necessary, it is already well underway – and it is powered by people who refuse to give up on a livable, just future.
