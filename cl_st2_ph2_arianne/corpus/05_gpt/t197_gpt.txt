The erosion of our planet is not just a story of melting ice caps, burning forests, and polluted air. It is also a story of undervalued care, invisible labor, and economic systems that extract more than they replenish. At the heart of efforts to confront this crisis are feminist leaders from the global South and Indigenous communities who insist that the way forward must begin with recognizing the interconnectedness of all life.

These leaders are calling for a profound economic transformation that puts care work and social reproduction at the center. For generations, women have sustained families, communities, and ecosystems through unpaid and underpaid labor—growing food, fetching water, caring for children and elders, maintaining community ties, and defending land and territories. Their contributions have been systematically overlooked, even though they are essential to resilience and survival in the face of climate breakdown and social injustice.

To confront planetary erosion, these voices argue, we must move away from extractive economies that treat people and nature as resources to be exploited. Instead, they advocate for reparative economies that prioritize healing, regeneration, and long-term wellbeing for all forms of life. This means recognizing and valuing the invisible work that holds societies together, and designing policies and institutions that support, rather than undermine, that labor.

Ending austerity is a key demand. Austerity policies often strip away public services and social protections, deepening inequality and placing even more burden on those already doing the bulk of unpaid care. Feminist and Indigenous advocates insist that public investment in care, health, education, and social protection is not a luxury; it is the foundation of any just and sustainable economy. Reforming tax systems and debt structures is equally crucial so that resources flow toward collective wellbeing and ecological repair rather than toward profit and accumulation for a few.

Indigenous leaders further remind us that nature is not a distant resource but our home. Their solutions, grounded in long-held practices and worldviews, emphasize commons, shared stewardship, and limits to growth. Approaches like commons-based governance and degrowth challenge the idea that endless economic expansion is either possible or desirable. Instead, they focus on living well within ecological boundaries, honoring reciprocity, and caring for the land, waters, and all beings.

Across these perspectives, a common thread emerges: the crises we face—climate, inequality, biodiversity loss, social fragmentation—are deeply interconnected. They cannot be solved in isolation or through narrow technical fixes. Interconnected problems demand interconnected solutions that are rooted in care, respect, and mutual responsibility.

Centering care means recognizing that the health of economies depends on the health of people and ecosystems. It means ensuring that those who have long shouldered the work of sustaining life—especially women, communities in the global South, and Indigenous peoples—are not only protected but listened to and supported. It means shifting from systems that erode our shared home to systems that repair and regenerate it.

By valuing invisible contributions, transforming economic rules, ending harmful austerity, reforming taxes and debt, and embracing Indigenous practices like commons and degrowth, a different future becomes imaginable: one where resilience is built through relationships of care, and where the interconnectedness of all things is not an abstract idea but the guiding principle for how we live on this planet together.
