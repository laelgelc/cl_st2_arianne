Plastic pollution has long been recognized as a threat to marine life, ecosystems, and human health. What is now becoming clearer is that it is also directly linked to climate change in a way that has not been fully accounted for.

Sarah-Jeanne Royer, a French-Canadian postdoctoral scholar at the University of Hawaii's School of Ocean and Earth Science & Technology, has reported that decomposing plastic itself produces greenhouse gases. This represents a new source of climate-warming emissions that has not been included in prior climate models. As plastic production and accumulation continue to grow, these emissions are projected to rise as well.

These gases contribute to well-known climate change impacts, including sea level rise, higher global temperatures, ecosystem damage, and more extreme weather events. In other words, plastic pollution is not only choking our oceans and landscapes; it is also quietly heating the planet.

Royer’s work highlights that not all plastics behave the same way. Low-density polyethylene—one of the most common plastics used in single-use items—emits the most greenhouse gases as it breaks down. This is especially troubling given how widespread this material is in everyday packaging and disposable products.

Conditions in the environment also influence how much gas is released. When plastic degrades in the ocean, the emissions can increase dramatically—up to 488 times higher than what is released from raw plastic pellets. On land, the problem can be even worse: exposure to sunlight drives still higher releases of these gases as the material breaks apart.

These findings add another urgent reason to tackle plastic at its source. Because the emissions come from the breakdown of the material itself, downstream solutions like recycling or cleanup cannot fully solve the problem if production keeps rising. To effectively address this emerging climate threat, plastic production must be halted at the source.
