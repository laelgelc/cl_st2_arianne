Across Thailand, women are leading powerful movements for environmental justice, climate action, and community rights. Their work spans courtrooms, coastlines, classrooms, indigenous territories, and online spaces, but they are united by a shared determination: to protect people and the planet.

Supaporn Malailoy stands at the forefront of the struggle for environmental human rights, insisting that clean air and water are not privileges but basic rights that must be protected. Her advocacy highlights how environmental destruction directly harms people’s health, livelihoods, and dignity. By centering human rights in environmental work, she helps ensure that communities most affected by pollution and ecological damage are not left out of decision-making.

For years, Panita Pook Kongsook has given her time and energy as a Greenpeace volunteer, promoting non-violent action as a powerful tool for change. Her commitment shows how ordinary people can become extraordinary forces for justice when they organize, take to the streets, and raise their voices peacefully. Through her example, she encourages others to see that activism is not just for experts or leaders—everyone can play a part.

In Prachuap Khiri Khan, Sureerat Taechutrakul helped her community stand up to coal power. By working to stop coal plants from taking root in the province, she contributed to protecting local health, livelihoods, and ecosystems. Her efforts demonstrate how determined local resistance can challenge polluting projects and defend communities from long-term harm.

Nanticha “Lynn” Ocharoenchai represents a new generation of climate leadership. As the founder of Climate Strike Thailand, she has helped build a platform to pressure the government on climate issues and demand stronger action. By mobilizing people to take part in climate strikes, she underscores that the climate crisis is not a distant threat but an urgent reality requiring bold, immediate responses from those in power.

From an indigenous community on the frontlines of extractive industries, Pornchita Fapratanprai is opposing coal mining that threatens her people’s land and way of life. Her resistance embodies the deep connection between indigenous rights and environmental protection. By saying no to coal, she is defending not only a local landscape but also cultural survival and community self-determination.

Online, Gig Koranis Tanangsnakool is using research and social media to tackle one of the most pervasive forms of pollution: single-use plastics. By studying alternatives and sharing her findings widely, she helps people see that everyday choices matter—and that better options exist. Her work shows how digital platforms can amplify solutions and inspire practical changes in behavior.

These six women—Supaporn, Panita, Sureerat, Lynn, Pornchita, and Gig—are reshaping social, political, and economic conversations in Thailand. They are proving that environmental protection is inseparable from human rights, community power, indigenous sovereignty, youth leadership, and sustainable living.

Their courage and passion light the way toward a future where communities can breathe clean air, drink safe water, protect their lands, and live free from the harms of fossil fuels and plastic pollution. By standing up for their homes and the environment, they remind us that meaningful change often begins with people who refuse to accept injustice—and who choose, instead, to act.
