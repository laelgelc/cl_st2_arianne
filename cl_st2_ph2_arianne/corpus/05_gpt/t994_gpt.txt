Dorothy Stowe’s life was a quiet revolution. A Quaker, a social worker, and a relentless advocate for peace and justice, she helped plant the seeds of what would become Greenpeace. Her work began long before the organization had a name or a logo, rooted instead in a simple conviction: that ordinary people, acting together, could confront the most powerful forces on Earth.

Remembering Dorothy is a way of remembering how Greenpeace itself began—around kitchen tables, in small community meetings, and through the persistence of people who refused to accept war, nuclear testing, or environmental destruction as inevitable. She was a co-founder who helped shape the moral compass of the organization, insisting that peace and care for the planet were inseparable. Honoring her is also a way of honoring the many women whose courage, strategy, and creativity built Greenpeace from the ground up.

From the very beginning, women were at the heart of Greenpeace’s boldest ideas. It was Marie Bohlen who proposed what would become a defining tactic: sailing directly into the danger zone to protest U.S. nuclear tests. Her vision turned outrage into action. Rather than simply condemning nuclear testing from afar, she imagined a small boat placing human lives in the path of the blasts, forcing the world to look, listen, and respond. That simple but radical idea—bearing witness at sea—helped define Greenpeace’s identity and inspired countless actions that followed.

If Marie Bohlen helped launch the idea of sailing into nuclear test zones, Dorothy Metcalfe helped ensure the world heard about it. She managed media and lobbied governments, turning isolated acts of courage into global stories. Her work behind the scenes was as essential as any act of confrontation on the water. By building relationships with journalists, crafting messages, and pushing governments to respond, she helped transform Greenpeace from a small group of activists into a movement that could not be ignored.

On the waves themselves, women were often on the front lines. Linda Spong and Bobbi Hunter played key roles in the early whale campaigns and blockades, placing their bodies between whaling ships and the whales they were trying to save. Their presence on those small boats, facing down massive industrial vessels, showed the world that the fight to protect marine life was not abstract—it was immediate, personal, and deeply human. These actions helped expose the brutality of whaling and galvanized public support for change.

The story of the Rainbow Warrior, one of Greenpeace’s most iconic ships, is also a story of women’s determination and ingenuity. Susi Newborn and Denise Bell were central to acquiring and outfitting the vessel, transforming it from a ship into a symbol. Their work made it possible for the Rainbow Warrior to become a moving platform for environmental action, from anti-whaling efforts to nuclear protests. Every plank refitted, every piece of equipment installed, was part of building the capacity to confront environmental injustice on the high seas.

When Greenpeace took its campaign against nuclear testing to French test sites, women were again there to document the risks and the violence. Ann-Marie Horne and Mary Lornie played crucial roles in recording French assaults during these protests. Their documentation helped ensure that what happened in remote waters could not be hidden or denied. By bearing witness with cameras and testimonies, they turned attempts at intimidation into evidence that fueled international outrage and solidarity.

The name “Rainbow Warrior” itself carries a deeper meaning that has long inspired Greenpeace’s work. It draws from a prophecy about protectors of the Earth coming together from around the world to defend the planet. For many within the movement, that name has served as a reminder that this work is both global and deeply interconnected—that people from different backgrounds, genders, and cultures are all needed in the struggle to protect life on Earth.

The women who helped found Greenpeace and shape its earliest campaigns did more than support a movement; they defined it. From Dorothy Stowe’s moral clarity to Marie Bohlen’s daring proposal to sail into nuclear test zones, from Dorothy Metcalfe’s media and lobbying work to Linda Spong and Bobbi Hunter’s frontline whale blockades, from Susi Newborn and Denise Bell’s work bringing the Rainbow Warrior to life to Ann-Marie Horne and Mary Lornie’s documentation of French assaults, their contributions are woven into every major chapter of Greenpeace’s early history.

To honor them is to remember that Greenpeace was never just about ships and banners—it was, and remains, about people who refuse to stand by in the face of injustice. The legacy of these women continues wherever communities rise to defend the Earth, guided by the same spirit that first set a small boat on course toward a nuclear test site, and gave a ship the name Rainbow Warrior.
