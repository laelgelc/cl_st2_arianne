Greenpeace campaigner Asti Roesle is raising serious concerns about the Forest Stewardship Council’s (FSC) decision to re-associate with the timber group Danzer. Danzer had previously been disassociated in 2013 over human rights violations in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), and Roesle argues that the conditions for rebuilding trust have not yet been met.

According to Roesle, FSC’s process for re-associating with Danzer has not been sufficiently rigorous. She points out that violations occurred early on in the process and highlights that key safeguards are still not properly in place. In particular, she notes the failure to implement Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC), as recommended by the Forest Peoples Programme. FPIC is a fundamental principle for protecting the rights of forest communities, and its absence is a major red flag in such a high-risk context.

Roesle acknowledges that there have been some benefits for local communities under Danzer’s operations. However, she maintains that these positive steps do not justify FSC’s decision to move ahead with re-association at this stage. In her view, it is simply too soon to restore the FSC seal of approval to a company with such a serious track record in a vulnerable region.

She is calling on FSC to put environmental and social concerns ahead of business interests, especially in high-risk areas like the DRC. That means tightening standards, ensuring that human rights protections are genuinely in place, and not rushing to bring companies back into the fold before they have clearly demonstrated lasting change.

Looking ahead, Roesle urges FSC to come to its September General Assembly with strong, concrete measures that reflect the gravity of the issues at stake. For her, this is a crucial moment for FSC to show that its commitment to forests and forest peoples is not negotiable, and that its label must be earned through real accountability and robust safeguards on the ground.
