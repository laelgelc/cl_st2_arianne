Samsung’s decision to recall 4.3 million Galaxy Note 7 phones after nearly 100 reported explosion cases is first and foremost a safety issue. But it is also an environmental issue on a staggering scale.

Those 4.3 million phones add up to around 730,000 kilograms of technology. Samsung has said it will dispose of these devices and has ruled out repairing, refurbishing, or reselling them. The company sold 1.8 million Note 7s in 10 countries and is now collecting them from consumers worldwide.

What happens next to this mountain of electronics matters.

If these phones are simply dumped or burned, the result would be a huge amount of preventable waste and avoidable environmental harm. Inside each device are valuable and finite materials such as gold, cobalt, and tungsten. If the Note 7s are treated as rubbish instead of resources, those precious materials will be lost, and more mining and processing will be needed to replace them.

Greenpeace is calling on Samsung to be transparent about how it will handle this recall. The company should publish clear, detailed plans for how the phones will be dismantled, how components will be reused where safe, and how metals and other materials will be recovered. Safe recovery of materials like gold, cobalt, and tungsten through proper dismantling and recycling is essential to reduce environmental impacts.

This crisis gives Samsung an unexpected opportunity. Rather than letting millions of devices become waste, the company can choose to lead the electronics industry by showing what responsible product design, take-back, and recycling can look like on a global scale. By prioritizing reuse and high-quality material recovery, Samsung can start to turn a dangerous product failure into a turning point for more sustainable electronics.
