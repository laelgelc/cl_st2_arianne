Siberia is becoming one of the most alarming frontlines of the climate crisis. In recent years, mega fires have swept through vast stretches of Taiga forest, turning what was once a remote, seemingly endless wilderness into a stark symbol of escalating climate impacts.

These fires are not isolated or small-scale. Since 2020, around 19 million hectares of forest have burned in Russia—an area larger than Greece. Much of this destruction has taken place in Far Eastern Russia and Eastern Siberia, where flames have raged across the landscape, often far from major roads or towns, but with consequences that reach deep into cities and communities.

Thick smoke from these fires has repeatedly blanketed Russian cities in haze, degrading air quality and making it difficult for people to breathe safely. This has been especially dangerous during the COVID-19 pandemic, when respiratory health is already under severe strain. The combination of polluted air and a respiratory virus intensifies risks for vulnerable people and adds pressure on healthcare systems.

Despite the scale of the crisis, firefighting efforts have been inadequately resourced. Authorities have not provided the level of support, equipment, or personnel needed to manage fires of this magnitude. This leaves communities more exposed to danger and allows fires to burn longer and more intensely, releasing enormous amounts of carbon into the atmosphere and further driving climate change.

Greenpeace Russia has been on the ground documenting the reality of these fires. In the Krasnoyarsk region, Greenpeace teams have recorded the spread and impacts of the blazes, helping to bring visibility to a disaster that is often unfolding far from international headlines. In the Denezhkin Kamen nature reserve near the Ural Mountains, Greenpeace volunteers have even been deployed to help fight rare fires in this protected area.

These fires in Denezhkin Kamen were triggered by a combination of drought, heatwaves, and lightning—conditions that are increasingly associated with a warming climate. When forests that are normally too wet or cool to burn begin to catch fire, it is a clear warning sign of how fast the climate is changing.

What is happening in Siberia is a climate emergency. The Taiga is a massive carbon store and a critical part of the global climate system. As it burns, not only are local communities, wildlife, and ecosystems put at risk, but the stability of the global climate is further undermined.

Authorities must stop cutting back on forest protection. Weakening protections and underfunding firefighting in the face of such a crisis is reckless. Instead, there must be a renewed commitment to safeguarding forests, supporting frontline responders, and protecting the people who live with the consequences of these fires every day.

Protecting Siberia’s forests is not only about preserving a distant landscape. It is about defending the health of communities, the stability of our climate, and the shared future of people and the planet.
