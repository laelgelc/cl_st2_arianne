The recovery of the ozone layer is one of the clearest examples that coordinated global action can work. The Montreal Protocol, agreed in 1987 to phase out ozone-depleting substances, has led to measurable healing of the ozone layer and shown that governments can respond effectively when science, public pressure and political will align. This success is a powerful reminder that environmental protection is possible at a planetary scale.

Yet, set against the broader state of the planet, this achievement stands out as an exception rather than the rule. The overall trajectory of environmental health is moving in the wrong direction. The 2017 “World Scientists’ Warning to Humanity” lays out how, since 1992, many key indicators of ecological stability have deteriorated further instead of improving.

Freshwater resources have declined by 26%, even as demand continues to grow. Fisheries have shrunk by 6.4%, reflecting overexploitation and degradation of marine ecosystems. Ocean dead zones—areas so depleted of oxygen that most marine life cannot survive—have increased by 75%, a stark signal of nutrient pollution and warming waters. Forest cover has fallen by another 2.8%, eroding one of our most important buffers against climate change and biodiversity loss.

Biodiversity itself has suffered a 28.9% decline, underscoring the rapid loss of species and ecosystems that underpin food systems, clean water, and climate stability. CO2 emissions have risen by 62% since 1960, driving more extreme weather, sea-level rise, and ecosystem disruption. Over the same period, human population has grown by 35%, amplifying pressure on already stressed natural systems. Soil productivity is also in decline, threatening long-term food security and resilience.

These numbers are not abstract. They map out a world in which life-support systems are being pushed beyond safe limits. The warning from scientists is clear: incremental change is no longer enough. The gap between what is needed and what is being done is widening.

The call to action is broad but concrete. Expanding protected reserves on land and at sea is essential to safeguard remaining ecosystems and give nature space to recover. Restoring damaged ecosystems—from forests and wetlands to rivers and coastal zones—can help rebuild resilience, store carbon, and protect communities from climate impacts.

Reducing waste in all forms—energy, food, materials—is a critical step in lowering pressure on natural resources. Addressing population growth, with a focus on equity and access to education and healthcare, is another part of easing long-term demand on ecosystems. Shifting diets away from resource-intensive patterns can significantly cut emissions, land use, and water consumption.

Divesting from fossil fuels and accelerating the transition to cleaner energy sources is central to stabilising the climate and reducing pollution. At the same time, revising economic systems so they operate within ecological limits is vital. That means moving away from models that depend on endless material growth and towards economies designed for sustainability and long-term wellbeing.

These warnings build on a long history of concern about the relationship between human societies and the natural world, from early thinkers like Malthus to modern scientific assessments. The message has become more urgent, not less. The recovery of the ozone layer shows what is possible when the world acts decisively. The task now is to bring that same level of commitment to the wider environmental crises we face, before the remaining windows for meaningful action close.
