Greenpeace is bringing people together across Austria and Germany for what is set to be the largest clothes swap party ever held in both countries. In more than 40 cities, around 10,000 participants are expected to exchange some 50,000 items of clothing. Instead of buying new, people are meeting locally to swap what they no longer wear for something they’ll enjoy using again.

This action is part of Greenpeace’s Detox campaign, which calls for clean, non-toxic textile production worldwide. The way we currently consume clothing is putting enormous pressure on people and the planet. Clothing consumption doubles every decade, and many of the cheapest items are worn only a few times before being thrown away. Far too often, these garments end up in landfills or are incinerated, wasting resources and adding to pollution.

The environmental impact of the textile industry is especially visible in freshwater systems. In countries such as China, textile production contributes significantly to water pollution, with hazardous substances from dyeing and finishing processes contaminating rivers and lakes. Detox demands that brands and suppliers move away from toxic chemicals and toward safer, transparent production methods.

The clothes swap events show that there are real, practical alternatives to fast fashion. Instead of constantly buying new, people can resell, repair, rent, share, and swap. Extending the life of clothes cuts waste, reduces demand for new production, and helps keep harmful chemicals out of the environment.

More and more secondhand and eco-fashion options are becoming available. People who want to change their habits can now find shops and initiatives that focus on reused or organically produced clothing. An interactive map helps make these alternatives easier to access, guiding people toward places where they can buy secondhand, choose organic textiles, or join in swapping and sharing.

By coming together to swap instead of shop, participants in over 40 cities are showing that a different way of dressing is already possible. Every garment that is exchanged instead of bought new is a step away from fast fashion and a step toward a cleaner textile industry.
