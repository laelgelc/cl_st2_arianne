Across Europe and around the world, people are living through a climate crisis that is being driven by fossil fuels. Behind the rising temperatures, deadly air pollution, and extreme weather that is forcing millions from their homes stand powerful fossil fuel companies and politicians who have delayed real action for decades. They make big promises, talk about solutions, and launch glossy “green” campaigns, but continue to sabotage the deep emission cuts we urgently need. Their empty words and false solutions come at a devastating cost, especially for the most vulnerable communities.

Fossil fuel companies and their political allies have perfected the art of distraction. Instead of taking responsibility for the damage they cause, they pour money into advertising and sponsorships that paint them as part of the solution. They promote minor tweaks and distant targets while expanding the very activities that drive the crisis. This is not just spin; it is a deliberate strategy to buy time, protect profits, and delay the transition away from coal, oil, and gas.

To stop this cycle of deception, a European Citizens Initiative is calling for a ban on fossil fuel propaganda. The proposal is simple but powerful: collect 1 million signatures across the EU to demand a law that prohibits advertising and sponsorships for fossil fuels, for the transport services that depend on them, and for the companies involved. Just as public pressure once forced governments to act against tobacco advertising, this initiative aims to end the ability of fossil fuel interests to use marketing to mislead the public and block climate action. It is a concrete step towards a #FossilFreeRevolution.

The comparison with Big Tobacco is not accidental. For years, tobacco companies denied the harm their products caused, funded doubt, and used marketing to appear responsible while millions suffered and died. Today, Big Oil follows the same playbook. Companies like Shell and BP deny their full responsibility for the climate crisis, use greenwashed campaigns to distract from their core business, and rely on advertising to delay the phase-out of fossil fuels. Their marketing is not neutral communication; it is a weapon against science-based climate policy.

The consequences of this obstruction are already all around us. Fossil fuel pollution poisons the air, causing deadly health impacts. The heating of our planet is driving species to extinction at a terrifying rate. Extreme weather events, supercharged by climate change, are devastating homes, livelihoods, and entire regions, displacing millions of people who have done the least to cause the problem. Every year of delay means more lives lost, more ecosystems destroyed, and more communities pushed to the brink.

Banning fossil fuel advertising and sponsorships is about more than cleaning up billboards and sports jerseys. It is about breaking the grip of an industry whose lies and false solutions are holding back the rapid, fair transition we need. By supporting the European Citizens Initiative and building a #FossilFreeRevolution, people across Europe can help cut through the propaganda, hold fossil fuel companies to account, and demand real action that protects people and the planet.
