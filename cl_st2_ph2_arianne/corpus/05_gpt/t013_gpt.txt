As governments from across Europe gather for the Council of Europe’s Reykjavik Summit on 16–17 May 2023, they face a defining choice: whether to finally recognize the human right to a clean, healthy, and sustainable environment.

This is not an abstract debate. Europe is in the grip of a triple planetary crisis: pollution, climate change, and biodiversity loss are converging to threaten lives, livelihoods, and the very systems that sustain us. Air pollution alone kills an estimated 1,200 children every year in Europe. Behind each number is a family, a community, and a future cut short. At the same time, wars and armed conflicts are leaving a toxic legacy, with environmental harms that persist long after the fighting stops.

Despite these mounting threats, there is still a glaring gap in the European human rights framework. While many environmental protections exist in different forms, the right to a clean, healthy, and sustainable environment is not yet explicitly recognized in the European Convention on Human Rights. This leaves people across the continent without the strongest possible legal shield when pollution poisons their air and water, when climate impacts intensify, or when ecosystems are degraded beyond repair.

The United Nations has already taken an important step by affirming this right at the global level. Now, it is time for Europe to catch up. A dedicated protocol to the European Convention on Human Rights would:

- Strengthen protection for everyone in Europe facing environmental harms.
- Drive more ambitious climate action by making clear that a safe climate is essential to human rights.
- Provide greater legal certainty for states, courts, and communities.
- Offer stronger safeguards for environmental defenders who speak out to protect people and planet.

Recognizing this right would not be a symbolic gesture. It would embed environmental protection at the heart of Europe’s human rights system, ensuring that governments are held to account when they fail to protect people from pollution, climate chaos, and ecological destruction.

As the Reykjavik Summit approaches, Council of Europe member states must seize this opportunity. The decisions made there can help determine whether Europe responds to the triple planetary crisis with the urgency and fairness it demands.

You can help push this onto the political agenda. Use your voice by tweeting your representatives and urging them to support recognition of the right to a clean, healthy, and sustainable environment. Stay engaged by signing up for campaign updates so you can act at key moments.

This is a crucial chance to close a dangerous gap in Europe’s human rights architecture. The health of our children, our communities, and our shared environment depends on it.
