In 2017, supporters around the world stood with Greenpeace International during one of the most challenging periods in its history. At a time when corporations sought to silence environmental activism through lawsuits totalling more than a billion dollars, people power made it possible to keep speaking out and taking action.

Greenpeace International faced aggressive legal attacks from Resolute Forest Products and Energy Transfer Partners—cases clearly intended to intimidate and discourage peaceful advocacy. Instead, this pressure strengthened the resolve of supporters, staff, and volunteers to defend the right to protect forests, water, climate, and communities. The 2017 Annual Report is, above all, a message of gratitude to everyone who helped ensure that these attempts to silence criticism did not succeed.

Amid this legal onslaught, Greenpeace groups around the world continued to secure important environmental gains. One of the most visible examples was Make SMTHNG Week, a global series of events that encouraged people to choose creativity and repair over endless consumption. Workshops, skill-shares, and community gatherings showed that a different kind of economy—based on making, mending, and sharing—is not only possible but already taking shape in cities and towns across the globe.

At sea, sustained campaigning put pressure on Thai Union, one of the world’s largest seafood companies, to move towards more sustainable and responsible fishing practices. This work was part of a broader push to protect oceans, fishers’ rights, and marine ecosystems from destructive industrial fishing.

In Europe, hundreds of thousands of people came together around a petition on glyphosate, sending a strong signal to EU decision-makers about public concern over this widely used chemical. In Brazil, campaign efforts contributed to defending the Amazon, a forest vital to the global climate and home to countless species and communities, from escalating threats.

Corporate accountability was another key theme. After sustained public pressure, Samsung shifted its policy on Galaxy phones, marking a step towards more responsible production in the electronics sector. This win illustrated how coordinated campaigning can move even some of the world’s biggest brands.

The Annual Report also underlines that what the public often sees—ships at sea, banner drops, and headline-grabbing actions—is only a fraction of the work. Behind every visible moment lies extensive planning, training, scientific and legal support, and careful management of Greenpeace’s ships and logistical infrastructure. These less visible efforts make it possible to act quickly, safely, and effectively in fast-changing political and environmental conditions.

Internally, Greenpeace International continued to deepen its commitment to diversity and inclusion, recognising that a powerful environmental movement must reflect and respect the communities it serves. The organization also worked to integrate the lessons and demands of the #MeToo movement, addressing power imbalances and fostering safer, more equitable spaces for staff, volunteers, and partners.

Across all these areas, 2017 was a year of both resistance and progress. Campaigns helped accelerate coal phase-outs, push financial institutions to divest from fossil fuels, and expose unfair trade deals that threaten environmental protections and democratic decision-making. Each of these achievements depended on collaboration—between local communities, global networks, partner organizations, and millions of individual supporters.

The message running through the 2017 Annual Report is clear: despite mounting pressure from powerful interests, collective action is working. By standing together—in courtrooms, in communities, online, and in the streets—people are driving the shift away from destructive industries and towards a fairer, more sustainable world. The report closes with a call to keep building this shared effort, because the challenges ahead demand nothing less than continued courage, solidarity, and determination from all who believe in a livable planet.
