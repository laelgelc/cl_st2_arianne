In many farming and fishing communities across the Philippines, generations of traditional weather knowledge once guided daily life. Elders could read the sky, winds, tides, and seasons to decide when to plant, harvest, set out to sea, or seek shelter. These patterns formed the backbone of local food systems and cultural practices. Today, that knowledge is being upended.

Climate change is disrupting the rhythms that people have relied on for decades. Typhoons are more frequent and intense, floods more destructive, and droughts more prolonged. Rains no longer come when they are expected. What used to be reliable signals in nature now often mislead, leaving farmers and fishers exposed to failed harvests, lost catch, and dangerous working conditions. This erosion of traditional knowledge is not just a cultural loss; it directly threatens food security and people’s well-being.

These impacts are magnified by existing poverty and weak governance. Many rural communities already lack adequate infrastructure, social protection, and access to services. When crops fail or boats are damaged, there are few safety nets. Poorly planned development, insufficient disaster preparedness, and a lack of support for sustainable livelihoods deepen the harm. Climate disasters do not strike a level playing field; they hit hardest where people have the least resources and political power.

In this context, the word “resilience” is often used to describe how communities cope with crisis after crisis. But resilience can become a double-edged term. It is frequently invoked in ways that place the burden on people to adapt and “bounce back,” while powerful actors who drive the climate crisis escape scrutiny. When governments and fossil fuel companies celebrate community resilience without addressing their own responsibility, the term risks masking injustice instead of confronting it.

Communities in the Philippines have pushed back against this imbalance. In 2015, a group of Filipino individuals and organizations filed a petition against major fossil fuel companies—often referred to as “carbon majors.” They asked for these companies to be investigated for their role in contributing to climate change and the resulting human rights impacts. This effort led to a landmark human rights investigation in 2019, which examined how climate harms intersect with fundamental rights like life, health, food, and housing. The petition signaled that those on the frontlines of the crisis are not only victims; they are also demanding accountability.

The urgency of their call is echoed in the latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The report warns that climate risks are escalating and that mortality will be higher in vulnerable areas, especially where people are already facing social and economic disadvantages. It underscores that limiting warming to 1.5°C is still critical to avoid even more catastrophic impacts, but that this requires far-reaching action on multiple fronts.

According to the report, protecting and restoring ecosystems is essential. Healthy forests, wetlands, coasts, and oceans can buffer communities from extreme weather, support food systems, and store carbon. At the same time, adaptation measures must be strengthened so that communities can better cope with the impacts that are already unavoidable. This includes approaches that are grounded in local realities and knowledge, even as those knowledge systems are being strained by a changing climate.

The report also highlights the importance of addressing loss and damage—those harms that go beyond what people can adapt to. For communities facing repeated typhoons, floods, and droughts, loss and damage is not an abstract concept; it is the reality of ruined homes, lost livelihoods, and deepening debt. Recognizing and responding to this is a matter of justice.

Climate justice runs through all of these issues. It means acknowledging that those least responsible for greenhouse gas emissions are often the most exposed to climate impacts. It means shifting the focus from praising communities for their resilience to demanding that governments and fossil fuel companies act in line with science and human rights. It means ensuring that measures to limit warming to 1.5°C, protect ecosystems, scale up adaptation, and address loss and damage are shaped by—and accountable to—the people whose lives are most at stake.

In the Philippines, the disruption of traditional weather knowledge is a stark reminder that climate change is not a distant threat but a present reality. As farmers and fishers navigate an increasingly unpredictable world, their struggles and demands point to what is truly needed: not just resilience, but responsibility, reparations, and real climate action.
