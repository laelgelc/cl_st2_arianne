On the International Day of Rural Women, the voices of women from Spain’s rural areas are challenging the dominant narrative about what it means to live – and resist – in the countryside. Far from being passive or disconnected, they are at the forefront of the fight against industrial farming and its impacts on people, animals, and the planet.

The Coordinadora Estatal Stop Ganadería Industrial brings together local groups across Spain that are standing up to the expansion of industrial livestock farming. For women like Montse, Pilar, and Remedios, this coordination is essential. It helps connect dispersed struggles, share information, and build a common front against powerful agribusiness interests.

Remedios’s story is one of direct confrontation with industrial farming in her own town, where she has fought the establishment of a pig farm. Her experience reflects the reality of many rural communities that find themselves facing large-scale livestock projects imposed from above, often without meaningful local participation.

Pilar focuses her efforts on challenging harmful agricultural models and advocating for organic farming. Her stance underlines that resistance is not only about saying “no” to destructive practices, but also about defending and promoting healthier, fairer alternatives in rural territories.

Montse raises the alarm about reservoir pollution linked to industrial farming. Her concern is rooted in everyday life: the quality of water, the health of ecosystems, and the long-term viability of rural communities that depend on clean natural resources.

All three women highlight how the Coordinadora serves as a bridge between rural areas and cities. It helps inform urban populations about what is happening in the countryside, coordinates local struggles so they are not isolated, and amplifies rural voices that are too often ignored in public debate.

By joining forces with the Coordinadora Estatal Stop Ganadería Industrial on this International Day of Rural Women, Greenpeace Spain is helping to shine a light on the organizing led by these women. Their work exposes the true cost of industrial farming and demonstrates that rural women are not just caretakers of land and community, but also key political actors defending their territories and the environment.
