James (Jon) Castle’s life at sea was defined not just by the ships he captained, but by the moral compass he followed. Born in 1950 and passing in 2018, he left behind a legacy that continues to shape how Greenpeace and wider movements think about courage, responsibility, and resistance.

Castle was a legendary Greenpeace captain, renowned for his maritime skill, coolness under pressure, and unwavering sense of right and wrong. For him, the work was never only about navigation or seamanship; it was about steering a course guided by principles, even when the seas – political or literal – were rough.

He skippered Greenpeace ships on some of the organisation’s most iconic and high‑risk campaigns. In the fight against whaling, Castle helped take the struggle directly onto the open ocean, where the brutality of industrial whaling was unfolding out of public sight. His leadership at sea helped turn distant, abstract issues into urgent global concerns.

He also captained ships in the Pacific in opposition to French nuclear testing. These voyages brought Greenpeace into direct confrontation with a nuclear power determined to continue testing, and they demanded a rare combination of tactical skill and moral resolve. Castle was at the heart of that confrontation, taking a stand against a practice that threatened oceans, communities, and the global environment.

In 1995, Castle played a central role in one of Greenpeace’s most famous direct actions: the campaign against Shell’s plan to dispose of the Brent Spar oil storage and tanker-loading buoy in the North Sea. As captain, he led occupations of the Brent Spar that captured worldwide attention. These actions helped spark a wave of global protests that reshaped public debate about corporate responsibility and ocean protection. The campaign contributed to a policy shift that included a ban on dumping installations in the North Sea, marking a turning point in how governments and companies approached offshore disposal.

Castle’s impact, however, went far beyond specific victories at sea. He consistently argued that activism must be grounded in moral courage, self‑reflection, and a refusal to be co‑opted by corporatism. For him, resistance was not a performance, but a disciplined practice of asking hard questions: about power, about complicity, and about whether movements were truly living up to the values they claimed to defend.

His commitment to justice took many forms over the years. He joined protests such as the Diego Garcia invasion, confronting geopolitical decisions that displaced people and militarised entire regions. Later in life, he helped run a soup kitchen, continuing his dedication to solidarity and care in a very different context from the high seas. Whether challenging nuclear tests in the Pacific or serving people in need on land, he remained driven by the same core belief: that doing what is right matters, regardless of scale or visibility.

Those who worked with Castle remember not just his bravery, but his humanity. He was known as compassionate and inspiring, someone who could hold a line in a storm while also holding space for others to reflect, question, and grow. His integrity gave weight to his words; his actions gave hope that courage, when anchored in ethics, can change the course of events.

James (Jon) Castle’s story is a reminder that ships, campaigns, and even historic policy changes are ultimately shaped by individuals willing to act on their convictions. His life challenges us to bring the same moral clarity and courage to the struggles we face today – on the water, on the streets, and in the quiet places where we decide what kind of world we are willing to stand up for.
