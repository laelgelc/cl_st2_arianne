Greenpeace Argentina, together with local organizations, has taken the Argentine State to court through a class action lawsuit and an injunction to stop new offshore oil projects in the country. The legal action challenges resolutions that approved offshore exploration permits for major oil companies, including ExxonMobil and Shell, as well as seismic blasting activities off the coast of Buenos Aires.

The lawsuit argues that these projects violate constitutional rights to a healthy environment. Offshore exploration and seismic blasting threaten marine biodiversity and coastal ecosystems, and they deepen the climate crisis at a time when science and justice demand the opposite: a rapid and fair transition away from fossil fuels. According to the claim, these activities primarily benefit large corporations, while the environmental, social, and climate costs are borne by communities, nature, and future generations.

A central demand of the case is that the Argentine justice system recognize a stable climate as a human right. This would place climate protection at the heart of public policy and decision-making, requiring the State to prioritize renewable energy over new fossil fuel developments. The lawsuit emphasizes that continuing to expand offshore oil exploration is incompatible with protecting human rights and environmental integrity.

The legal action in Argentina is part of a broader global wave of climate litigation. The plaintiffs draw on successful climate cases in the Netherlands, Germany, France, and Brazil, where courts have ordered governments and companies to strengthen climate action and respect environmental rights. These precedents show that the law can be a powerful tool to hold states and corporations accountable for their role in the climate emergency.

Beyond the courtroom, resistance to offshore oil expansion in Argentina has taken to the streets. Protests have mobilized thousands of people, demonstrating broad public opposition to new fossil fuel projects and support for a renewable, just energy future. This combination of legal action and social mobilization seeks not only to stop specific offshore projects, but also to set a precedent that protects the rights of present and future generations to a healthy environment and a stable climate.
