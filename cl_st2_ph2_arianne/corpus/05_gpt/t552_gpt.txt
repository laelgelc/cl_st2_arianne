The Amazon Reef is one of the most unique and little-known ecosystems on Earth. Stretching between Brazil and French Guiana, this remarkable reef lies at depths of up to 200 meters, where scientists once thought a reef system like this couldn’t exist. It is a vital and diverse habitat, home to an array of marine life, and it plays a crucial role in the health of the wider ocean.

In 2018, 2 million people around the world came together to defend this extraordinary place. Their voices helped secure a major victory against oil giant Total, stopping the company from drilling for oil in the Amazon Reef region. That win showed the power of global solidarity and public pressure in protecting our oceans from destructive industries.

But the reef is under threat again. Since 2016, BP has been trying to drill for oil in the same region. If drilling goes ahead, the risk of an oil spill would hang over the Amazon Reef and the surrounding ocean. The impacts would not be limited to Brazil’s coastline. Oil could spread far beyond, contaminating mangroves, smothering the reef, and harming wildlife, including whales and turtles that depend on these waters.

Any new oil extraction in this region would also fuel the climate crisis. At a time when the world urgently needs to move away from fossil fuels, opening up a fragile and irreplaceable ecosystem to oil drilling pushes us in the wrong direction. The Amazon Reef should be off-limits to companies whose business model is based on extracting and burning more oil.

There is another path. Governments now have a crucial opportunity to adopt a strong Global Ocean Treaty that can help protect places like the Amazon Reef. A robust treaty would make it possible to create marine protected areas on the high seas and put the needs of people and planet ahead of corporate profit. It would be a major step toward safeguarding the global ocean for future generations.

To support this effort, Greenpeace’s Pole to Pole expedition will spend five weeks documenting the Amazon Reef region. By gathering evidence and sharing images and stories from this hidden world, the expedition aims to show just how important this area is—and how much we stand to lose if oil companies are allowed to move in. This documentation will help build the case for strong ocean protection and increase pressure on governments and corporations.

Everyone can play a role in this fight. The 2018 victory against Total was only possible because millions of people took action together. Now, as BP pushes to drill in the Amazon Reef region, public pressure is once again essential. You can help protect this unique ecosystem, defend wildlife like whales and turtles, and push back against the expansion of the oil industry into one of the world’s most fragile environments.
