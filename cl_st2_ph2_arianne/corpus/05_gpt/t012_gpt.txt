The Brazilian Amazon is one of the most biodiverse regions on the planet, but illegal gold mining is tearing through this richness and leaving a toxic wake behind.

In the rivers, mining releases mercury and large amounts of sediments. This pollution clouds the water, blocking sunlight that aquatic plants and algae need to survive. With less light, food chains begin to unravel. Fish struggle to hunt in the murky water and can even have their respiration affected. In the headwaters, where many species spawn, this disruption can interfere with reproduction and the survival of new generations of fish.

Excavators make this destruction even faster and more extensive. By rapidly tearing up riverbanks and forest soils, they intensify sediment loads in rivers and accelerate the loss of habitat both in the water and on land.

In 2022, a Greenpeace expedition travelled to remote and previously unstudied areas of the Brazilian Amazon. The findings underscored how much we still don’t know about this forest and how much is at risk. The region harbours unknown species and a vast diversity of soil microorganisms that are crucial for medicine and agriculture. These microscopic communities support plant growth, nutrient cycling and resilience, and they hold potential for new treatments and innovations. When mining degrades soils and forests, it threatens these invisible allies as well.

The expansion of illegal mining is being driven in part by a growing network of airstrips. There are now 320 airstrips on Indigenous lands, enabling miners to reach deeper into the forest, bring in heavy machinery and supplies, and move gold out. Each new airstrip and mining site means more vegetation cleared, more forest fragmented, and more pressure on wildlife.

On the ground, miners also hunt animals such as monkeys and capybaras. This goes far beyond a direct loss of individual animals. Many of these species are key seed dispersers and pollinators. When they are killed or driven away, the forest’s ability to regenerate is compromised, as fewer seeds are spread and fewer plants are pollinated. At the same time, this hunting puts miners in direct competition with Indigenous Peoples for food, undermining local food security and deepening social and ecological conflicts.

All of this destruction is happening in a forest that is essential for climate stability, water cycles, and cultural survival. Continuing down this path is not an option. The impacts of illegal gold mining on rivers, soils, wildlife, and Indigenous communities show that the current model of exploitation is fundamentally incompatible with a living Amazon.

A new development model is urgently needed—one that preserves the forest instead of destroying it, values its biodiversity and invisible soil life, and respects the rights and knowledge of the Indigenous Peoples who have protected it for generations. The future of the Brazilian Amazon depends on it.
