Over 9 out of 10 people on this planet breathe unsafe air. On a day meant to celebrate our natural world, this reality turns World Environment Day into a stark reminder that air pollution is not just an environmental issue—it is a global health crisis that affects every species that breathes.

June 5 is often marked by events, speeches, and hopeful messages. But can we truly celebrate while the very air we depend on is making us sick? Instead of celebration alone, this day must also be about demanding our basic right to clean air, clean energy, and a greener environment.

Air pollution is often invisible, but its impacts are not. We see them in our hospitals, in rising respiratory illnesses, in shortened lives and diminished wellbeing. If the pollution we inhale every day were suddenly visible, it would stain the skies, landscapes, and cityscapes we cherish, revealing how deeply it mars the beauty of our world.

Much of this crisis is tied to how we produce and use energy. Coal, extracted from deep underground, travels a long and destructive path before it ever reaches a light switch. From the moment it is mined to the moment it powers our homes, coal leaves a trail of pollution that chokes the air and the lives of those who live and work around it.

On this World Environment Day, the choice is clear: accept this as normal, or demand something better. Clean air is not a luxury or a distant aspiration; it is a fundamental right. Clean energy and a greener environment are not abstract ideals; they are the practical alternatives we must insist on, for our health and for the health of all living beings who share this air.

This piece invites you to trace coal’s journey—from underground extraction to the electricity that flows into our homes—and to confront the human and environmental costs hidden behind the flip of a switch. It is a call to see what is usually unseen, to question what is presented as inevitable, and to stand up for a world where breathing does not come with a hidden price.
