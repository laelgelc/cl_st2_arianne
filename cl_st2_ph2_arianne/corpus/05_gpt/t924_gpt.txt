Nature lovers across the globe are speaking out, calling on outdoor giants Mammut and The North Face to remove hazardous PFCs from their products. Their message is simple: if you love nature, your gear shouldn’t pollute it. PFC-free alternatives are already available, and people who hike, climb, camp and explore the outdoors want equipment that protects the places they cherish, not products that contribute to contamination.

Greenpeace is urging these brands to “detox now” and live up to the values they promote in their marketing and communities. Outdoor enthusiasts expect the companies they trust to lead on sustainability, not lag behind it. That means moving away from hazardous PFCs across all product lines and embracing safer, non-polluting solutions.

Recent protests in 13 countries have shown just how widespread and determined this demand has become. From one continent to another, people are uniting around a shared goal: gear that keeps them dry on the mountain without leaving a toxic footprint in nature.

The North Face has announced plans to phase out PFCs in its apparel by 2020. However, this commitment does not cover all of its gear, leaving a gap between what nature lovers are asking for and what the brand has promised so far.

Mammut, for its part, claims it uses PFCs only in limited cases and has already phased out long-chain PFCs. Yet tests have found PFCs in all of Mammut’s products checked, including long-chain PFCs in some items. Progress toward truly PFC-free gear has been slow, despite the brand’s statements.

Greenpeace is inviting people to take online action and directly demand non-polluting products from these companies. The call is clear: outdoor brands must match their nature-loving image with real, concrete steps to eliminate hazardous PFCs from all their gear and offer truly sustainable alternatives for everyone who loves the natural world.
