In 1971, Coca-Cola aired its now-iconic “Hilltop” commercial, showing a hillside of young people from around the world singing about unity and peace, each holding a glass bottle of Coke. The ad painted Coca-Cola as a symbol of harmony and hope, a brand that could “teach the world to sing.” That image still lingers in popular culture, wrapped in nostalgia and sentimentality.

But behind this carefully crafted vision of togetherness lies a very different reality. Today, Coca-Cola is one of the world’s biggest drivers of plastic pollution, and the communities bearing the brunt of this crisis are not those smiling faces on a sunny hillside. Instead, it is low-income communities and communities of color—often far from the glossy billboards and polished commercials—who are living with the toxic consequences of the company’s single-use plastic addiction.

Coca-Cola’s business model depends heavily on disposable plastic bottles, which are produced from fossil fuel–based petrochemicals. These single-use plastics are pushed into markets around the world, where waste management systems are often underfunded or inadequate. The result is plastic waste piling up in neighborhoods, rivers, and coastlines, especially in countries and communities that have contributed least to the problem and have the fewest resources to deal with it.

This is not just a litter issue. The entire life cycle of single-use plastic—from fossil fuel extraction and petrochemical production to incineration and pollution—drives climate change, damages ecosystems, and harms human health. Communities located near petrochemical plants, landfills, and incinerators are disproportionately low-income and communities of color. They are more likely to breathe polluted air, drink contaminated water, and suffer from related health problems, all while global brands like Coca-Cola continue to profit.

In 2020, Coca-Cola was named the world’s worst plastic polluter for the third year in a row. This is not an accident; it reflects a pattern. Even as plastic waste visibly chokes waterways and clogs communities, Coca-Cola has leaned heavily on the myth that recycling alone can solve the crisis. The company’s messaging often suggests that if consumers simply recycle more, everything will be fine.

But this narrative obscures the core problem: the sheer volume of single-use plastic Coca-Cola puts into the world, and the fossil fuel–based system that underpins it. Recycling cannot keep up with the scale of production. Many plastics are never recycled at all, and those that are can usually only be recycled a limited number of times before becoming waste. Meanwhile, Coca-Cola’s reliance on plastic helps fuel a massive petrochemical buildout—new plants and infrastructure designed to turn fossil fuels into plastics for decades to come.

This petrochemical expansion threatens to lock in high greenhouse gas emissions at a time when the world must rapidly reduce them to have any chance of staying within the 1.5°C climate goal. Every new facility, every new pipeline, and every new plastic production line makes it harder to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. Coca-Cola’s dependence on single-use plastics is not just a packaging choice; it is part of a fossil fuel trajectory that is fundamentally at odds with a safe and just climate future.

The injustice is clear. The same communities that have done the least to cause the climate crisis and plastic pollution are the ones suffering the most. They are living with plastic waste in their streets and waterways, with toxic emissions from petrochemical plants, and with the mounting impacts of climate change. All the while, Coca-Cola continues to wrap its brand in the language of happiness, community, and togetherness—language that rings hollow when set against the realities of pollution and inequality.

To move beyond the gap between the “Hilltop” fantasy and today’s plastic-choked world, Coca-Cola must change course. That means ending its ties to fossil fuel–driven plastic production and abandoning the failed model of single-use plastics. It means stopping the promotion of recycling myths as a smokescreen for overproduction. And it means investing seriously in refill and reuse systems that prioritize people and the planet over disposability and profit.

Refill and reuse models—where containers are returned, washed, and refilled—offer a way to reduce waste, cut emissions, and ease the burden on communities already overwhelmed by pollution. For a company with Coca-Cola’s reach and resources, shifting to these systems is not only possible; it is necessary if the brand’s messages of unity and care are to mean anything in the real world.

The “Hilltop” commercial promised a world brought together by a bottle of Coke. Today, a truly responsible Coca-Cola would work to bring people together not through nostalgic advertising, but by confronting its role in plastic pollution, climate change, and environmental injustice—and by committing to a future built on refill, reuse, and freedom from fossil fuel plastics.
