Authors, journalists, poets, and playwrights have long helped change the world by freely expressing bold and challenging ideas. Their words can expose hidden harms, inspire collective action, and push societies toward greater justice. That is why free speech is essential for positive change—and why attempts to silence critical voices are so dangerous.

In response to multimillion-dollar lawsuits filed by the Canadian company Resolute Forest Products, more than 100 authors have pledged to stand up for free expression and to defend those who peacefully protect forests. These lawsuits target Greenpeace and Stand.earth after they exposed controversial logging practices in the boreal forest. By seeking massive financial penalties, the legal actions threaten not just the organizations involved, but the broader right to question powerful interests and advocate for the environment.

The authors who signed the pledge are using their voices to insist that public debate about forest protection must not be shut down in the courts. Their statements underline a simple but vital principle: people and organizations must be able to speak out about environmental destruction without fear of retaliation. The pledge affirms that defending forests and defending free speech go hand in hand.

The blog post shares quotes from some of these authors, highlighting their support for freedom of expression and solidarity with those who expose harmful practices. It also provides links where readers can see more of the signatories who have joined this effort.

Finally, the post thanks everyone who has stood with writers, advocates, and forest defenders in celebrating the power of free expression and the right to speak out for the planet.
