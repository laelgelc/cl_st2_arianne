Governments have just left Hobart, Australia, without the agreement the Antarctic Ocean so urgently needs. A new Antarctic Ocean Sanctuary was on the table – a vital step to protect one of the most fragile and important ecosystems on Earth – but the proposal was blocked.

Inside the Antarctic Ocean Commission (CCAMLR), 22 of the 25 countries backed the sanctuary. Yet CCAMLR’s rules demand unanimous agreement, meaning a small minority can stop progress for everyone. This time, Russia, China, and Norway stood in the way, with Russia and China using delaying tactics to stall and ultimately derail the negotiations.

The result is that Antarctic wildlife remains exposed to mounting threats. Overfishing, pollution, and climate change are putting immense pressure on penguins, whales, krill, and the wider web of life that depends on a healthy Antarctic Ocean. Without a sanctuary, industrial interests are still able to push into areas that should be left intact, and governments are failing to keep pace with the speed and scale of the crisis.

This failure in Hobart is not just about one meeting; it shows how the current system is no longer fit to protect our oceans. When a handful of governments can block action supported by the vast majority, it becomes clear that we need stronger global rules.

That is why the call is growing for a new UN global ocean treaty powerful enough to protect at least one-third of the world’s oceans. Such a treaty would help close the gaps left by regional bodies like CCAMLR and create a coherent framework to safeguard marine life on the high seas.

Although this round of talks has ended in disappointment, the movement to defend the Antarctic is far from over. A global community of 2.7 million supporters is already standing behind this campaign, and that pressure will continue to build. Governments may have walked away from Hobart without an agreement, but they have not heard the last from the millions of people demanding protection for the Antarctic and the world’s oceans.
