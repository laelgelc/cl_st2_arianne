The trucks arrive one after another, loaded with toxic fracking waste. Their destination is an illegal dump in Patagonia, where the waste is discarded directly onto the soil, dangerously close to residential areas and water supplies. But today, they are not moving freely. Greenpeace activists are standing in their way.

This action follows an investigation that exposed how fracking waste from companies including Shell and Total is being dumped in this fragile region. The investigation warned these companies about the impacts of their operations and the risks they are creating for people and the environment. Instead of changing course, the trucks kept coming. So Greenpeace activists placed their bodies on the line to stop them.

Patagonia is a place of extraordinary natural beauty, home to unique landscapes and indigenous communities who have lived in balance with the land for generations. For them, the rivers, mountains and plains are not just scenery or resources – they are home, culture and life itself.

Yet for oil executives, this same land is seen through a very different lens: a place to drill, frack and dump waste in the pursuit of profit. Where communities see water that must be protected, they see a convenient place to offload toxic leftovers. Where people see a living territory, they see a sacrifice zone.

This is not an isolated story. Around the world, people-powered movements have stood up to Big Oil and won. Together with allies, communities have pushed back drilling plans and projects in places like the Amazon Reef, the Great Australian Bight, the waters off New Zealand, the Alaskan Arctic and along major oil pipeline routes. Each of these victories has shown that when people organize and resist, even the biggest fossil fuel companies can be stopped.

The science is clear. The latest IPCC report warns of catastrophic climate risks if we continue to burn fossil fuels. To avoid the worst impacts of the climate crisis, oil, coal and gas must stay in the ground. That means no more new drilling, no more new pipelines and no more toxic dumping in places like Patagonia.

Greenpeace activists blocking trucks in Patagonia are part of a growing global movement that refuses to accept a future dominated by oil. Their stand is a call to action for everyone who believes that people and the planet are worth more than fossil fuel profits.

This is the People Vs Oil.

You can be part of it. Join the movement to keep oil in the ground, protect communities and defend the places we all depend on.
