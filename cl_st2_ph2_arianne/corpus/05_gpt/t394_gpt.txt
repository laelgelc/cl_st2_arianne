World leaders and senior politicians are gathering virtually at the UN Summit on Biodiversity to confront the intertwined nature and climate emergencies. As they meet, young climate and nature activists are making it clear that statements and promises are not enough. Through their Wake Up Call, they are demanding real, tangible action to protect people and the planet.

Their message is simple and urgent: leaders must move beyond words and commit to decisions that genuinely safeguard our shared future. A video has been produced to amplify these demands and ensure that the voices of young activists are heard as governments debate how to respond to the crises facing our world.

The post also sets out guidance for how governments can take ambitious steps to protect the oceans, which are central to tackling both biodiversity loss and the climate emergency. These steps are aimed at helping governments turn commitments into concrete measures that defend marine life and support a stable climate.

Environmental ministers and members of UN delegations who want to engage more deeply in discussions on these emergencies are invited to get in touch. They can email veronica.frank@greenpeace.org to join conversations on how to respond with the ambition and urgency that the situation demands.
