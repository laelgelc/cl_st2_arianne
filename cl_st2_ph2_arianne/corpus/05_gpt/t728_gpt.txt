Each winter in Delhi, the air turns into a visible reminder of an invisible crisis. The smog settles in, eyes burn, throats itch, and a grey haze swallows the city. What should be a season of clear skies and cool mornings has become a time when many people dread stepping outside, especially children, the elderly, and those with existing health conditions. For many, the joy of winter has been replaced by the constant search for air purifiers, masks, and ways to stay indoors.

Air pollution is often called a silent killer, but in Delhi and across North India it no longer feels silent. It creeps into homes, schools, workplaces and lungs, contributing to illness and premature deaths. Yet, despite the growing evidence and lived experience, the response has been marked by a troubling complacency. The contrast with other places facing similar crises is stark.

In China, deadly smog in major cities sparked sustained public anger and pressure that pushed authorities to act. In London, outrage over dangerous air quality – especially its impact on children – has driven policies to curb pollution from vehicles and other sources. In both cases, public health concerns and citizen mobilisation forced air pollution onto the political agenda and kept it there.

In India, by contrast, outrage tends to be seasonal. Each winter, when pollution peaks and air quality indices hit “severe” levels, there is a surge of media coverage, social media posts and public concern. But as temperatures rise and the smog lifts, the urgency fades. This cyclical attention has so far prevented the kind of sustained, people-led movement needed to drive lasting change.

The health stakes could not be clearer. A study by researchers at Louisiana State University (LSU) has outlined a path to dramatically reduce the toll of air pollution in India. The study proposes 13 specific measures that, taken together, could cut overall air pollution by 40% and prevent around 900,000 premature deaths every year. In North India, these measures could reduce winter PM2.5 levels by 50–60%. A central pillar of this strategy is curbing emissions from coal-fired power plants, which are a major source of harmful particulates and other pollutants.

These recommended actions are not abstract ideas. They align closely with what has already been put forward to India’s Ministry as part of a broader effort to tackle air pollution. The science is clear, the technical options are on the table, and the potential health benefits are immense.

At the national level, India is in the process of finalising a National Clean Air Programme. On paper, this is a crucial step: a coordinated plan to address air pollution across cities and regions, grounded in evidence and linked to concrete targets. But a plan alone will not clear the air. Implementation will demand more than new rules and guidelines. It will require a fundamental shift in mindset – from treating air pollution as an inevitable by-product of growth, or as a “winter problem”, to recognising it as a year-round public health emergency that demands continuous, collective action.

Personal experiences reflect how deeply this crisis is reshaping everyday life. Winters that were once associated with festivals, outdoor gatherings and crisp morning walks are now remembered for smog, coughs and clinic visits. Families worry about children playing outside. People with asthma or heart conditions plan their days around air quality readings. The emotional toll – the sense of being trapped in one’s own city – is harder to measure, but no less real.

Policy signals have sometimes obscured the scale of the air pollution challenge. In 2022, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced a ban on certain single-use plastics, a move that attracted significant public and media attention. While tackling plastic pollution is important, this announcement also highlighted how easily air pollution can slip from the spotlight. The focus on plastics, however necessary, did not translate into comparable urgency on cleaning the air.

The difference between India and countries like China in this respect is not just about policy design; it is about public pressure. In China, widespread anger over “airpocalypse” episodes helped push the government to adopt and enforce tough measures. In London, parents, health professionals and community groups have demanded cleaner air for their children, sustaining pressure over time. In India, without a similar, continuous groundswell of people-led demand, ambitious plans risk remaining underfunded, under-enforced or quietly sidelined.

Transforming India’s air will require a movement that goes beyond seasonal outrage. It means parents, doctors, teachers, workers, students and residents in polluted neighbourhoods insisting that clean air is non-negotiable. It means treating the LSU study’s findings not as distant projections, but as a roadmap to prevent hundreds of thousands of avoidable deaths each year. It means recognising that cutting emissions from coal plants and other major sources is not just an environmental priority, but a public health necessity.

Delhi’s winters do not have to be defined by smog and sickness. The knowledge, tools and policy frameworks are emerging. What is missing is the sustained public insistence that they be fully used. Until that changes, the silent killer in the air will continue to steal health, joy and years of life from millions across North India.
