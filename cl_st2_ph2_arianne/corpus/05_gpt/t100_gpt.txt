Across the Middle East and North Africa, the climate crisis is no longer a distant warning but a lived reality measured in lives lost, homes destroyed, failing crops and livelihoods under threat. The region is heating at roughly twice the global average, and people are already paying the price.

Communities in Algeria, Egypt, Morocco, Tunisia and the United Arab Emirates are facing unprecedented droughts, floods, heatwaves and other extreme weather events. Fields that once sustained families are withering, water sources are becoming more uncertain, and homes are increasingly vulnerable to storms and flooding. Each new disaster erodes people’s ability to recover, pushing many further into poverty and insecurity.

This injustice is compounded by the fact that those who have historically polluted the most are still refusing to pay for the loss and damage they helped cause. While people across MENA struggle with climate impacts they did little to create, historic polluters continue to delay and dilute responsibility, blocking the financial support that could help communities rebuild and adapt.

Yet the region also holds immense potential for a different path. Transitioning away from fossil fuels and towards renewable energy is not only essential to avert even more catastrophic warming; it is also a powerful route to genuine energy independence. Solar and wind power can help free countries from volatile fossil fuel markets, create jobs, and support more resilient economies that are better able to withstand climate shocks.

This is why COP27 must deliver more than speeches and promises. It must establish a grant-based finance facility that provides real resources for adaptation, mitigation and compensation for loss and damage. Such a mechanism is vital to help communities across MENA and beyond recover from climate disasters, protect people and ecosystems, and invest in a greener, safer future.

People in the Middle East and North Africa are already living with the front-line consequences of a crisis they did not create. They need tangible support, not excuses. A just transition to renewable energy and a robust, grant-based loss and damage facility are essential steps toward climate justice and a livable future for all.
