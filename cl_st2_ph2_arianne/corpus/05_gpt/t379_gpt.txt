Taiwan’s coral reefs are among the most biodiverse on Earth, sheltering around one-third of the world’s coral species and drawing divers from across the globe. Yet beneath the surface beauty, these reefs are in serious trouble.

In recent years, Taiwan has been hit by repeated coral bleaching events: in 2014, 2016, 2017, 2019, and again this year. The main driver is rising ocean temperatures linked to climate change, compounded by pollution. When the water gets too warm, corals become stressed and expel the symbiotic algae living in their tissues. These algae provide corals with both their colour and much of their energy. Once they are gone, the coral turns ghostly white, revealing its skeleton.

Shrimp Roll, a former Greenpeace fundraiser who now works as a diving instructor on Green Island, has witnessed these changes first-hand. He describes seeing “massive bleaching,” with large areas of reef losing their colour as the algae abandon the coral. Even if some corals survive an initial bleaching event, recovery is difficult and far from guaranteed, especially when heat stress keeps returning.

He has also noticed a clear shift in local conditions. Winters that used to bring water temperatures of around 19–20°C are now closer to 23–24°C. That small difference is critical for corals, which are highly sensitive to even slight, prolonged warming.

The situation is not hopeless, but it is urgent. To give Taiwan’s reefs a fighting chance, Shrimp Roll urges people to reduce trash that ends up in the ocean, push for a rapid phase-out of fossil fuels, and support strong climate policies. Cutting pollution and driving down greenhouse gas emissions are essential steps to protect these fragile marine ecosystems and the countless species—and communities—that depend on them.
