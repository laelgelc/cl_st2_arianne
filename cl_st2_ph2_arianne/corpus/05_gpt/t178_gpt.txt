Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has laid bare just how fragile the global food system really is. What might look like a distant war on a map is directly shaping what ends up on plates across the world, especially in regions already on the frontlines of the climate crisis.

The Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region is among the hardest hit. Many countries there depend heavily on grain imports from Ukraine and Russia. When the war disrupted supply chains, it didn’t just affect shipping routes and trade flows on paper; it pushed up food prices and deepened existing vulnerabilities. For people already living with high levels of poverty and political instability, even small price increases can mean the difference between eating enough and going hungry.

These shocks are landing in a region already under intense climate stress. Water scarcity is worsening, and climate impacts are contributing to reduced crop yields. In places where farmers are struggling to grow food because of dwindling water resources and harsher conditions, dependence on imported grain becomes even more entrenched. When that imported supply is disrupted, the result is a dangerous spiral of insecurity.

Yemen is one of the clearest examples of how these crises overlap. The country is already facing a severe humanitarian emergency. The war in Ukraine and the global food price spikes that followed have made a dire situation even worse, compounding existing hunger and deepening the suffering of people who were already in crisis.

Fossil fuels are another major threat to food security in the region. One stark example is the FSO Safer, a decaying oil tanker off the coast of Yemen. It represents a serious environmental risk: any major spill would devastate marine ecosystems and coastal communities. For people who rely on the sea and coastal lands for food and livelihoods, such a disaster would be catastrophic, further undermining their ability to access safe, sufficient food.

These interconnected crises underline that the current food system—built on long, fragile supply chains, fossil fuel dependence, and deep inequalities—is not fit for purpose. The way forward lies in building resilient, local, and sustainable food systems that can withstand shocks, whether from war, climate impacts, or fossil fuel disasters.

The text calls for a shift toward food sovereignty, where communities have control over how their food is produced, distributed, and consumed. Ecological farming is central to this vision, prioritising methods that work with nature rather than against it, protect soils and water, and reduce reliance on fossil fuels and chemical inputs. Community initiatives—such as local markets, cooperative farming, and grassroots food projects—are crucial building blocks of this transformation, helping to shorten supply chains and strengthen local resilience.

Underlying all of this is the demand for climate justice. Rich nations, whose historical emissions and political decisions have played a major role in driving both the climate crisis and global inequality, must take responsibility. That means supporting climate-vulnerable regions like MENA with the resources needed to adapt, rebuild, and create food systems that are fair, sustainable, and able to endure in a rapidly changing world.
