In Oslo, Greenpeace and Nature and Youth have taken the Norwegian government to court over its decision to open new areas of the Arctic to oil drilling.

The lawsuit challenges Norway’s 23rd licensing round, which granted oil companies – including Statoil – new licenses for exploratory drilling in the Arctic. This expansion of fossil fuel activity is being challenged as a direct contradiction of both the Paris climate agreement and Norway’s own constitutional protections for the environment.

By bringing this case, Greenpeace and Nature and Youth are seeking to stop new exploratory wells before they start, keep untapped oil in the ground, and protect the fragile Arctic environment for future generations.

They are not alone. Scientists, activists, and Indigenous leaders from around the world have come together as “Friends of the Case” to stand with this legal challenge. Among them are James Hansen, Bill McKibben, and Bunna Lawrie, whose support underscores the global significance of what is happening in Norway’s Arctic waters.

This is about more than one country’s licensing round. It is about whether governments will honor their climate commitments and safeguard the Arctic rather than opening it up to new drilling.

Supporters everywhere are being asked to add their names to show that people around the world are watching, and that there is broad, global concern about Arctic drilling and its consequences for the climate and for future generations.
