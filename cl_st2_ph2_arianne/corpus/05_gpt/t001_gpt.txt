In 1970, a haunting new sound entered living rooms, classrooms and campaign offices around the world: the long, complex, otherworldly songs of humpback whales. Recorded and shared by biologist Roger Payne, the album “Songs of the Humpback Whale” went on to sell more than 100,000 copies, becoming one of the most influential wildlife recordings in history and helping to spark the global anti‑whaling movement that Greenpeace would soon join and help lead.

For many people, Payne’s work was the first time whales were experienced not as “resources” or “units of oil and meat,” but as fellow beings with voices, culture and emotional lives. The album made it impossible to ignore the violence of industrial whaling. Once you had heard those songs, the sight of a harpoon ship or a flensing deck was no longer an abstract issue of policy or commerce – it was an attack on living, singing communities in the ocean.

Among the early Greenpeace activists moved and empowered by those recordings was Rémi Parmentier. Recognising the power of the whales’ voices to shift public opinion, he used the album directly in campaigning, bringing the songs into meetings, events and media work. In 1978, he helped arrange the album’s release in France, timed to amplify the growing attention around the Rainbow Warrior’s anti‑whaling missions. The same sounds that had travelled through the water now travelled across radio waves and record players, helping build the public pressure that whaling nations could no longer ignore.

The impact of Payne’s work reached far beyond public awareness. The emotional connection he helped forge between people and whales contributed to one of the most significant ocean victories of the 20th century: the 1982 decision by the International Whaling Commission to adopt a moratorium on commercial whaling. That moratorium, still in place today, has given many whale populations a chance to begin recovering from the brink of extermination.

Payne was not only a scientist and communicator, but also an institution builder. He founded Ocean Alliance, an organisation dedicated to the conservation of whales and their ocean environment. Through research and advocacy, Ocean Alliance carried forward the same spirit that animated “Songs of the Humpback Whale”: careful listening, deep respect and a belief that if people truly heard what was at stake, they would choose protection over destruction.

His support for environmental protection extended beyond whaling. In 1982, Kelly Rigg recalls calling on Payne to testify in a case against offshore oil drilling. He responded with generosity and seriousness, lending his authority and insight to the effort. What stood out was not only his scientific expertise, but the way he treated young campaigners as equals – with respect, trust and encouragement. That attitude helped empower a new generation of activists who were still finding their voices, just as he had helped the world hear the voices of whales.

Again and again, Payne’s legacy comes back to listening. He listened to whales – patiently, attentively, over years – and revealed to the world that their sounds were not random noise but intricate songs. He listened to young activists and colleagues with the same care, recognising that movements grow when people feel heard and valued. In doing so, he helped deepen humanity’s connection to the rest of nature, reminding us that the more closely we listen, the harder it becomes to justify cruelty or indifference.

Roger Payne’s life and work show how a single act of listening can change the course of history. By placing a needle on a record player in 1970, millions of people encountered whales in a new way. That encounter helped build a movement, strengthen Greenpeace’s early anti‑whaling campaigns, support the creation of the commercial whaling moratorium, and inspire ongoing efforts to defend the oceans from threats like offshore oil drilling. His legacy lives on every time those songs are heard – and every time we choose to listen, with empathy, to the living world around us.
