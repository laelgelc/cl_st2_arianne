Starbucks Korea’s announcement that it will phase out disposable cups in all its cafes by 2025 marks a major shift for the company, which has so far taken only limited steps to reduce its environmental footprint. This move comes in a world where billions of throwaway cups have become a major source of plastic pollution, and where Starbucks alone is responsible for distributing 6 billion disposable cups every year.

The decision in Korea did not happen in a vacuum. Strong government policies have played a key role in driving this change. Korea has committed to banning disposable cups by 2027, and in 2022 introduced a deposit system for single-use cups, making it easier and more attractive for people to return them. These policy measures have helped push large corporations like Starbucks to rethink their reliance on disposables and to start investing in reusable systems.

Starbucks’ global record on reusables remains mixed. At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the company suspended the use of reusable cups across its stores, citing health and safety concerns. While reusable cup programs have since been resumed in some regions, North America has been notably excluded from this transition. This uneven approach underscores how far the company still has to go to address the scale of its plastic footprint.

Greenpeace is calling on Starbucks to treat the Korean shift as a starting point, not an exception. The organisation urges Starbucks to accept reusable cups in all its stores worldwide, to introduce returnable cup programs in every country where it operates, and to commit to eliminating disposable cups globally by 2025. With 6 billion throwaway cups distributed annually, anything less than a full transition away from disposables will fall short of what is needed to tackle plastic pollution at the source.

The decision in Korea shows that change is possible when strong policies and public pressure align. Now Starbucks must extend this ambition across all its markets, moving beyond limited pilots and partial measures to a truly global, reusable future.
