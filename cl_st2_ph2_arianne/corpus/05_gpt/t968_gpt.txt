Greenpeace has released a powerful new video calling on LEGO to end its partnership with Shell, using the iconic toy bricks to highlight the very real dangers of Arctic oil drilling.

In the film, an imagined oil spill slowly engulfs a LEGO-built Arctic world. What begins as a playful, colourful landscape steadily turns bleak as black oil spreads across ice and water. This miniature catastrophe mirrors the risks posed by Shell’s actual plans to drill in the Arctic, where a spill would be devastating for the fragile ecosystem and the wildlife that depends on it.

Created with the agency Don’t Panic, the video is designed to be widely shared online, using familiar cultural references to reach as many people as possible. It includes cameos inspired by the LEGO Movie, Game of Thrones, and even Santa Claus, all drawn into the unfolding disaster as the oil spreads. By placing these recognisable figures in a collapsing Arctic scene, the film underlines how far-reaching the consequences of Arctic drilling could be.

At the heart of the campaign is a simple question: who should LEGO choose as its partners? LEGO promotes strong environmental values and inspires children to imagine and build a better future. Yet those values sit uneasily alongside Shell’s record of pollution and its drive to open up the Arctic to risky oil exploration.

Greenpeace is calling on LEGO to drop Shell as a partner, to ensure that the company’s commitments to children and the environment are not undermined by association with Arctic drilling. By ending this partnership, LEGO can help protect the Arctic and stand with the children it seeks to inspire, rather than with a company whose plans threaten one of the most vulnerable places on Earth.
