Around the world, people are calling on major banks to stop financing harmful tar sands pipelines like Dakota Access, Kinder Morgan, Keystone XL, and Line 3. These projects threaten Indigenous communities, clean water, wildlife, and the stability of our climate—and they are being pushed forward without consent from the people whose lands and waters are most directly affected.

From October 23–25, Indigenous leaders and allies organized the Mazaska Talks Global Days of Action to demand that banks #DivestTheGlobe. In just three days, there were over 50 protests in more than 60 cities across six countries. Together, these actions sent a clear message to the financial institutions that continue to bankroll destructive pipelines: stop funding projects that violate Indigenous rights and endanger the planet.

Protesters disrupted business as usual at banks including Chase, Toronto-Dominion, and Credit Suisse, exposing their role in financing tar sands expansion. These actions are part of a growing global movement that recognizes that where money flows, destruction often follows—and that shifting financial support away from fossil fuels is essential for protecting communities and ecosystems.

Indigenous communities are on the frontlines of this struggle, defending their lands and waters from unwanted pipeline construction. In some cases, tiny houses have been built directly in the path of proposed routes to physically block construction and assert Indigenous rights. These efforts highlight the ongoing violations of Indigenous sovereignty and the urgent need for banks to respect the right to free, prior, and informed consent.

The movement to divest from tar sands pipelines is gaining strength, but banks will not change course on their own. Public pressure is crucial. One concrete way to support this work is by signing the petition calling on banks to stop financing these dangerous projects. Each signature adds to the collective demand for a financial system that upholds Indigenous rights, safeguards clean water and wildlife, and supports a stable climate for future generations.
