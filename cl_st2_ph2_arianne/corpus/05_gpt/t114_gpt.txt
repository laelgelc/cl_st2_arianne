Across the world, fossil fuel-driven climate change is turning once-rare extremes into everyday reality. Heat waves, wildfires, and droughts are intensifying and overlapping, and without urgent action they risk becoming the new normal.

Recent temperature records show how dangerous this crisis has already become. In Death Valley, temperatures have reached 53°C, pushing the limits of human survivability. In Tunisia, 48°C heat has damaged crops, threatening livelihoods and food security. Deadly heat has struck Spain, Canada, the UK, India, and many other places, with lethal consequences for people and ecosystems.

These impacts are not felt equally. Marginalized communities are hit first and worst: people with the least access to cooling, healthcare, secure housing, or financial safety nets are the most exposed to extreme heat, wildfire smoke, and water shortages. The climate crisis is deepening existing inequalities.

Despite this, fossil fuel companies continue to put profits before people and the planet. Their business model depends on expanding coal, oil, and gas extraction, even as the science is clear that burning these fuels is driving the climate chaos we are living through.

A rapid, just transition to renewable energy is both possible and necessary. The world’s response to COVID-19 showed that governments can move fast, mobilize resources at scale, and reorient entire economies when they decide something is an emergency. The climate crisis demands the same level of urgency and coordination, but with a focus on long-term justice and resilience.

Greenpeace and allies around the world are pushing for this shift. Campaigns are underway to ban fossil fuel advertising that misleads the public and greenwashes pollution. Activists are working to end public and private financing for coal, oil, and gas projects, and to reject new dirty deals that lock us into decades more emissions. Movements are defending and restoring forests, which are vital for stabilizing the climate and protecting biodiversity and communities.

There is still time to keep global heating within the 1.5°C limit set in the Paris Agreement, but only if governments, businesses, and financial institutions stop propping up fossil fuels and accelerate the transition to clean, renewable energy. The choices made today will determine whether deadly heat waves, wildfires, and droughts define our future—or whether we seize this moment to build a safer, fairer, and more sustainable world for everyone.
