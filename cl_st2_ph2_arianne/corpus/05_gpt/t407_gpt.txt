In the Waruá community near São Gabriel da Cachoeira, in the Brazilian Amazon, the Dâw Indigenous People—about 140 individuals—have been living through a stark reminder of their historical vulnerability to disease.

When the COVID-19 pandemic reached the region, the Dâw took protective measures and isolated in the forest for a month. Even with this effort, some members needed to travel into town, and it was during these visits that the virus is believed to have spread. Soon after, almost the entire community began showing symptoms consistent with COVID-19.

Testing in Waruá was limited, but the few tests that were carried out confirmed cases of infection. Despite the high rate of symptoms among the Dâw, there were no deaths reported. Community members turned to herbal teas as part of their care and received medical support from the Indigenous Health Special District (DSEI), along with hygiene supplies that were essential for trying to contain the outbreak and aid recovery.

For the Dâw, the fear sparked by COVID-19 is not only about the present. Community leaders speak openly of their concern about extinction, invoking the memory of past epidemics that devastated Indigenous populations in the Amazon and across Brazil. The arrival of a new virus, spreading quickly through a small community, revives those collective memories of catastrophic loss.

This fear has led Dâw leaders to call for comprehensive testing in their territory and for improvements in healthcare services. They emphasize the need not only for emergency responses in times of crisis, but also for ongoing, reliable health infrastructure that respects and protects Indigenous communities.

At the same time, the Dâw continue efforts to strengthen and revitalize their culture and language. These initiatives are crucial for a people whose numbers are so small and whose history has been marked by repeated threats to their survival. In the midst of a pandemic, the struggle to protect their health is inseparable from the struggle to preserve their identity, language, and way of life.
