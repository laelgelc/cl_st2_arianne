The climate crisis is not gender neutral. Around the world, women and girls are already living with the consequences of a warming planet, and their rights and safety are being put at risk. When we look closely at how the climate crisis unfolds, it becomes clear that gender inequality, human rights, and environmental destruction are deeply connected.

A central part of this connection is access to education. When girls are denied education, they are also denied the tools, knowledge, and opportunities needed to participate in decisions about their lives and their communities. This includes climate decision-making: who sits at the table to design policies, who leads community responses to extreme weather, and whose voices are heard when governments and companies plan our energy future.

Without equal access to education, women are systematically excluded from leadership and from the spaces where climate solutions are shaped. This exclusion is not just unfair; it weakens our collective ability to respond to the climate crisis. When women and girls are empowered through education, they are better able to claim their rights, challenge harmful practices, and take part in driving the shift away from fossil fuels.

The fossil fuel industry itself is built on patriarchal structures that disadvantage women economically. Women face pay gaps and barriers to entering and advancing in this sector. At the same time, they are often the ones who suffer most from rising energy costs, particularly in low-income households where women are more likely to manage daily expenses and care work.

Pollution from fossil fuels adds another layer of harm. It affects health, livelihoods, and safety, and these impacts are not felt equally. For many women, especially those already facing discrimination or poverty, pollution and environmental degradation deepen existing inequalities. This increased pressure can heighten the risk of gender-based violence, as resources become scarce and social tensions rise.

Extreme weather events driven by the climate crisis also hit women hardest. When floods, storms, or droughts strike, women often have fewer resources, less mobility, and less access to information or decision-making power. These factors combine to make them more vulnerable to displacement, loss of income, and violence in the aftermath of disasters.

Activists working at this intersection point out that women tend to support renewable energy more than men. This support reflects both the disproportionate harms they experience from fossil fuels and their commitment to safer, more sustainable alternatives. But support alone is not enough. Women need to be in leadership positions where they can shape energy policies, direct investments, and guide the transition to renewables.

To address these overlapping crises, intersectional approaches are essential. This means recognizing that women are not a single, uniform group and that factors such as race, class, disability, and geography shape how they experience the climate crisis. It also means centering the rights and experiences of those most affected when designing climate solutions.

When intersectional strategies are put into practice, they can help dismantle the patriarchal structures of the fossil fuel economy, reduce the risks of gender-based violence, and open space for women’s leadership. Ensuring girls’ education, protecting human rights, and advancing climate justice are not separate goals—they are part of the same struggle for a safer, fairer, and more sustainable world.
