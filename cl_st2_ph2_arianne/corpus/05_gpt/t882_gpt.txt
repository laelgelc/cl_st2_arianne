Greenpeace East Asia recently put 30 major cosmetic brands under the microscope after earlier investigations found microplastics in 170 types of seafood. This new research focused on microbeads—tiny pieces of plastic commonly used in exfoliating and cleansing products—that wash down drains, slip through wastewater treatment systems, and end up in rivers and oceans. Once there, they can be ingested by marine life and ultimately make their way back to our plates via the food chain.

The brands were ranked based on their public commitments to eliminate microbeads from their products. On paper, many companies appear to be responding to public concern, but the details of their pledges tell a different story. Because there is no single, strict definition of “microbead” or “microplastic” in many policies, companies can exploit loopholes. Some definitions focus only on certain types of plastic, certain sizes, or specific product categories, allowing brands to claim progress while continuing to use other forms of solid microplastics.

None of the 30 brands assessed met what Greenpeace East Asia considers a robust environmental standard. Even the highest-ranking companies fell short. Beiersdorf, for example, scored near the top for pledging to remove polyethylene microbeads, but its commitment did not extend to other plastic ingredients used in personal care products. This pattern was repeated across the sector: partial phase-outs, narrow definitions, and incomplete timelines that leave plenty of room for ongoing microplastic pollution.

The findings point to a clear conclusion: voluntary action by companies is not enough. To truly protect oceans, marine ecosystems, and human health, governments must step in with comprehensive legislation. That means banning all forms of solid microplastics in personal care and cosmetic products, not just a single polymer like polyethylene. The United States has already taken steps in this direction by introducing a ban on microbeads in certain products, demonstrating that regulatory action is both possible and effective.

While policy change is essential, people can also play a role right now. Consumers can use existing apps and ingredient guides to check products for microplastics and choose safer alternatives. By avoiding products that contain solid microplastics and supporting brands with stronger commitments, individuals can help push the cosmetics industry toward truly microplastic-free products—backed, ultimately, by strong government bans that close the loopholes for good.
