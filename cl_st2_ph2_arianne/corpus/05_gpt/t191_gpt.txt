Oceans are at the heart of our planet’s life support system. They absorb around 90% of the excess heat trapped by greenhouse gas emissions, buffering us from even more extreme global temperature rises. They also take up nearly one-third of human-caused methane and CO₂ emissions, slowing the pace of climate breakdown. On top of that, oceans produce between 50% and 80% of the oxygen in our atmosphere. Much of this comes from marine phytoplankton, including tiny organisms like Prochlorococcus, which collectively outperform even the world’s tropical forests in oxygen production.

But this vital climate shield is being weakened by human activities. Overfishing is stripping marine ecosystems of key species, disrupting food webs and undermining the resilience of ocean life. Plastic pollution is choking wildlife and contaminating waters across the globe. Offshore oil and gas extraction adds further stress, risking spills and leaks while driving the very fossil fuel use that causes global warming.

As these pressures mount, the oceans’ ability to regulate the climate is being impaired. Changes in ocean currents are already being observed, with consequences that reach far inland. Coastal communities are facing increased flood damages as sea levels rise and storm surges intensify. Scientific projections indicate that, if current trends continue, the frequency of El Niño events could double by the end of this century, amplifying extreme weather, droughts, and floods around the world.

To confront this crisis, Greenpeace is calling for strong, binding global action. Central to this is the demand for a Global Ocean Treaty capable of protecting at least 30% of the world’s oceans by 2030. Such protection would create large, fully and highly protected marine areas where industrial extraction is off-limits, giving marine life the space and time it needs to recover and thrive.

Greenpeace is also demanding a complete ban on commercial whaling, the end of seabed fossil fuel extraction, and decisive measures to stop illegal fishing and all forms of ocean contamination. These steps are essential to restore the health of marine ecosystems and to preserve the oceans’ critical role in stabilising the climate.

This work is not confined to conference halls and negotiation rooms. On the water, Greenpeace’s ship Arctic Sunrise is investigating the Argentine Sea, gathering evidence and bearing witness to what is happening in these waters. This kind of frontline documentation supports the case for stronger protections and exposes the impacts of destructive activities that too often remain out of sight.

Public support for ocean protection is growing rapidly. Nearly five million people have already signed a petition calling for strong safeguards for the oceans. Their voices send a clear message to governments and corporations: the oceans are indispensable to life on Earth, and protecting them is not optional. It is an urgent responsibility that must be met now, for the climate, for biodiversity, and for all communities who depend on a living, thriving sea.
