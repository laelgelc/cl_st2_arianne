Grassroots movements have always been at the heart of meaningful social change. From defending forests and oceans to demanding climate justice and human rights, it is people on the ground who push societies to act faster and fairer. Building on this power, Greenpeace is co-creating a series of live online Roundtable discussions with activists, scientists, and other allies to explore how we can strengthen our collective struggles.

These Roundtables focus on themes such as diversity, solidarity, and intersectionality, recognising that the climate crisis is inseparable from questions of health, inequality, and justice. The conversations are designed not as one-way presentations, but as spaces for collaboration—places where experiences are shared, strategies are exchanged, and new alliances are formed.

One panel looks at the health impacts of the climate crisis in vulnerable regions. Experts from Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) and others discuss what they are witnessing on the frontlines: how rising temperatures, extreme weather, and environmental degradation are already harming communities, and why health and climate policies must be addressed together. Their contributions underline that protecting the planet is also about protecting people’s right to live healthy, dignified lives.

Another Roundtable turns to activism in the Amazon. Panelists describe the escalating threats facing this vital region—from deforestation to violence against those who defend the forest—and the urgent need for stronger protection. They share how local and Indigenous activists are resisting these pressures, and how global solidarity can support their efforts to safeguard the Amazon as a home, a culture, and a climate lifeline.

Recognising the emotional and physical toll of long-term campaigning, a dedicated discussion addresses activist burnout and resilience. Participants explore how constant exposure to injustice, danger, and loss can wear people down, and they share strategies for caring for ourselves and each other while staying engaged. This focus on resilience is about sustaining movements for the long haul, so that those who speak out are not left to carry the burden alone.

Intergenerational activism is another core theme. One panel emphasises the power of cross-generational alliances, bringing together younger and older activists who are fighting side by side for environmental and social justice. Their stories show how different experiences and skills can complement each other, and how learning flows in all directions when generations work together.

Throughout the series, panelists highlight how interconnected our struggles are. They speak about the links between climate, health, human rights, and social inequality, and how none of these issues can be solved in isolation. The Roundtables invite everyone watching to see themselves as part of a wider network of resistance and care.

Greenpeace’s invitation is clear: these conversations are open spaces for collaboration. By joining the Roundtables, listening to those on the frontlines, and sharing your own perspectives, you become part of a collective effort to build more just, inclusive, and resilient movements—rooted in solidarity, shaped by diversity, and guided by the understanding that our fights are all connected.
