Greenpeace teams set out in May and June 2015 to some of the world’s most remote mountain regions on three different continents. These are the places people often imagine as untouched wilderness: high peaks, clean snow, and clear water far from cities and industry. Yet the snow and water samples collected there told a very different story.

Laboratory analysis of the samples revealed persistent and hazardous per- and poly-fluorinated chemicals (PFCs) in every location tested. These chemicals, used widely in industrial processes and in outdoor gear for waterproofing and stain resistance, are designed to repel water and dirt. But once released into the environment, they do not simply disappear. They degrade very slowly, they travel long distances, and they are now turning up in places that should be pristine.

PFCs are not just persistent; they are dangerous. Studies have linked them to harmful effects on reproduction, the promotion of certain tumors, and disruptions to hormone systems. Their ability to spread globally and linger for years means that exposure is not confined to the places where they are produced or used. The presence of these substances in remote mountain snow and water underscores how pervasive they have become.

There is a deep irony in the role of the outdoor industry in this contamination. Many outdoor brands rely on images of wild landscapes, clean rivers, and snow-covered peaks to sell their products. At the same time, by using PFC-based treatments in waterproof jackets, boots, tents, and other gear, they contribute to the pollution of the very environments they celebrate and depend on.

The expeditions also showed that this pollution is not inevitable. Safer PFC-free alternatives were used and tested during the journeys, and they performed well under real outdoor conditions. This demonstrates that high-performance gear does not have to come at the expense of the environment or human health.

Greenpeace is calling on outdoor brands to take responsibility and eliminate PFCs from their products. The organization is urging companies and consumers alike to join the Detox campaign, which aims to phase out hazardous chemicals such as PFCs. By choosing PFC-free gear and demanding stronger commitments from brands, outdoor enthusiasts can help protect the mountains, snow, and water they love from long-lasting chemical pollution.
