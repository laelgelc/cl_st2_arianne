Around the world’s oceans, seabirds are sounding a clear warning about the damage humans are inflicting on marine ecosystems. Among the most threatened are albatrosses, iconic ocean wanderers that can travel thousands of kilometres across the seas. Their survival is being undermined on multiple fronts, with human activities reshaping the oceans faster than these long‑lived birds can adapt.

One of the most severe pressures is industrial overfishing. By removing vast quantities of fish from the sea, industrial fleets are stripping away the prey that seabirds depend on. For albatrosses and many other species, this means longer, riskier foraging trips and less food for their chicks. Since 1950, some populations have declined by up to 70%, a stark indicator of how quickly things can unravel when the food web is destabilised.

On top of food scarcity, many seabirds are being killed directly in fishing operations. Bycatch – the unintentional capture of non‑target species – remains a major threat. Birds can become fatally entangled in lines and nets or drown when they seize baited hooks and are dragged underwater. These deaths are entirely avoidable, yet they continue at scale in many fisheries.

Plastic pollution adds another deadly layer of pressure. More than a million seabirds are killed each year by plastics, whether through ingestion or entanglement. Birds mistake floating fragments for food, filling their stomachs with material that provides no nutrition and can cause internal injuries or starvation. Others become trapped in discarded fishing gear and other debris. The sheer volume of plastic in the oceans is turning once‑rich feeding grounds into hazardous traps.

Seabirds are also vulnerable to threats on land and at sea that have built up over generations. Invasive species introduced to nesting islands – such as rats, cats, and other predators – can devastate colonies by eating eggs, chicks, and even adults. Historically, feather harvesting drove intense persecution, with birds killed in huge numbers for fashion and trade. While that particular industry has waned, its legacy lingers in depleted populations and lost breeding strongholds.

Modern industrial society has introduced new dangers as well. Seabirds collide with ships and structures at sea, and oil spills can be catastrophic, coating feathers, destroying insulation, and poisoning birds that ingest contaminated water or prey. Toxic chemicals that accumulate in marine food webs pose additional, often invisible, risks to their health and reproductive success.

Layered over all of this is the growing influence of climate change and ocean acidification. As humans burn fossil fuels, carbon dioxide emissions are not only warming the planet but also changing the chemistry of the oceans. Since the Industrial Revolution, ocean acidity has increased by about 30%. This shift makes life harder for organisms that build shells and skeletons, such as corals and shellfish. When these foundational species are harmed, the effects ripple through entire ecosystems, altering habitats and food availability for countless marine animals, including seabirds.

Studies from around the world are documenting how these overlapping pressures are disrupting marine ecosystems. Seabirds, which are highly mobile and closely tied to ocean productivity, are among the first to show the consequences. Their declines are a visible sign that the systems they depend on – and that humans rely on for food, climate regulation, and livelihoods – are under strain.

Yet there are clear pathways to help seabird populations recover and to restore healthier oceans. Expanding marine reserves can provide safe havens where industrial fishing is limited or banned, allowing prey fish populations to rebuild and reducing the risk of bycatch. Banning destructive practices such as bottom trawling in sensitive areas can protect crucial feeding and breeding habitats from being literally scraped off the seafloor. Restoration efforts, including the removal of invasive species from nesting islands and the rehabilitation of damaged habitats, can give seabirds a chance to rebound.

These actions are not just about saving individual species; they are about rebuilding the resilience of entire marine ecosystems. Seabirds are powerful indicators of ocean health. When they thrive, it is a sign that the seas are rich, balanced, and capable of sustaining life. Protecting them means confronting overfishing, plastic pollution, fossil fuel dependence, and the many other pressures we have placed on the oceans – and choosing instead to give marine life the space and time it needs to recover.
