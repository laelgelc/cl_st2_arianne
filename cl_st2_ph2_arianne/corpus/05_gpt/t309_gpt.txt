As cities open up again after years of Covid-related restrictions, we have a unique chance to rethink how we move, how we share space, and what kind of future we want to build together. This moment coincides with World Bicycle Day and World Environment Day – a powerful reminder that the way we travel is directly connected to the health of our planet and our communities.

Every journey is a choice, and every choice shapes our cities. When we choose short-haul flights or private cars for trips that could be done by train, bike, or on foot, we lock in more pollution, more noise, and more space taken up by traffic instead of people and nature. When we choose trains instead of planes for short distances, when we walk or cycle instead of driving, and when we share electric vehicles instead of owning more private cars, we help cut emissions and free up our streets for cleaner air, safer movement, and more green spaces.

#ShareTheCity is about exactly that: reclaiming our streets and public spaces so they work for everyone, not just for traffic. It’s an invitation to imagine cities where children can play safely, where parks and trees replace parking lots, and where it’s normal – and easy – to get around without owning a car. Choosing trains over short-haul flights and over car journeys where possible is one of the most effective ways to reduce climate pollution from transport. Using shared electric vehicles when we really do need a car helps cut both emissions and congestion. Reducing private car use overall creates room for wider pavements, bike lanes, public transport lanes, and urban nature.

But individual choices are only part of the picture. Governments have a responsibility to redesign our transport systems so that the sustainable option is the easiest, safest, and most affordable one. That means putting walking and cycling first, not last, in urban planning. It means investing in reliable, accessible public transport instead of expanding roads for more car traffic. It means protecting and expanding green spaces so that cities become healthier, cooler, and more resilient places to live.

Communities have a powerful role to play too. People coming together to demand car-free zones, safer cycling infrastructure, better pavements, and cleaner public transport can push local and national leaders to act. Neighborhood campaigns for slower traffic, protected bike lanes, and more trees on streets are not just about mobility – they are about the right to breathe clean air, to feel safe moving around, and to enjoy shared public spaces.

Greenpeace’s #Mobility4All vision is grounded in the idea that sustainable transport must also be fair and accessible. Everyone should be able to get to work, school, healthcare, and leisure activities without being forced into owning a car or taking a flight. Biking, walking, and rail travel are key to this. They don’t just reduce emissions; they support physical and mental health, create more opportunities for social connection, and help protect the environment we all depend on.

Choosing a bike over a car for short trips can turn a stressful commute into daily exercise. Walking more can reconnect us with our neighborhoods and with each other. Taking the train instead of flying for shorter journeys can transform travel into a chance to see the landscape we usually pass over in the sky. These everyday decisions add up – to quieter streets, cleaner air, safer routes for children and older people, and cities where nature can thrive alongside human life.

As we mark World Bicycle Day and World Environment Day, this is a moment to commit to a different kind of urban mobility – one that puts people and the planet first. By embracing walking, cycling, public transport, shared electric vehicles, and fewer private cars, we can #ShareTheCity and move towards #Mobility4All: a future where transport is sustainable, inclusive, and truly serves the common good.
