Across the world, millions of people are standing up to corporate plastic pollution and demanding real change from some of the biggest consumer brands on the planet.

More than three million supporters have joined Greenpeace in calling out companies like Nestlé and Unilever for their role in the plastic crisis. From overflowing landfills to polluted rivers and coastlines, single-use plastic packaging is fuelling a global emergency that communities and nature are forced to bear.

During a Global Week of Action, Greenpeace activists and allies brought this reality directly to Nestlé’s doorstep. Giant “plastic monsters” made from branded waste were delivered to the company’s global headquarters in Switzerland, as well as to Nestlé offices around the world. These disturbing sculptures symbolised the mountains of disposable packaging that Nestlé produces every year—packaging that too often ends up in the environment instead of being safely reused or eliminated.

The message was clear: Nestlé must dramatically reduce its plastic production and invest in reuse and refill systems instead of relying on throwaway packaging. Activists demanded that the company move beyond vague statements and commit to a clear, transparent plan with ambitious targets to help end the plastic crisis.

Unilever, another major plastic polluter, was confronted with similar actions in the Netherlands. Activists there echoed the same demands: cut single-use plastics at the source and scale up reusable, refillable alternatives that don’t depend on endless production of new plastic.

To connect what happens in corporate boardrooms with what happens on the frontlines of pollution, Greenpeace ships transported powerful symbols of plastic waste from Southeast Asia to Europe. These visual reminders highlighted how plastic packaging from global brands is impacting communities and ecosystems far from the companies’ headquarters. The journey underscored a stark reality: decisions made in Europe and elsewhere are contributing to a crisis that people in Southeast Asia and other regions are forced to live with every day.

Nestlé has publicly acknowledged that recycling alone is not enough to address the plastic problem and has pledged to cut its use of single-use plastics. But words and partial measures are not sufficient. Greenpeace is urging Nestlé to back its statements with concrete, transparent plans and time-bound, ambitious targets that match the scale of the crisis.

The growing movement of supporters, activists, and affected communities is demanding more than small tweaks to a broken system. The call is for a fundamental shift away from single-use plastics toward reuse models that protect people and the planet, and for major corporations like Nestlé and Unilever to take responsibility for the pollution their products create.
