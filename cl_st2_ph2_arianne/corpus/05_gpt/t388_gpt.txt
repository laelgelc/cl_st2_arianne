In the remote Kamchatka peninsula in Russia, something went terribly wrong along one of the country’s most beautiful coastlines. Locals first noticed that the seawater had changed color. It carried an unpleasant, chemical-like smell. Surfers who entered the water reported sore throats, eye irritation, and nausea. Soon after, the ocean began to wash up its dead.

Thousands of benthic organisms—animals living on or in the seabed—appeared along the shore. The scale of destruction was shocking: around 95% of seabed life in the affected area was wiped out, including near a UNESCO World Heritage site. What had been a rich, living marine ecosystem was suddenly a graveyard.

Greenpeace Russia quickly began an on-the-ground investigation. Activists and experts took water and soil samples, deployed drones to survey the coastline from the air, and consulted independent specialists to understand what could have caused such a drastic die-off. The exact source of the disaster remains unknown. Possible explanations include natural causes, such as toxic algal blooms, or human causes, such as illegal or poorly managed waste dumping.

Because the cause is still unclear, Greenpeace Russia is demanding an independent, transparent investigation. Only a thorough, unbiased probe can determine what happened, hold those responsible to account if human activity is involved, and prevent similar catastrophes in the future.

This disaster is not an isolated incident. It is another sign of Russia’s deep environmental problems and the risks posed by a fossil fuel–dependent, polluting economic model. Greenpeace Russia has pointed to other major environmental crises, such as the massive oil spill in Norilsk, as evidence that the current system is failing people and nature alike.

In response, Greenpeace is calling for a green economic transformation in Russia—one that shifts the country away from fossil fuels and hazardous industrial practices, and towards renewable energy and policies that put the health of people and ecosystems first. Protecting the oceans, safeguarding communities, and preventing the next Kamchatka or Norilsk disaster means rethinking how energy is produced, how waste is managed, and whose interests economic decisions really serve.

The images from Kamchatka—discolored seas, empty seabeds, and coastlines littered with dead marine life—are a stark warning. Without systemic change, such scenes risk becoming more common. With a just transition to clean energy and strong environmental protections, they do not have to be our future.
