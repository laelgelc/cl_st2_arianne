Israel’s recent announcement that it will eliminate coal and oil use by 2030 marks a major turning point in the country’s energy story. Energy Minister Yuval Steinitz has outlined a plan that shifts Israel away from the most polluting fuels and toward electric vehicles, gas-powered trucks, and electricity produced from natural gas and renewable sources.

This shift did not happen in a vacuum. For years, Greenpeace Israel has campaigned against coal power plants in Hadera and Ashkelon, drawing attention to the heavy price they exact on people and the planet. These plants have been associated with serious health impacts, including premature deaths, as well as significant financial costs and climate damage due to their greenhouse gas emissions.

When authorities considered installing scrubbers to reduce pollution from these plants, Greenpeace Israel argued that this would only prolong the life of coal instead of addressing its root harms. Rather than accepting technological fixes that keep coal burning, the organization pushed for full shutdowns of the polluting units.

This pressure helped secure important commitments: the closure of the old coal units by 2022 and an end to coal imports. These steps are critical milestones on the way to phasing coal out of Israel’s energy mix and reducing the country’s contribution to the climate crisis.

Yet Greenpeace Israel’s vision goes far beyond replacing coal with gas. The organization continues to advocate for a transition to 100% renewable energy, with a strong emphasis on solar power. In a country with abundant sunshine, solar is seen as a key tool for meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement and for safeguarding the health, climate, and well-being of future generations.

The phase-out of coal and oil by 2030, the closure of the Hadera and Ashkelon units, and the end of coal imports are all crucial steps. But for Greenpeace Israel, they are part of a larger journey: moving Israel toward a fully renewable energy system that protects people, the climate, and the environment on which all life depends.
