Every two years, government delegates and NGOs gather for the International Whaling Commission (IWC) meeting, and this year in Brazil the stakes could not be higher for the world’s whales.

The debate at the heart of the meeting is deeply polarized. Pro‑whaling nations are working to undermine the global ban on commercial whaling – a ban that has been vital for allowing many whale populations a chance to recover. This push comes in the shadow of recent controversy over Iceland’s killing of hybrid blue whales, a stark reminder that even today some of the largest and most vulnerable creatures on the planet are still at risk.

Two competing visions for the future of the IWC are on the table. Japan’s “Way Forward” proposal aims to legitimize commercial whaling, reshaping the IWC back into a body that would permit the very industry that once drove many whale species to the brink. In sharp contrast, Brazil’s “Florianopolis Declaration” puts conservation at the centre, emphasizing the role whales play in healthy oceans and seeking to orient the IWC firmly toward protecting them rather than hunting them.

Another crucial issue is the proposed South Atlantic Whale Sanctuary. This sanctuary would create a safe haven for whales in a vast region of ocean, but it faces determined political resistance from countries that still support whaling or oppose new conservation measures within the IWC.

Greenpeace experts are in Brazil to defend the hard‑won global ban on commercial whaling, to support the creation of the South Atlantic Whale Sanctuary, and to press for an IWC whose future is defined by conservation and recognition of whales’ importance to ocean ecosystems. The decisions made at this meeting will shape whether the IWC moves backwards toward commercial exploitation or forward toward lasting protection for whales and the seas they call home.
