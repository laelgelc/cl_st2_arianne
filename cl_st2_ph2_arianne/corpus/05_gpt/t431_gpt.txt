The oil spill at Russia’s Nornickel plant in Taimyr, Siberia has stained the land and water in one of the Arctic’s most remote regions, turning the Ambarnaya River red and drawing comparisons with some of the worst industrial disasters in recent history. For local Indigenous communities, this catastrophe is not an isolated accident but part of a long, painful pattern of pollution and neglect.

In an interview, Indigenous leader Grigory Dyukarev describes how Nornickel’s operations have shaped life in the region for decades. He points to a long history of pollution from the company’s facilities, which has damaged ecosystems that local people depend on for their survival. The spill is just the latest, and most visible, blow to a way of life already under pressure.

Dyukarev explains that the oil spill has devastated fishing and hunting, the backbone of local economies and culture. Contaminated rivers and lands mean fewer fish, fewer animals, and growing uncertainty about how families will feed themselves and earn a living. What the outside world sees as an environmental disaster is also a social and economic crisis for Indigenous peoples whose livelihoods are tied to healthy land and water.

He also highlights Nornickel’s social irresponsibility, recalling how the company abandoned a newly built settlement instead of developing it as promised. For communities that had hoped for stable housing and basic services, this was another betrayal, reinforcing a sense that corporate interests come first and local people last.

On top of industrial pollution, Dyukarev describes the accelerating impacts of climate change in Taimyr. Winters are getting warmer, and the once-frozen soil is beginning to thaw. These changes are altering wildlife patterns and the conditions for fishing and hunting, compounding the damage from spills and other industrial activities. The combination of climate disruption and pollution is making traditional ways of life increasingly fragile.

He calls for a comprehensive support program for affected communities, including environmental monitoring, restoration of damaged ecosystems, and fair compensation for losses. Dyukarev stresses the need for stricter legislation to protect the Arctic, so that companies operating there are held to much higher standards and cannot simply walk away from the harm they cause.

The disaster at the Nornickel plant is not an isolated event. Dyukarev notes that spills continue to occur in remote areas, often far from public attention. These incidents disproportionately affect Indigenous communities, who bear the brunt of environmental damage while having the least power to prevent it or demand justice. For them, the red-stained waters of the Ambarnaya River are a visible symbol of a deeper, ongoing crisis that demands urgent action.
