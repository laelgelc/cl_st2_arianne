Transport in Europe is heading in the wrong direction. The sector is responsible for over a quarter of the EU’s greenhouse gas emissions, and instead of shrinking, these emissions have risen by 28% since 1990. At a time when every fraction of a degree of warming matters, this trajectory is not just unsustainable – it is unacceptable.

After the COVID-19 crisis, European governments had a historic opportunity to reshape transport in a fairer, cleaner way. Instead, many chose to pour public money into some of the most polluting parts of the system: carmakers and airlines. These investments prop up a model that puts private cars and frequent flying at the centre of mobility, reinforcing individualism and profit over collective wellbeing, public health and climate safety.

This is not inevitable. It is the result of political choices – and it can be changed by making different ones.

Stopping the expansion of the most polluting infrastructure is a crucial first step. That means ending public investments in new airports and highway projects that lock us into decades more emissions. Continuing to expand runways and road networks while claiming to be serious about climate action is a clear contradiction.

At the same time, governments must stop giving tax privileges to the problem they claim to be solving. Tax breaks for cars encourage more driving, more congestion and more pollution. Removing these advantages is essential if cleaner alternatives are to thrive. Short‑haul flights where there is a reasonable rail alternative should be banned altogether, instead of being treated as a normal, everyday option. Flying a few hundred kilometres when a train can do the job is a luxury the climate cannot afford.

A different future is possible if public money is redirected towards solutions that work for both people and the planet. That means major investment in affordable, reliable trains so that rail becomes the obvious choice for most journeys. It means building safe, connected cycling networks and expanding high‑quality public transport, so that walking, cycling and shared mobility are convenient and accessible to everyone, not just those who already live in well‑served city centres.

Ending the sale of new combustion engine and hybrid cars by 2028 is another key measure. Every new fossil‑fuelled vehicle sold today is a long‑term commitment to future emissions. Setting a clear and ambitious end date sends a signal to industry, investors and consumers that the age of the combustion engine is over, and that cleaner options must rapidly become the norm.

None of this can happen fairly without supporting the people whose jobs and livelihoods depend on today’s polluting transport system. Workers in car manufacturing, aviation and related sectors need policies that guarantee training, income security and pathways into good, sustainable jobs. A serious plan for decarbonising transport by 2040 must put these workers at its centre, ensuring that the transition is just, not punitive.

Public pressure is essential to push governments in this direction. Individuals can take concrete steps: contacting political representatives to demand an end to airport and highway expansion, stronger support for trains, cycling and public transport, and a rapid phase‑out of fossil‑fuel vehicles; and tracking their own transport emissions to better understand where changes are possible in daily life. Personal choices alone will not solve the crisis, but they can reinforce collective demands and show that people are ready for a fair, clean transport system.

Europe’s transport emissions did not grow by accident, and they will not fall by accident either. Redirecting money, infrastructure and political will away from cars and planes and towards trains, bikes and public transport is not just a climate necessity – it is a chance to build a more liveable, equitable society for everyone.
