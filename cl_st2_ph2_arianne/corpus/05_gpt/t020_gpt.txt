Around the world, powerful corporations are increasingly turning to the courts to try to silence those who speak up for the environment. These cases, known as SLAPPs – Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation – are not about seeking justice. They are about intimidation: meritless lawsuits designed to drain time, money, and energy from environmental defenders, journalists, and communities so they are too exhausted or afraid to continue their work.

Recent reports have documented 355 SLAPP cases globally since 2015, with the majority taking place in the Global South. This pattern is no accident. Corporations often target people and organizations in regions where legal protections are weaker, resources are scarcer, and the risks of speaking out can be higher. Fossil fuel companies in particular have been aggressive users of this tactic, targeting more than 150 entities that have challenged their projects, exposed their pollution, or questioned their role in driving the climate crisis.

These lawsuits usually share common features: sky-high damage claims, vague or exaggerated accusations, and legal arguments that stretch credibility. The goal is not to win on the merits, but to send a message to everyone watching: if you challenge us, we will make you pay. Even when these cases are eventually thrown out, they can tie up defendants for years, forcing them to divert funds from frontline work into legal defense and causing stress and uncertainty for those involved.

In response, a growing anti-SLAPP movement is pushing back. In the United States, a federal anti-SLAPP bill has been proposed to better protect people who speak out on matters of public interest. In the European Union, a directive has been put forward to curb cross-border SLAPPs and provide safeguards for those targeted. These efforts aim to prevent the abuse of the legal system and to ensure that the courts cannot be weaponized against public participation.

Greenpeace is part of this pushback. To support others facing similar attacks, Greenpeace has developed and shared an anti-SLAPP toolkit. This resource emphasizes three key strategies: raising awareness so that communities and decision-makers understand what SLAPPs are and how they work; raising funds to ensure that those targeted have the legal and practical support they need; and raising voices to show solidarity and make it clear that when one group is attacked, many others will stand with them.

There are signs that this resistance is working. A recent $100 million lawsuit against Greenpeace was dismissed by the court, a major victory not only for Greenpeace but for everyone who believes in the right to speak out on environmental and climate issues. This dismissal sends an important signal to other would-be SLAPP filers: using the courts to bully critics is not a guaranteed path to success.

Yet the threat remains. SLAPPs are a direct attack on free speech and public participation. They aim to silence criticism, hide wrongdoing, and shut communities out of decisions that affect their land, water, climate, and future. Defending against SLAPPs is therefore not just a legal battle; it is a struggle to protect the democratic space in which people can organize, protest, investigate, and demand accountability.

As long as corporations continue to deploy these tactics, environmental defenders will need strong protections and broad support. By exposing SLAPPs, strengthening laws against them, and standing together with those who are targeted, we can ensure that the voices calling for climate justice and environmental protection are not silenced, but amplified.
