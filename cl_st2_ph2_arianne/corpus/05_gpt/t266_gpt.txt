To have any chance of avoiding climate disaster and keeping global heating to 1.5°C in line with the Paris Agreement, the way we produce and consume food must change fundamentally. Food systems are not a side issue in the climate crisis: farming alone is responsible for around one-quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions. Within that, livestock production is a major driver, accounting for 14.5% of global emissions and around half of all methane emissions.

These numbers matter because methane is a powerful greenhouse gas, and industrial livestock systems are at the heart of how our food system is driving the climate emergency. Yet instead of addressing this directly, many high-level political processes continue to promote the illusion that we can tweak the current model at the margins and still meet climate goals.

The UN Food Systems Summit (UNFSS) has become a symbol of this failure. Rather than centring the people who are already feeding communities sustainably—smallholder farmers, Indigenous Peoples, and local food producers—the process has been dominated by corporate interests. This corporate capture shapes which solutions are considered “realistic” or “innovative,” and which are sidelined.

Instead of confronting the need to reduce industrial livestock production, the agenda has leaned towards industry-friendly fixes. These include technocratic and genetic solutions such as genetically modified chickens, which allow agribusiness to continue expanding intensive meat production while claiming to be addressing climate and sustainability concerns. Such approaches avoid the core issue: the scale of meat and dairy production and consumption.

Greenpeace’s work shows that a meaningful climate-safe pathway requires a substantial reduction in meat and dairy. According to Greenpeace’s report, global meat and dairy production and consumption must be reduced by 50% by 2050 to stay within planetary boundaries and give the world a chance of meeting the 1.5°C target. This is not a marginal dietary shift; it is a structural transformation of food systems away from industrial livestock and towards plant-rich, ecologically produced food.

Transforming food systems in this way is not just about emissions numbers. Expanding the livestock industry along its current trajectory drives deforestation as forests are cleared for pasture and animal feed, deepens health crises linked to diets high in industrially produced meat and dairy, and exacerbates social and economic inequities. Communities living in and around forests, small-scale producers, and Indigenous Peoples bear the brunt of land grabs, pollution, and loss of livelihoods, while large corporations consolidate power and profit.

A different path is both possible and necessary. It starts with amplifying local voices and putting smallholder farmers, Indigenous communities, and other frontline food producers at the centre of decision-making. These are the people whose knowledge and practices already embody ecological approaches—diverse cropping systems, agroecology, and community-based management of land and water—that can nourish people while protecting ecosystems and the climate.

Embracing ecological systems means moving away from the industrial model that treats animals, land, and workers as inputs to be exploited. It means reshaping policies, subsidies, and public investment to support diversified, low-input, climate-resilient farming and to make healthy, plant-rich food accessible and affordable. It also means protecting the rights of communities to land, seeds, and territories, rather than allowing corporate control to extend further into every part of the food chain.

Central to this transformation is resisting the ongoing expansion of the livestock lobby. Powerful meat and dairy interests are pushing hard to lock in their business model, from influencing trade rules and agricultural subsidies to shaping global forums like the UNFSS. If they succeed, the world will be pushed further down a path of deforestation, biodiversity loss, public health problems, and deepening inequality—while closing the window on the 1.5°C goal.

A climate-safe, fair, and healthy food future depends on confronting this power and choosing a different direction. Cutting global meat and dairy production and consumption by half by 2050, as Greenpeace’s report calls for, must become a central pillar of climate and food policy. That shift must go hand in hand with elevating the leadership of local communities and Indigenous Peoples and scaling up ecological farming systems that work with nature, not against it.

Transforming food systems is not optional if we are serious about avoiding climate disaster. It is one of the most powerful levers we have to protect forests, safeguard public health, reduce inequality, and keep the promise of the Paris Agreement alive.
