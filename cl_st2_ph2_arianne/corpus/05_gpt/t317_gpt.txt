The recent approval of the Climate Change and Energy Transition Law in the Spanish Congress marks a step forward, but it is far from the leap needed in the face of the climate emergency.

The law introduces several measures that can help push the country in a more sustainable direction. It recognises the role of public procurement in reducing emissions, opening the door for public contracts to favour low‑carbon goods and services. It also acknowledges how our diets affect sustainability, and it includes provisions on climate finance reporting, aiming to shed more light on where money is flowing and how it affects the climate. In addition, the law sets a minimum percentage of the national budget that must be dedicated to climate action, and it supports practical measures such as the creation of low‑emission zones and the promotion of energy renovation in buildings.

However, these advances are overshadowed by the law’s lack of ambition. The emissions reduction target—only a 23% cut by 2030—is clearly insufficient in the context of the climate emergency and the science‑based need for deeper, faster reductions. The law also falls short on essential structural reforms. There is no robust taxation reform to align the fiscal system with climate goals, leaving powerful incentives for polluting activities largely intact.

Equally worrying is the absence of a clear, decisive plan to phase out fossil fuels. Without a firm commitment and timetable to leave coal, oil and gas behind, Spain risks locking in high‑carbon infrastructure and missing the opportunity to lead in clean energy. The law also fails to include bans on fossil fuel advertising or on certain short‑haul flights where rail or other lower‑emission alternatives exist—measures that would send a strong signal about the direction of travel for transport and consumption.

From Greenpeace’s perspective, the result is a watered‑down law that does not match the urgency of the climate crisis. The inclusion of low‑emission zones, energy renovation measures and climate‑related budget requirements shows that progress is possible, but these steps must be part of a much more ambitious framework.

What is needed now is the political will to strengthen this law: to raise emissions reduction targets, commit to a fair and rapid fossil fuel phase‑out, reform taxation so that it rewards climate‑friendly choices, and adopt bolder measures on advertising and short‑haul flights. Only with stronger commitments and clear timelines can Spain ensure a fair ecological transition that protects people, the climate and the environment.
