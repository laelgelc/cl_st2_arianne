Fossil fuel companies are working hard to present themselves as friends of culture, sport, and education – even as their core business drives the climate crisis. Through sponsorships, partnerships, and influence in public institutions, they deploy soft power to greenwash their reputations and delay the transition away from oil and gas.

From rugby pitches to art galleries, fossil fuel branding is everywhere. Companies like Ineos and Total have attached their names to major rugby events, wrapping a high-carbon business model in the positive emotions people feel for their teams. These sponsorships are not neutral: they help normalize fossil fuel companies as benevolent partners instead of major contributors to climate breakdown.

In the cultural sector, this strategy can be even more insidious. Shell has funded museum exhibitions under conditions that reportedly included clauses preventing criticism of the company. When a fossil fuel corporation bankrolls public culture on the condition that it cannot be challenged, it is not just buying goodwill – it is shaping what can and cannot be said about its role in the climate crisis. ExxonMobil has similarly supported arts institutions while maintaining a history of denying or undermining climate science. This contrast between public image and corporate reality is at the heart of fossil fuel greenwashing.

The same pattern appears in education. Total has exerted influence at École Polytechnique, one of France’s most prestigious engineering schools, helping to frame the energy conversation for future decision-makers. Across different countries, school programs sponsored by oil companies present themselves as educational support while subtly reinforcing a continued role for fossil fuels. When the industry gets to shape curricula, competitions, or campus priorities, it can lock in narratives that justify extending the life of its climate-damaging business model.

Sport is another powerful arena for this soft power. Gazprom’s high-profile partnership with UEFA has put a fossil fuel giant at the heart of European football. These deals tie the excitement, pride, and unity of major sporting events to the brand of a company whose profits depend on continued fossil fuel extraction and consumption. Fans are left cheering under banners that help sanitize the industry’s image.

All of these efforts – in culture, sport, and education – serve a common purpose: to buy social license, delay regulation, and distract from the urgent need to phase out fossil fuels. As public awareness of the climate crisis grows, so does scrutiny of these relationships. Many institutions, artists, athletes, and academics are questioning whether they can accept money that comes with such a heavy climate cost.

There are clear signs that the tide is turning. Divestment from fossil fuels is growing as investors, universities, and public funds move their money away from coal, oil, and gas. Younger generations in particular are increasingly unwilling to tie their futures to companies whose business models are incompatible with a safe climate. This youth reluctance undermines the social foundations the industry is trying to shore up through sponsorships and branding.

Ending fossil fuel advertising and sponsorships is a logical and necessary step to accelerate the green transition. Just as tobacco advertising was restricted when the harm became undeniable, fossil fuel promotion must no longer be allowed to masquerade as philanthropy or cultural support. Removing this soft power will not, by itself, solve the climate crisis – but it will help clear the public space of misleading narratives, making it easier for societies to confront the reality of the industry’s impact and to move faster toward clean, just, and sustainable energy systems.
