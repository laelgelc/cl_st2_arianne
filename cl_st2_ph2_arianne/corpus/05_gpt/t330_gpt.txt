Thirty-five years after the Chernobyl disaster, its consequences are still unfolding, yet governments and corporations continue to build and operate nuclear power plants. New projects include reactors in Belarus and Russia’s floating plant, the “Akademik Lomonosov,” which has been dubbed a “floating Chernobyl.” At the same time, more than 30 countries continue to rely on nuclear energy.

The legacy of Chernobyl shows why this path is so dangerous. There is still no technology capable of safely dealing with the reactor’s radioactive fuel. The massive confinement structure completed in 2016 – often described as a new sarcophagus – has only bought time, not solved the underlying problem. It is a temporary measure placed over a permanent threat.

Around five million people in contaminated areas of Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia continue to live with ongoing radiation exposure. The disaster is not confined to history books; it is a daily reality for those who remain in affected regions, where contamination persists in the environment and food chain.

Climate change is making this situation even more precarious. In 2020, the exclusion zone around Chernobyl saw its largest forest fires to date, driven by increasingly extreme climate conditions. These fires did not just threaten ecosystems; they also raised serious risks for firefighters working in contaminated areas and potentially for populations downwind. A planned study, supported by Greenpeace, will assess the radiation doses firefighters were exposed to during these fires, helping to better understand and document the dangers.

This combination of unresolved nuclear waste, long-term contamination, and growing climate-driven risks demonstrates why continuing to build and operate nuclear power plants is unacceptable. Instead of locking societies into new nuclear hazards, governments must phase out nuclear energy and rapidly scale up renewable energy solutions. Renewable energy offers a path to meet climate goals without creating new radioactive legacies for future generations.
