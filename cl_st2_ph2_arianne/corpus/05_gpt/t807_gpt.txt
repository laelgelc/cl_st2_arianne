The Marine Stewardship Council’s decision to certify an Antarctic krill fishery as sustainable is deeply troubling. This stamp of approval has been granted despite clear objections from groups such as the Pew Environment Group and the Antarctic and Southern Ocean Coalition, and it risks legitimizing the industrial exploitation of a species that underpins the entire Southern Ocean ecosystem.

Three critical issues have been sidelined in the rush to call this fishery “sustainable.”

First, krill are already highly vulnerable to climate change and ocean acidification. These tiny crustaceans are at the mercy of rapidly changing conditions in Antarctic waters, yet this growing environmental stress has not been adequately accounted for in the certification process. Treating krill as a stable, exploitable resource ignores the reality that their habitat is being transformed by warming seas and increasing acidity.

Second, the expansion of krill fishing into ever more remote parts of the Southern Ocean is inherently unsustainable. This push into previously less-disturbed areas is not a sign of a carefully managed fishery; it is a warning sign that industrial operations are extending their footprint into some of the planet’s last relatively untouched marine regions. Calling this expansion “sustainable” sends exactly the wrong signal at a time when precaution and restraint are urgently needed.

Third, our knowledge of krill’s life history remains limited. We still do not fully understand their population dynamics, reproduction, and long-term responses to environmental change. Certifying a fishery as sustainable when the basic biology and ecology of the target species are not well understood is a gamble with consequences that could reverberate throughout the food web.

Krill are a foundational food source for whales, seals, penguins, and many fish species. By certifying this fishery, the Marine Stewardship Council is helping to normalize and expand the exploitation of a keystone species that countless other animals depend on for survival. The potential for serious ecosystem harm is clear: reducing krill availability can undermine the entire Southern Ocean food chain.

Adding to the concern is the fact that krill are not even being harvested primarily to feed people directly. Instead, they are processed into products like krill oil and fish food. In other words, we are putting the stability of Antarctic ecosystems at risk to supply industrial products and supplements, rather than meeting essential human nutritional needs.

By overlooking the vulnerability of krill to climate change, the unsustainable expansion of fishing into remote waters, and the gaps in our knowledge of krill biology, the Marine Stewardship Council’s certification sends a dangerous message. It suggests that exploiting a critical, climate-stressed species at the base of the Antarctic food web is compatible with sustainability. It is not.
