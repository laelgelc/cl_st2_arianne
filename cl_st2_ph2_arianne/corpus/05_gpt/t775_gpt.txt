Industrial meat and dairy production is harming our environment on a massive scale. Forests are being destroyed to make way for animal feed and grazing, water sources are polluted by manure and fertilisers, and oceans are suffering from expanding dead zones where almost nothing can live. The climate impact is enormous: emissions from industrial meat and dairy are comparable to those from all global transportation combined.

This system doesn’t just damage the planet; it also harms our health. High meat consumption is linked to serious health issues including cancer, heart disease, obesity and diabetes. In contrast, shifting towards plant-based diets could save millions of lives, easing pressure on healthcare systems while reducing environmental destruction.

Greenpeace imagines a future where children proudly see themselves as part of “Team Plant” — a generation that embraces plant-based eating as a way to protect the world they will inherit. This vision is not about individual responsibility alone; it demands bold action from governments.

Public policies must support ecological farming instead of industrial mega-farms, and prioritise food systems that work with nature rather than against it. Schools can play a powerful role by serving more plant-based foods, helping children develop healthier and more sustainable eating habits from an early age. Reducing the dominance of mega-farms and supporting ecological alternatives can help restore ecosystems, protect water and soil, and lower climate emissions.

Everyone has a part to play in transforming the food system. By reducing personal meat consumption and choosing more plant-based options, people can join a growing global movement that demands better from governments and industry. Together, we can build a food system that nourishes people, protects forests and oceans, stabilises the climate, and offers children a healthier future on a thriving planet.
