The latest IPCC report on climate change impacts, adaptation, and vulnerability confirms that climate change is already causing widespread losses to both nature and people. It shows that risks are escalating faster and at lower levels of warming than previously understood, meaning the window to prevent the worst impacts is rapidly closing.

The report finds that current adaptation efforts are not keeping pace with the growing dangers. People in the most vulnerable countries are facing far higher mortality from climate-related disasters, despite having contributed the least to the crisis. This inequality underscores the urgent need for stronger support, protection, and resources for communities on the frontlines.

Limiting global heating to 1.5°C remains critical to reduce damages and avoid triggering more dangerous and irreversible impacts. Every fraction of a degree matters. Staying as close as possible to 1.5°C will significantly reduce the number of people exposed to climate risks and the scale of losses in ecosystems and economies.

The report stresses that conserving between 30% and 50% of Earth’s land, freshwater, and ocean areas is essential to maintain healthy ecosystems that can support life and help buffer us from climate impacts. Protecting and restoring nature is not a “nice to have” — it is a core part of climate resilience and survival.

At the same time, the report is clear that current models of development are unsustainable. Pursuing endless growth based on fossil fuels and overexploitation of nature is driving us deeper into crisis. Urgent, systemic transitions in energy, food, transport, cities, and how we use land and oceans are needed to secure a livable future.

This means rapidly phasing out fossil fuels and ending new coal, oil, and gas expansion. It means supporting a strong Global Ocean Treaty to protect marine life and safeguard the high seas. It means defending biodiversity on land and at sea, and recognizing and upholding the rights of Indigenous Peoples, whose knowledge and stewardship are vital for protecting ecosystems.

The IPCC’s message is unambiguous: we still have choices, but they are narrowing. Governments, corporations, and financial institutions must act now to cut emissions, protect nature, and scale up adaptation, especially for the most vulnerable. People everywhere can help push for these changes — by demanding a fossil fuel phase-out, supporting ocean and biodiversity protection, and standing with Indigenous communities and others on the frontlines of the climate crisis.

The future we get will be the one we fight for today.
