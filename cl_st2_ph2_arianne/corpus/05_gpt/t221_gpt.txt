Awa Traore looks back on COP26 with a deep sense of contradiction: a moment that was supposed to mark global climate progress instead laid bare how profit-driven interests continue to shape our collective future. In her reflection, she points to the corporations and political leaders who, in the name of growth and competitiveness, are driving ecosystem destruction and threatening Indigenous lands. Their decisions, she notes, are not abstract—they translate into dispossession, poisoned territories, and communities pushed further to the margins.

She argues that any honest climate response must confront the economic system at its core. For Awa, that means the Global North recognizing how exploitative capitalism has built its wealth on extraction—from land, from people, and from the atmosphere. It also means rejecting the idea that the Global South should be reduced to a dumping ground for carbon offset schemes that allow polluters to continue business as usual. Instead, she calls on governments in the Global South to prioritize people’s lives, rights, and livelihoods over markets in carbon credits that often deepen inequality and environmental harm.

Despite her anger and disappointment, Awa insists that hope is not only possible but visible. It lies in people power: in Indigenous activists defending their territories and knowledge, and in young people who refuse to be silent while their futures are negotiated away. These movements are not asking for minor tweaks; they are confronting leaders with demands for climate justice that are inseparable from economic and racial justice. Their courage, she suggests, is a counterweight to the cynicism and short-termism dominating official talks.

For Awa, COP26 did not deliver what was needed. Governments failed to agree on a pathway to genuinely limit global heating to 1.5°C. They failed to meet the long-promised $100 billion a year in climate finance. They failed to establish proper funding for loss and damage—support for communities already facing the irreversible impacts of a crisis they did not cause. Instead, what emerged was a push for carbon trading mechanisms that she sees as unfair and dangerous, particularly for countries and communities in the Global South who are already living with the consequences of climate breakdown.

This is why she believes the response cannot be resignation. The failures of COP26 are, in her view, a call to intensify resistance—to organize more boldly, build stronger alliances, and insist that future climate talks, including COP27, center people and the planet rather than corporate profit. Awa’s reflection is both a warning and an invitation: a warning about what happens when power remains in the hands of those who benefit from the status quo, and an invitation to stand with the communities and movements already fighting for a livable, just future.
