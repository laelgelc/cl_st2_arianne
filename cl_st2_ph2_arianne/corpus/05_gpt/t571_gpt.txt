June has just broken the record as the hottest month ever measured – and July is set to follow the same path. Across the world, people are already living through what those records actually mean: searing, relentless heat that is reshaping daily life and putting lives at risk.

In Europe, temperatures have climbed to extremes once considered unthinkable. In France, the thermometer has reached up to 45.6°C, disrupting communities and straining health systems and infrastructure. In India, temperatures have pushed beyond 50°C, causing deaths and sparking fears that some regions could become uninhabitable in the future if the climate crisis continues unchecked.

These are not isolated anomalies; they are part of a rapidly warming world. By 2050, 75% of cities are expected to face a shifted climate, meaning the typical weather they experience will resemble today’s conditions in entirely different – often hotter and drier – regions. Heat exposure is projected to rise dramatically, increasing health risks, undermining livelihoods, and intensifying inequality as the most vulnerable are hit first and hardest.

Despite this, many European leaders continue to delay the transition away from fossil fuels, citing short-term economic concerns. Yet moving rapidly to net zero emissions is not only a climate imperative; it is a massive opportunity. A fast, fair transition can create new jobs, deliver substantial health benefits by cutting air pollution, and save trillions in avoided climate damages and health costs. The costs of inaction are already visible in every heatwave, crop failure, and overburdened hospital ward.

Fossil fuels remain at the heart of the problem. Coal alone is responsible for 46% of global CO2 emissions, driving the temperature rise that is making heatwaves more frequent, more intense, and more deadly. Every delay in phasing out coal and other fossil fuels locks in more warming and more suffering, especially for those least responsible for the crisis.

Around the world, people are refusing to accept this path. Mass movements and local campaigns are pushing back against fossil fuel expansion and demanding real climate action. Protests have helped protect places like Hambach Forest in Germany from coal mining, showing how determined, sustained resistance can force change. The Fridays for Future school strikes have brought millions of young people into the streets, insisting that their right to a livable future must come before the profits of polluting industries.

Greenpeace’s Unite for Climate tour across Europe is part of this growing wave of action. The tour is traveling from community to community, exposing the political and corporate barriers that still stand in the way of a just energy transition. It is connecting people and movements who are resisting fossil fuels, and amplifying the voices of those already living with the impacts of a heating world. By bringing together local struggles and shared solutions, the tour highlights both the urgency of the crisis and the power of collective action to confront it.

As record-breaking heat becomes the new reality, the choice could not be clearer. Continuing to rely on coal and other fossil fuels will deepen the crisis and push more regions toward unlivable conditions. Choosing a rapid, just transition to net zero emissions can protect people from escalating heat, create decent jobs, improve public health, and save trillions in costs we can no longer afford to pay.
