Greenpeace activists from climate-hit countries took action against Shell by occupying a ship transporting equipment for the company’s Penguins oil and gas field in the North Sea. The action, which became Greenpeace’s longest protest on a moving platform, lasted 13 days, from January 31 to February 12.

The activists targeted Shell at a moment when the company was reporting record profits of $39.9 billion. They drew a direct link between these profits and the worsening climate crisis, pointing to the devastation already being felt around the world, including severe floods in Pakistan. Their message was clear: while communities suffer from climate impacts, fossil fuel companies continue to expand projects that drive further damage.

The Penguins oil and gas project was a central focus of the protest. Activists highlighted that the project is expected to emit 45 million tonnes of CO2, adding significantly to the greenhouse gas emissions heating the planet. From the moving ship, they demanded that Shell stop drilling for more fossil fuels and pay for the destruction caused by its operations and emissions.

Shell responded by seeking a court order against the activists and claiming $120,000 in damages. Nevertheless, more activists joined the protest during the journey. The action concluded in Norway, where Greenpeace ended the occupation by unfurling a banner, closing a nearly two-week-long protest that put a spotlight on Shell’s role in the climate crisis and the call for accountability.
