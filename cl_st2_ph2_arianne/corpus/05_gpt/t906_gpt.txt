Out in the vastness of the Indian Ocean, where the horizon seems to stretch forever, Greenpeace’s ship Esperanza has been hard at work tracking down and removing deadly drifting traps: Fish Aggregating Devices, or FADs.

These floating structures are deployed by reckless fishing vessels that supply seafood giant Thai Union. Designed to attract marine life, FADs don’t just bring in the tuna the industry is after. They also lure sharks, turtles, juvenile fish and countless other species into the path of industrial fishing gear. The result is a hidden tide of bycatch deaths that never make it onto any label or into any corporate sustainability report.

The Esperanza is using its reach and advanced technology to change that. From the deck, campaigners scan the sea with powerful binoculars, searching for the tell-tale shapes and signals of FADs scattered across the open ocean. Above, solar-powered UAVs sweep wider areas, extending human eyesight far beyond the ship’s immediate surroundings. Below the surface, an underwater ROV helps locate submerged components and assess what’s happening out of view.

With this combination of tools, the crew has been able to track down and retrieve dozens of FADs from the Indian Ocean. Every device removed is one less floating death trap for marine life, one less unmonitored piece of industrial fishing gear drifting through shared waters.

But the work doesn’t end when a FAD is hauled on board. Instead of letting the plastic, metal and electronic components become more waste, Greenpeace is finding ways to put them to positive use. Some materials are returned to local artisanal fishers, who rely on small-scale, low-impact methods to support their communities. Other parts are repurposed into solar-powered lamps and chargers, providing practical tools that can help meet everyday needs without adding to the problem.

By physically removing these devices from the ocean and transforming their components, Greenpeace is directly challenging Thai Union’s destructive practices at sea. Each FAD lifted from the water is a concrete reminder that industrial fishing companies must be held accountable for the full impact of their supply chains.

The work on the Esperanza is just one front in this effort. As the ship continues its mission on the water, further actions are being prepared on land to confront Thai Union and push for real, lasting change in how our oceans are treated.
