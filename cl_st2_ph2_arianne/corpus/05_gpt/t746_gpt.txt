Rosatom’s Akademik Lomonosov, the world’s first floating nuclear power plant, is now being towed to the Arctic to power fossil fuel extraction – locking in more climate-wrecking oil and gas instead of accelerating a just transition to renewable energy. Mounting a nuclear reactor on a barge and sending it into some of the harshest waters on Earth is a high‑risk gamble with the Arctic environment and the communities and wildlife that depend on it.

The risks begin with the basic design: a nuclear power plant at sea. A serious incident could trigger seawater explosions or hydrogen blasts, with the potential to release radioactive materials directly into the ocean. In the confined, icy waters of the Arctic, this would threaten marine wildlife and fish stocks, contaminating food chains and livelihoods. The region’s unique conditions – extreme cold, drifting sea ice, and prolonged darkness – would only make any emergency response more difficult and hazardous.

These are not abstract fears. Nuclear incidents on submarines and icebreakers in the past show that nuclear reactors at sea can and do suffer accidents. The plan to develop additional floating nuclear units and fleets would multiply these risks, putting more reactors into vulnerable marine environments and increasing the chances of collisions, technical failures, or other emergencies.

Nuclear waste management on the Akademik Lomonosov raises further concerns. Radioactive waste will be stored onboard for years, without secure land-based disposal in place. Keeping spent fuel and other nuclear waste at sea for extended periods means that any accident, structural failure, or extreme weather event could have far‑reaching consequences, with no safe buffer between the waste and the marine environment.

The lack of independent oversight over this project is deeply troubling. Without robust, transparent monitoring and regulation, there is no credible guarantee that safety standards are being met, that risks are being minimized, or that the public will be informed promptly and fully if something goes wrong. Decisions with potentially global environmental consequences are being taken behind closed doors.

On top of that, the plant is inherently vulnerable to the very forces that shape the Arctic. Tsunamis, powerful cyclones, collisions with other vessels or ice, flooding, sinking, or grounding all pose serious threats. Any of these scenarios could damage the reactor or its cooling systems, or compromise onboard waste storage, leading to leaks of radiation into the surrounding waters.

Deploying a floating nuclear power plant in the Arctic to fuel more fossil fuel extraction combines two dangerous paths: deepening dependence on oil and gas, and expanding nuclear risks into fragile marine ecosystems. Instead of protecting the Arctic, this project exposes it to an array of avoidable dangers that could leave a lasting radioactive legacy in one of the world’s most important and vulnerable regions.
