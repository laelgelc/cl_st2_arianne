Air pollution is one of the biggest threats to public health today, cutting lives short and worsening diseases from asthma to heart conditions. Recognising the scale of the crisis, the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2021 tightened its air quality guideline for fine particulate matter (PM2.5) to just 5 micrograms per cubic metre (µg/m3) annually. This much stricter benchmark reflects the mounting scientific evidence that there is no safe level of exposure to dirty air – and it underlines how far most countries still have to go.

Across Asia and beyond, people are refusing to accept toxic air as the price of “development”. Communities, activists and organisations are pushing governments and companies to act, and Greenpeace is part of that growing movement. From Malaysia to Turkey, Indonesia to Thailand, campaigns are challenging polluters, demanding stronger standards, and showing that clean air is a basic human right.

In Malaysia, recurring transboundary haze has become a symbol of how air pollution ignores borders. Greenpeace advocacy against the haze crisis helped elevate the issue from an environmental nuisance to a matter of rights and accountability. This work contributed to a human rights complaint that framed clean air as fundamental to people’s dignity and safety. A roundtable brought together key stakeholders to confront the causes and impacts of the haze, while viral art interventions carried the message far beyond policy circles. By turning public spaces and social media feeds into platforms for protest, these creative actions helped transform frustration into organised pressure for change.

In Turkey, the struggle for clean air is unfolding in a country still heavily dependent on fossil fuels. Coal, in particular, remains a major part of the energy mix, with serious consequences for people’s health. Air pollution there is linked to an estimated 30,000 premature deaths every year, a stark reminder of the human cost of delay and inaction. Working with other non-governmental organisations, Greenpeace has supported efforts that have succeeded in shutting down coal plants, cutting off major sources of harmful emissions. At the same time, campaigners are pushing the government to bring national air quality standards into line with WHO recommendations. Aligning with these guidelines would be a crucial step towards preventing thousands of avoidable deaths and illnesses.

In Indonesia’s capital, Jakarta, the fight for clean air has played out in the courts. Residents, supported by civil society, filed a lawsuit against public officials for failing to protect people from dangerous air pollution. The case argued that authorities had not done enough to safeguard the health of millions living and working in the city’s smog. In 2021, the court issued a landmark verdict ordering officials to improve air quality. This legal victory affirmed that governments can be held responsible when they neglect their duty to ensure breathable air. Subsequent appeals have continued the legal and political battle, but the ruling itself stands as a powerful precedent and a source of inspiration for communities facing similar struggles elsewhere.

In Thailand, citizens and activists have been pushing for stronger protections against PM2.5 pollution, which regularly spikes to hazardous levels. Petitions and a lawsuit pressed the government to recognise the severity of the crisis and to adopt tougher standards. In 2023, these efforts helped drive a revision of the national PM2.5 standard to 37.5 µg/m3 for daily exposure. While still far above the WHO guideline, this change marks a concrete policy shift that can be built on, and it shows that sustained public pressure can move governments to act.

These stories from Malaysia, Turkey, Indonesia and Thailand share a common thread: when people come together to demand clean air, they can change laws, close polluting plants, and force powerful institutions to respond. Air pollution may be a global problem, but it is being challenged city by city, courtroom by courtroom, and community by community.

As the WHO’s strengthened guideline makes clear, the world cannot afford to treat dirty air as inevitable. Every step towards stricter standards, greater transparency and reduced fossil fuel dependence is a step towards healthier, safer lives. The experiences across these countries show that citizen unity is not just desirable – it is essential for winning the right to breathe clean air.
