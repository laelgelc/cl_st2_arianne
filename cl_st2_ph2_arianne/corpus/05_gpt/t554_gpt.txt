Toru Anzai remembers the simple act of gathering bamboo shoots in his village in Fukushima as something that once defined his life and connection to the land. Before the 2011 nuclear disaster, this seasonal routine was part of a broader rhythm shared by the community of Iitate. Today, that life has been shattered. The village that once had 6,300 residents now has only about 900 people, most of them elderly returnees living with the long shadow of radiation.

For Anzai, the disaster has not just been a story of evacuation and return, but of ongoing physical suffering. He describes skin pain, hair loss, headaches, strokes, and heart attacks, which he believes are linked to the “black snow” fallout that followed the nuclear accident. These experiences have left him feeling both physically weakened and emotionally exhausted, haunted by what happened and what continues to unfold.

Greenpeace research shows that radiation exposure in the area still exceeds safety standards. While some decontamination has been carried out, it is impossible to fully decontaminate forested areas, which cover much of the surrounding landscape. These forests remain a persistent source of radioactive contamination, undermining the idea that life in the village can simply return to normal. The environment that once sustained people—fields, forests, and the bamboo groves Anzai used to visit—now carries invisible risks that cannot be easily removed.

Despite this, the government has pushed policies that encourage people to return. Housing subsidies for evacuees have been ended, putting financial pressure on those who remain displaced and making return seem like the only option for some. At the same time, there are plans to release over a million tonnes of radioactive water into the ocean, a move that raises further concerns about spreading contamination and worsening pollution beyond Fukushima’s borders.

For Anzai, these policies deepen a sense of abandonment. He feels that the suffering of residents like him has been ignored, and that their health, livelihoods, and dignity have been sacrificed to a narrative of recovery that does not match the reality on the ground. The loss of his home, the ongoing radiation, his health problems, and the pressure to accept policies he believes are dangerous all feed into a profound anger.

The bamboo shoots he once gathered symbolised a life intertwined with the land and seasons. Now, that memory stands in stark contrast to a present marked by displacement, contamination, and a struggle to be heard.
