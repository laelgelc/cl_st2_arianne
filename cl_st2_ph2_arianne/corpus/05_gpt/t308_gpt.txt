Net zero has become the buzzword of climate politics and corporate PR, but behind the glossy pledges lies a dangerous illusion. These commitments often rest on the assumption that emissions released in one place can simply be “balanced” by removing carbon somewhere else. This framing hides the hard truth: we live on a finite planet, with limited land, ecosystems already under immense pressure, and a carbon budget that is rapidly running out.

Many net zero strategies depend heavily on land-based carbon removals, especially reforestation and other nature-based solutions. But there is only so much land available, and it is already home to Indigenous Peoples, local communities, biodiversity, and food production. Treating land as a limitless sink for pollution from fossil fuels erases these realities. It also ignores the fundamental difference between fossil carbon, locked underground for millions of years, and carbon temporarily stored in trees or soils. Once fossil carbon is burned, it is effectively permanent on human timescales; a forest can burn, be logged, or die back under climate stress.

Cheap carbon credits have turned this flawed logic into a profitable business model. Companies can buy low-cost offsets instead of cutting their own emissions, while marketing themselves as climate leaders. This allows business-as-usual to continue, with the heaviest polluters often doing the least to change. Meanwhile, the impacts of land-based offset projects are frequently pushed onto marginalized communities, who may face land grabs, restricted access to forests, or new forms of surveillance and control. The result is a deeply unjust system where those least responsible for the climate crisis bear new burdens in the name of “net zero.”

To confront the climate emergency honestly, we need to move beyond these deceptive pledges. That means setting clear, separate, and transparent targets instead of folding everything into a single net zero number. First, there must be rapid, absolute reductions in fossil fuel and industrial emissions, not delayed cuts masked by offsets. Second, we need dedicated targets for land-use impacts, including deforestation and the climate footprint of meat and dairy production, which are major drivers of ecosystem destruction and emissions. Third, there must be explicit, rights-based goals for protecting nature, centering the rights and knowledge of Indigenous Peoples and local communities rather than treating ecosystems as carbon warehouses.

Relying on speculative or unproven technologies such as carbon capture and storage to justify continued fossil fuel use only deepens the risk. Every year of delay brings us closer to climate tipping points that could trigger irreversible changes. The priority has to be immediate and steep cuts in fossil fuel use, not betting the future on technological promises that may never materialize at scale or in time.

Avoiding climate breakdown requires a collective effort that spans governments, communities, workers, scientists, and social movements. It means challenging the narratives that allow polluters to rebrand themselves as climate champions while continuing to extract and burn coal, oil, and gas. Real climate action is not about clever accounting; it is about transforming the systems that drive emissions in the first place. By focusing on rapid fossil fuel phase-out, just and sustainable land use, and rights-based protection of nature, we can replace hollow net zero promises with the real change this moment demands.
