Japan’s plan to discharge more than 1.2 million tons of Fukushima Daiichi wastewater into the Pacific Ocean from 2023 marks a stark departure from global efforts to prevent the dumping of nuclear waste at sea. This move runs counter to the spirit and purpose of international agreements such as the London Convention and its Protocol, which were developed to protect the marine environment from exactly this kind of pollution.

The contrast with Japan’s own past actions is striking. In 1993, when Russia planned to dump nuclear waste into the Sea of Japan, Japan stood firmly against it. At that time, Japan supported a global ban on the dumping of nuclear waste at sea and even financed facilities in Russia to manage nuclear waste on land. These steps were taken in the context of strong international pressure and campaigning by Greenpeace, which helped secure a broader commitment to end nuclear dumping in the oceans.

Today, however, Japan is pursuing a course that undermines those hard-won protections. At a recent meeting of the International Maritime Organization (IMO), Greenpeace presented alternative options to ocean discharge, including extended storage and the use of advanced processing technologies to manage the contaminated water on land. These options were put forward to avoid the long-term and potentially irreversible impacts of releasing radioactive water into the marine environment.

Instead of engaging with these proposals, Japan — supported by the United States, France, and the United Kingdom — blocked efforts even to open a formal discussion on the issue within the IMO framework. This obstruction came despite calls from other countries, including South Korea and several Pacific Island nations, which pushed for a thorough review of the discharge plan and its implications for regional marine ecosystems and communities.

The support of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) for Japan’s discharge plan has further emboldened the Japanese government, despite ongoing concerns about whether all legal obligations under international law and environmental agreements are being respected. The stance taken by Japan and its allies sidelines the voices of neighboring states and Pacific peoples, whose livelihoods, cultures, and food security are closely tied to a healthy ocean.

By pressing ahead with ocean discharge, Japan is disregarding the very principles it once championed: precaution, environmental protection, and international cooperation to keep nuclear waste out of the sea. This shift not only threatens the Pacific but also weakens global norms designed to safeguard our shared oceans from radioactive pollution.
