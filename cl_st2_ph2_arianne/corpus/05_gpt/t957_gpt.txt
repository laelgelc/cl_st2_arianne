The deck of the Polar Pioneer heaves beneath my feet as the Pacific swells roll past, and I can feel every knot of tension in my body. I’m about to scale an oil rig to stand in the way of Shell’s plans to drill in the Arctic, and I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t scared. The height, the cold, the constant motion of the sea – none of it feels natural or comfortable. My hands are already sweating just thinking about the climb.

But the discomfort I feel out here is nothing compared to what’s at stake.

Shell’s Arctic drilling threatens so much of what we depend on every single day: clean air to breathe, stable weather we can plan our lives around, beaches that aren’t slick with oil, and – most importantly – a habitable future for the generations coming after us. When I picture children growing up in a world shaped by the consequences of reckless fossil fuel expansion, the fear I have of this rig shrinks to almost nothing.

I’m not doing this alone. I’m here with five teammates, each of us carrying our own fears and doubts, each of us choosing to push past them. And we’re not just six people on a rig in the middle of the ocean – we’re backed by more than 6 million supporters who refuse to accept that corporate greed gets to decide the fate of the Arctic, the climate, or our shared future.

Every one of those supporters has their own obstacles: jobs, families, worries, and limitations. But what unites us is a simple determination not to look away and not to give up. That determination is stronger than any one company’s profit motive.

I’m climbing this rig because I believe that when millions of us act together, we can stop Shell from drilling and show that no corporation is too powerful to be challenged. I’m asking you to stand with me, with my five teammates, and with the millions who have already joined. Whatever fears or barriers you face, your voice and your action matter.

Out here on the Pacific, the wind is sharp and the rig looms above me. I’m scared, but I’m ready. I know that together, we can halt this drilling and defend the air we breathe, the weather we rely on, the beaches we love, and the livable world every new generation deserves.
