Across Canada, caribou are slipping toward extinction while governments cling to decisions that belong in the past. Instead of confronting the real drivers of decline—industrial habitat destruction and weak protection laws—authorities are choosing quick fixes that sidestep their legal and moral responsibilities.

In Quebec, the fate of the Val-d’Or caribou herd illustrates this failure. Rather than securing and restoring the habitat these animals need to survive, the provincial government is moving the remaining animals to a zoo. This is not recovery—it is surrender. It abandons the commitments laid out in recovery plans and ignores the intent of the federal Species at Risk Act (SARA), which is supposed to prevent exactly this kind of collapse. Relocating caribou to captivity does nothing to address the logging, road-building and other industrial pressures that destroyed their range in the first place.

On the other side of the country, British Columbia is following a similarly misguided path. There, the government continues to cull wolves in an attempt to slow caribou declines. Killing predators targets the symptoms, not the cause. The core problem is habitat loss and fragmentation driven by poor forest management. As long as critical caribou habitat continues to be degraded, no amount of wolf culling will secure the long‑term survival of these herds. It is a strategy designed to buy time on paper while avoiding the hard choices needed to rein in destructive development.

These decisions are especially indefensible given what is already known. Under SARA, recovery strategies and scientific studies have clearly identified the risks facing caribou and the habitat thresholds needed for their survival. Yet, despite these plans and repeated warnings, governments have taken little meaningful action on the ground. The gap between what the science says and what decision-makers are willing to do grows wider each year, and caribou are paying the price.

There is a different path. Applying existing science and Indigenous knowledge must become the starting point for every decision affecting caribou habitat. Indigenous communities have stewarded these lands and species for generations and must be central to defining and enforcing protection measures. Stronger habitat protection—designed and implemented with First Nations at the table from the outset—is essential if caribou are to have any future outside of zoos and museum displays.

Public pressure is crucial to force this shift. People across Canada can help push governments to stop delaying and start implementing the recovery strategies that already exist. Signing petitions that call for real habitat protection and for the safeguarding of boreal forests sends a clear message: symbolic gestures and lethal “band-aid” measures like wolf culls are no substitute for serious, science-based action.

Caribou do not have time for outdated, ineffective policies. The tools, knowledge and legal frameworks are already in place. What is missing is the political will to use them. By standing with Indigenous communities, demanding strong habitat protection, and supporting petitions that call for full implementation of recovery plans, the public can help ensure that caribou remain a living part of Canada’s boreal forests—not a relic of what we failed to protect.
