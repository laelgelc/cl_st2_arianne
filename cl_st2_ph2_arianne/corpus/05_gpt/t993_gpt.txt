Mattel’s latest Barbie may come in a lab coat, a hard hat, or a ball gown—but right now, her most troubling “career” is one she never asked for: Rainforest Destroyer.

Greenpeace is calling out Mattel for using packaging linked to the destruction of Indonesia’s rainforests. The forests being cleared are home to incredible biodiversity and play a vital role in stabilising our climate. Yet, instead of protecting them, parts of the toy industry’s supply chain are helping drive their destruction.

Investigations have connected Mattel’s packaging to Asia Pulp and Paper (APP), a company with a long record of rainforest clearance in Indonesia. And Mattel is not alone. Similar problems have been found in the supply chains of other major brands, including Hasbro, Disney, and Lego. When toy companies buy from suppliers tied to deforestation, the real cost of a “fun” purchase is paid by forest communities, wildlife, and the climate.

That’s why Greenpeace is demanding that Mattel and other toy companies:

- Publicly commit to suspend all purchases from Asia Pulp and Paper until it can prove it has stopped destroying rainforests.
- Adopt strong, transparent, and enforceable sustainable procurement policies to ensure their products and packaging are not linked to deforestation.

To ramp up the pressure, Greenpeace is using one of the world’s most recognisable toys to tell the story. Barbie’s new satirical “career” as Rainforest Destroyer is a way to expose what’s hidden behind glossy boxes and plastic windows.

Supporters are being asked to take action in several ways:

- Send a clear message to Mattel demanding that the company cut ties with Asia Pulp and Paper and clean up its packaging supply chain.
- Share a revealing video that exposes the rainforest destruction behind toy packaging, helping spread the word beyond the usual environmental circles.
- Use social media to call out Mattel and other toy companies, amplifying the demand for deforestation-free products.
- Join a creative contest to design Barbie’s “Rainforest Destroyer” look, with a prize on offer for the winning entry.

By speaking out, sharing the video, engaging online, and taking part in the contest, people can help push Mattel, Hasbro, Disney, Lego, and the rest of the industry to stop driving rainforest destruction and commit to truly sustainable packaging.
