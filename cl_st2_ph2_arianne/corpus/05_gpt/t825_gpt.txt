Around the world, people have been standing together for forests—and for the right to speak out when those forests are under threat.

When Resolute Forest Products sued Greenpeace and Stand.Earth for advocating the protection of the boreal forest, it wasn’t just an attack on two organizations. It was an attempt to silence critics and stifle free speech about one of the planet’s most important ecosystems. The response was global. In more than 25 countries, people gathered around iconic trees and forests to say clearly: speaking up for nature is not a crime.

In Indonesia, people came together around the Kenari Babi tree. In Lebanon, they stood with a 3,000-year-old cedar. In Germany, they rallied in beech forests. Each gathering was different, rooted in local landscapes and cultures, but all carried the same message of solidarity with the boreal forest and with those defending it.

These actions are about much more than individual trees. Forests are living systems that hold together a vast “web of life.” They are home to countless species and are essential for biodiversity. They are also powerful carbon stores, playing a crucial role in limiting global warming to under 2°C. When forests are degraded or destroyed, the impacts ripple through ecosystems, communities, and the climate.

The global movement that has formed in response to Resolute’s lawsuit is a reminder that people everywhere understand this connection. From ancient cedars to towering beeches to the vast boreal forest, our fates are intertwined with the health of forests. Defending them means defending life, climate stability, and the freedom to speak the truth about what is happening to our planet.

This is why solidarity is so important—not only in the streets and forests, but in every sector that shapes public opinion and culture. Book publishers have a powerful voice and a responsibility to stand on the side of forests and free expression, not with those trying to silence criticism.
