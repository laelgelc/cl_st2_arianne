Around the world, activists are calling out the financial institutions that continue to bankroll the climate crisis. Greenpeace is highlighting protests targeting Mitsubishi UFJ, a major bank that is still funding new coal projects even as it promotes its investments in renewable energy. This contradiction reflects a wider problem: while some money is flowing into clean energy, vast sums are still propping up fossil fuels.

Many people don’t realise that their own money may be part of the problem. Bank accounts, pension funds, and insurance policies are often invested through complex and opaque financial systems. This lack of transparency makes it hard to know whether our savings are supporting coal, oil, and gas expansion—or helping to build a safer, low-carbon future.

At the same time, the economic case for a clean energy transition is stronger than ever. Moving toward a low-carbon economy represents an estimated $89 trillion in opportunities. Clean energy is increasingly outperforming fossil fuels, showing that shifting investments is not just an environmental necessity but also a smart financial choice.

Yet the scale of ongoing fossil fuel support remains huge. Around $5 trillion is still tied up in fossil fuels. This is money that could instead be driving the rapid build-out of renewable energy, energy efficiency, and resilient infrastructure. The good news is that momentum is building: 884 institutions, together worth $6 trillion, have already committed to divest from coal. These decisions are helping to accelerate the shift away from the most polluting fuels and make space for a clean energy transition.

People are pushing for change from inside the financial system as well. There is growing interest in sustainable indexes and other tools that help investors avoid fossil fuel exposure and back climate-friendly solutions. Shareholder activism is on the rise, as more people use their rights as owners to demand that companies and financial institutions align their practices with a low-carbon future.

Demands for transparency are growing louder. Communities, customers, and investors want to know where their money is going and what it is supporting. Greenpeace stands with activists worldwide who are exposing greenwashing, challenging fossil fuel finance, and pressing for honest, accountable investment practices that match the urgency of the climate crisis.

Everyone can play a part by scrutinising their own financial footprint, asking questions of their banks, pension funds, and insurers, and pushing for options that support a rapid and just transition to clean energy. As more institutions divest from coal and other fossil fuels, and more people move their money into sustainable alternatives, the pressure will continue to rise on those still clinging to the old, polluting model.
