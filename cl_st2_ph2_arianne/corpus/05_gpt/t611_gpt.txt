Every year, Indigenous Peoples from across Brazil travel to Brasília for the Free Land Camp. They come together to share knowledge, strengthen their communities, and demand that the government respect and protect their rights. These are not new demands: Brazil’s constitution recognizes Indigenous Peoples’ rights to their traditional lands, and they have defended those territories for generations.

This year, however, the gathering carries a bittersweet tone. Under President Bolsonaro’s administration, key environmental protections have been weakened. Instead of shielding Indigenous communities, the government has failed to protect them from escalating violence, threats, and land invasions driven by powerful industries. At the same time, proposals are being pushed to halt the recognition of Indigenous lands altogether, opening the way for mining, logging, and large-scale agriculture to expand into these territories.

The consequences reach far beyond any single community or region. Deforestation in Brazil has been rising again since 2012, with the forest being cleared at the staggering rate of two soccer fields every minute. This destruction is wiping out livelihoods, tearing apart cultures, and undermining the very systems that keep the climate stable. As forests fall, the climate crisis deepens, feeding extreme weather such as more intense hurricanes and heat waves.

Indigenous territories are the most effective barrier against this destruction. Where Indigenous rights are respected and their lands are protected, the forests stand. Where their rights are denied and their territories are opened to exploitation, deforestation surges. The people gathering at the Free Land Camp are not only defending their homes; they are on the frontlines of the fight to protect the Amazon and stabilize the global climate.

Their struggle has sparked solidarity around the world. Activists have gathered outside Brazilian embassies with banners, music, and speeches, calling on governments and the public to stand with the forest guardians. These global actions echo the message from Brasília: defending Indigenous rights is essential to saving the Amazon and confronting the climate emergency.

The call is clear. Indigenous Peoples in Brazil are doing everything they can to safeguard their territories and the forests all of us depend on. They should not have to stand alone against powerful interests and a government that is rolling back protections. Join the movement to support them—amplify their voices, stand in solidarity at home and in the streets, and help defend the rights and lands that protect the Amazon and our shared future.
