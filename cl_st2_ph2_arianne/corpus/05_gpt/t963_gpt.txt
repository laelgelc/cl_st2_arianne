Forests are often described as the lungs of the planet, but they are just as crucial to its beating heart: the global water cycle that sustains agriculture and food production. A major scientific review has pulled together mounting evidence that tropical deforestation is not only a climate and biodiversity crisis—it is also a direct threat to our ability to grow food, both locally and thousands of kilometres away.

Tropical forests help regulate temperature and rainfall through a process known as evapotranspiration. Trees draw water from the soil and release it into the atmosphere, adding moisture that helps form clouds and rain, while also cooling the air. When forests are cleared, this natural air-conditioning and moisture pump is switched off. The result is drier, hotter conditions that undermine farming.

The review highlights that these impacts are not confined to the areas where trees are cut down. Because forests are deeply embedded in atmospheric circulation, losing them can alter rainfall patterns across continents and even in distant regions.

In the Amazon, for example, deforestation is projected to drive a 25% drop in soy yields. This is not simply because of local warming, but because the loss of forest reduces the moisture available to form rainfall, making conditions less favourable for crops that depend on consistent water supply.

The consequences extend far beyond South America. The review points to evidence that clearing forests in the Amazon or Central Africa can reduce rainfall in the US Midwest, a key global breadbasket. When vast forest areas no longer release moisture into the atmosphere, the air masses that travel across the globe carry less water, and regions downwind receive less rain. This means that decisions about land use in tropical regions can affect harvests on entirely different continents.

In West Africa, the stakes are similarly high. The review finds that extensive loss of the Congo Basin forests could intensify the West African monsoon while simultaneously driving temperature increases of 2–4°C and cutting rainfall by up to 50% in some areas. For farmers already facing climate stress, such a combination of heat and drying could be devastating, shrinking growing seasons, damaging yields and making food supplies more precarious.

Taken together, these findings reinforce that tropical forests are not a luxury or a distant concern: they are fundamental infrastructure for a stable climate and reliable food production. Avoiding deforestation and restoring degraded forests are therefore critical not only for protecting biodiversity and storing carbon, but also for safeguarding food security in a rapidly warming world.

Protecting forests means protecting the conditions that make farming possible—cooler temperatures, stable rainfall and resilient ecosystems. As this review makes clear, losing tropical forests puts all of that at risk.
