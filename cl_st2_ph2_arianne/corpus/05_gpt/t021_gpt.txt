In Brasília, thousands of Indigenous Peoples are once again coming together to make a clear and urgent demand: recognition of their lands. From April 24–28, the 19th Free Land Camp brings communities from across Brazil’s biomes to the country’s capital to defend a right that is already guaranteed in the constitution but still denied in practice to many territories.

Demarcation of Indigenous lands is not a symbolic gesture. It is a concrete legal process that secures territorial boundaries and ensures that Indigenous Peoples can remain on and care for their ancestral lands. This recognition shields territories from invasions and is essential for safeguarding livelihoods, cultures, and the forests that sustain them. Yet, despite its constitutional status, demarcation remains incomplete and delayed on a massive scale.

Out of 1,393 Indigenous lands claimed, only 30.8% have been fully recognized by the Brazilian state. That means 871 territories are still awaiting concrete action. Behind each of these numbers are communities facing ongoing threats and uncertainty because their lands are not properly protected.

The consequences of this failure are visible on the ground. Invasions by loggers and miners—especially illegal gold miners using heavy machinery like excavators—are tearing through Indigenous territories. Regions such as Yanomami, Kayapó, and Munduruku have been particularly hard hit. Forests are destroyed, rivers and soils are contaminated with mercury, and violence against Indigenous communities increases as invaders push deeper into their territories.

These invasions do not only harm Indigenous Peoples; they also undermine global efforts to protect biodiversity and stabilize the climate. Indigenous land protection is directly connected to the health of forests and ecosystems, which in turn play a vital role in maintaining climate balance worldwide. When Indigenous territories are defended and demarcated, forests stand, species survive, and the planet benefits.

The Free Land Camp in Brasília is therefore not only a national mobilization, but part of a broader struggle for a livable future. By demanding the full demarcation and protection of all Indigenous lands, the peoples gathered there are defending their rights, their cultures, and the forests that are crucial to the world’s biodiversity and climate.
