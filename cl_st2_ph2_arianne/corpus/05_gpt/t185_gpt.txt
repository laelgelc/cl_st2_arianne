Women and gender non-conforming people are on the frontlines of the climate crisis, yet are too often pushed to the margins of environmental decision-making. Their work is crucial: defending forests and oceans, challenging fossil fuels, confronting plastic pollution, and insisting that climate justice must include justice for disabled, Indigenous, and trans communities. Centering their leadership is not a matter of representation alone—it is essential to building effective and fair climate solutions.

A key barrier to this is eco-ableism: environmental narratives and policies that ignore, exclude, or even harm disabled people. When climate and environmental work is designed without disabled communities in mind—whether through inaccessible public actions, one-size-fits-all “green” policies, or ignoring the needs of those most affected by extreme weather—it creates deep distrust. Disabled communities are not just vulnerable to climate impacts; they are also experts in navigating systems that often fail them. Overcoming eco-ableism means actively shifting practices and priorities so that disabled people are fully included in climate action, from planning to leadership.

Around the world, women and gender non-conforming activists are already showing what inclusive, community-rooted climate action looks like.

Archana Soreng works to protect forests and uplift Indigenous knowledge, demonstrating how traditional practices and lived experience can guide more sustainable and just environmental policies. Her work highlights that Indigenous peoples are not simply “stakeholders” but rights-holders and guardians of ecosystems, and that their knowledge is central to climate solutions.

In South Korea, Eunbin Kang is part of a youth movement resisting coal. By confronting coal power and the political forces that sustain it, Eunbin and fellow young activists are challenging a fossil fuel system that drives both climate breakdown and local pollution, and insisting that young people have a say in the energy future they will inherit.

In the Philippines, Hasminah D. Paudac-Tawano is using the law to hold polluters to account. Legal battles are a powerful tool for communities facing environmental harm, and her work illustrates how litigation and legal advocacy can confront corporations and institutions that profit from pollution and environmental destruction.

Liu Junyan focuses on climate risks and inequality, emphasizing that climate change does not affect everyone equally. By drawing attention to who is most exposed to climate impacts and who has the least resources to respond, Liu’s work underlines that climate policy must tackle structural inequality if it is to be truly effective and just.

Pua Lay Peng is fighting plastic waste, confronting one of the most visible and pervasive forms of pollution. Her efforts show how tackling plastic—from production to disposal—is not only about cleaning up trash, but also about protecting communities, ecosystems, and future generations from toxic and long-lasting impacts.

Lawyer Sylvia Wu works on climate litigation and fishery rights, connecting the dots between climate change, ocean health, and the livelihoods of coastal and fishing communities. Her work reinforces that climate justice includes defending the rights of those who depend directly on the sea, and that legal strategies can be a powerful way to protect both people and marine ecosystems.

Community organizer Veronica Cabe demonstrates how local organizing can transform climate and environmental struggles. By bringing people together, building collective power, and amplifying community voices, she shows that climate action rooted in local realities is both more democratic and more resilient.

Yaewon Hwang’s work on trans justice makes clear that climate justice is inseparable from gender justice. Trans and gender non-conforming people often face heightened discrimination and risk in times of crisis, from displacement to access to services. Centering trans justice in climate work challenges exclusionary approaches and insists that safety, dignity, and rights for all genders are non-negotiable in a just transition.

Ai Ji focuses on biodiversity threats, reminding us that the climate crisis and the biodiversity crisis are deeply intertwined. The loss of species and ecosystems not only accelerates climate breakdown, it also undermines the resilience of communities who depend on healthy forests, oceans, and landscapes.

Across these diverse struggles—Indigenous forest protection, anti-coal resistance, legal fights against polluters, challenges to climate inequality, campaigns against plastic, defense of fisheries, grassroots organizing, trans justice, and biodiversity protection—runs a common thread: the leadership of women and gender non-conforming people, and the demand for climate action that is inclusive, rights-based, and intersectional.

To move forward, environmental movements must confront eco-ableism, dismantle barriers that exclude disabled people, and actively create space for the leadership of those most affected by the climate crisis. Listening to and supporting activists like Archana Soreng, Eunbin Kang, Hasminah D. Paudac-Tawano, Liu Junyan, Pua Lay Peng, Sylvia Wu, Veronica Cabe, Yaewon Hwang, and Ai Ji is not optional—it is fundamental to building the just, livable future that climate action is supposed to deliver.
