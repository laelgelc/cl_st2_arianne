The 2020 Greenpeace film festival brings together 15 free documentaries that shine a light on some of the most urgent environmental issues of our time. Available in both English and French, the festival invites viewers not just to watch, but to participate directly by serving as the jury and voting for the People’s Choice Award.

Across the selection, the films tackle a wide spectrum of themes: climate change, food and agriculture, overconsumption, biodiversity, whistleblowers, and fossil energies. Each documentary focuses on a different frontline of environmental struggle, highlighting both the scale of the crises and the people and places affected.

Some films take viewers deep into threatened ecosystems. One explores the destruction of forests in Borneo, while another follows efforts to rewild European landscapes. Others look at the impacts of global trade and industry, including the environmental consequences of sea freight and the role of industrial agriculture, with calls and ideas for reforming the system.

Several documentaries focus on iconic and vulnerable regions: saving the Amazon, preserving the oceans, and protecting endangered forests in France. Others examine how environmental breakdown intersects with social justice and human rights. Stories include climate refugees from Kiribati, Indigenous resistance to oil projects in New Zealand, and climate fights in the United States.

The festival also highlights how environmental issues cut across everyday life and local realities. Films explore rural challenges in France, plastic pollution washing up on Basque beaches, and the links between eggs, food systems, and African migration. One documentary focuses on daily actions for biodiversity, showing how individual and community choices can make a difference.

By bringing together these diverse perspectives and struggles, the 2020 Greenpeace film festival offers an accessible way for people to learn more about the planetary crises we face and the movements working to address them. Through free access and audience voting, it turns film watching into a collective act of engagement and solidarity.
