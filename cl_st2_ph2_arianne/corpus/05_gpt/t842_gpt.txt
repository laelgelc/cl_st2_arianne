The oceans are the cradle of all life on Earth. They shape our climate, feed billions of people, and produce much of the oxygen we breathe. For the past 60 years, they have also been our biggest, silent ally against climate breakdown, absorbing 90% of the excess heat caused by greenhouse gas emissions. Without this immense buffering power, scientists estimate the planet would have heated by a catastrophic 36°C. Instead of the world we know, we would be facing an unrecognizable, likely uninhabitable Earth.

But this generosity has come at a cost. Our oceans are under immense strain. Industrial fishing is stripping marine life from the seas, disrupting food webs and damaging fragile habitats. Pollution—from plastics to chemicals—further degrades ocean health, weakening the very systems that regulate our climate and sustain life.

To turn this around, we need bold, urgent action. One of the most effective tools we have is the creation of ocean sanctuaries: large, fully protected areas at sea where industrial activities like fishing and mining are off-limits. These sanctuaries give marine life the space to recover, allowing fish populations to rebuild and ecosystems to regain their natural resilience. Healthy oceans are better able to store carbon, regulate weather patterns, and support the communities that depend on them.

At the same time, none of this will be enough if we don’t tackle the root cause of ocean warming: greenhouse gas emissions. Cutting emissions rapidly and dramatically is essential to ease the pressure on the seas, stabilize the climate, and protect the life-support systems we all rely on.

Right now, at UN negotiations, there is a crucial opportunity to secure a strong global treaty to protect biodiversity in the high seas—the vast waters beyond national borders that make up nearly half the planet’s surface. Such a treaty would make it possible to create a connected network of ocean sanctuaries across these international waters, giving marine life the protection it desperately needs and helping rebuild the resilience of our oceans as a whole.

Everyone has a role to play in this moment. You can help build momentum for ocean protection by sharing your own images and stories of the sea. Post your photos of the ocean on social media using the hashtag #HighSeas to show your support for a strong global ocean treaty and a thriving, living ocean for generations to come.
