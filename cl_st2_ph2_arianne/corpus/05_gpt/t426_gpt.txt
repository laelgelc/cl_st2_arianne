One year after the shocking Amazon fires captured the world’s attention, the destruction of the forest and the threats to Indigenous Peoples have not stopped. In fact, 2020 is shaping up to be potentially even more devastating for the Amazon.

Recent aerial images taken by Greenpeace Brazil over the state of Mato Grosso show fires still burning across the landscape, even though a government ban on burning is officially in place. These images lay bare how ineffective that ban has been in practice. Last year, more than a million hectares of forest were burned, and in June this year, fire hotspots reached record levels. Rather than slowing, the crisis is deepening.

This ongoing devastation is not an accident. Under President Bolsonaro, environmental protections have been systematically dismantled, opening the door to unchecked deforestation, often to clear land for pastures. The Amazon, one of the world’s most vital ecosystems, is being sacrificed for short-term profit. This accelerates the climate crisis, drives catastrophic biodiversity loss, and destroys the homes and territories of Indigenous Peoples.

For Indigenous communities, the situation is especially grave. They face the combined threats of land invasions, fires, and the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 has brought high mortality rates to Indigenous Peoples, and the smoke from widespread burning adds yet another deadly layer by worsening respiratory risks. The very people who have protected the forest for generations are now among those most at risk.

Yet there is mounting pressure for change. Investors and the public are increasingly demanding that governments and companies act responsibly. This means pushing for stronger environmental laws and real enforcement, adequate funding for environmental agencies, full protection of Indigenous rights and territories, and an end to doing business with those who destroy the forest.

The Amazon cannot withstand another year like the last. Ending the destruction, protecting Indigenous Peoples, and confronting the climate and biodiversity crises requires decisive action now—from governments, companies, investors, and all of us who depend on the forest’s survival.
