In the dry heart of La Ligua, in one of the places hardest hit by Chile’s water crisis, a group of women, musicians, and activists came together to raise their voices against the privatization of water. From this meeting of stories, sounds, and resistance emerged “Canto del Agua,” a collective song born from Greenpeace’s Roots project in Chile, in collaboration with local communities, the MODATIMA Women’s collective, and Finland’s Sibelius Music Academy.

The workshop took place in a context where the lack of water is not seen only as a consequence of drought, but as the result of looting and a model that has turned water into a commodity. Participants shared how this crisis has torn apart families, forced migration, and destroyed territories. These testimonies were not just spoken; they were transformed into rhythm, melody, and lyrics.

Throughout the process, musicians and activists worked side by side. They collected sounds, experimented with rhythmic improvisation, and co-created musical pieces that reflected their lived realities. Each activity was a step toward shaping a shared voice: a song that could carry their demands and their pain, but also their strength and determination.

The culmination of this work was a concert held on the World Day to Combat Desertification and Drought. There, “Canto del Agua” was performed publicly, connecting the local struggle in La Ligua with a broader call for justice in the face of environmental degradation and water inequality.

After the concert, the song was recorded for digital promotion, with the intention that it serve as an anthem for the de-privatization of water. “Canto del Agua” is more than a musical piece; it is a tool of resistance and a collective expression of communities that refuse to be silent in the face of a system that denies them access to such a fundamental element of life.
