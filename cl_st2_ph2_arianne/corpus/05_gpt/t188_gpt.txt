If you’re looking for films and documentaries that stir both your heart and your conscience, there’s a growing list of powerful stories that shine a light on the climate crisis, inequality, and our relationship with the planet.

One that has sparked a lot of conversation is the satirical film “Don’t Look Up.” The movie uses the metaphor of a comet hurtling toward Earth to represent the climate crisis, and follows scientists desperately trying to warn a world that refuses to listen. Its portrait of experts being sidelined, ridiculed, or simply ignored has resonated deeply with many people in the climate movement, including Greenpeace co-founder Rex Weyler, who sees in it a reflection of decades of struggle to get governments and corporations to act on scientific warnings.

From there, the list of recommended viewing branches out into a range of themes and formats. A hard-hitting documentary challenges myths about meat consumption and features Arnold Schwarzenegger, confronting viewers with the environmental and health impacts of industrial animal agriculture. “Sexy Killer” digs into the scandal-ridden coal industry in Indonesia, exposing how destructive and dangerous this fossil fuel remains, especially for the communities living in its shadow.

Another film turns to Australia’s oceans, documenting the devastating reality of coral bleaching and what it means for marine ecosystems already under severe stress. Leonardo DiCaprio’s climate-focused journey takes audiences around the world, showing how global the crisis is and how interconnected the solutions must be.

For those interested in the roots of environmental activism, there’s a film that tells the story of Greenpeace’s founding, tracing how a small group of people came together to challenge some of the most powerful interests on Earth. Fiction also has a place in this list: “Parasite” is highlighted for the way it explores inequality and its intersections with climate impacts, revealing how the poorest and most marginalised are often hit first and worst.

The oceans return to centre stage through the work of Sylvia Earle, whose advocacy underscores both the beauty and fragility of marine life and the urgent need to protect it. A documentary on minimalism makes the case for consuming less and living more simply, inviting viewers to question a culture of endless growth and overconsumption. And stories from Brazil bring the climate crisis down to a very human level, following people whose lives and livelihoods are already being reshaped by changing weather patterns and environmental destruction.

These films and documentaries offer many entry points into understanding the climate emergency and imagining different futures. If you’ve seen any of them—or have your own favourites that moved you, informed you, or pushed you to act—share them. Stories can change minds, and the more we watch, discuss, and recommend them, the stronger our collective push for change becomes.
