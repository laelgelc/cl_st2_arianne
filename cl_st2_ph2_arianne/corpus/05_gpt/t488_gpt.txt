Mwende stands in the middle of her three-acre farm in Kitui County, Kenya, watching what should have been a season of relief slip away before her eyes. For three years, drought has shrunk her harvests and strained her ability to pay school fees and feed her family. This year, the heavy rains finally came. The soil held promise. Her green grams, cowpeas, maize, and millet were thriving. Then, on February 3, everything changed.

A massive swarm of desert locusts descended on her fields, turning the sky into a moving, hungry cloud. The insects covered her crops, devouring the leaves and stems that represented months of labour and hope. In a desperate attempt to protect her livelihood, Mwende did what many farmers in her community do: she tore off a sheet of iron and spent days swinging it through the air, shouting and clanging to scare the locusts away. It was exhausting, relentless work, and the swarm kept returning.

This outbreak is not an isolated misfortune. It is part of the worst desert locust invasion the region has seen in decades. Climate change is making it worse. Unusual, climate-driven cyclones over recent years have created perfect breeding conditions for locusts, allowing their numbers to explode. Where there might once have been scattered insects, there are now dense swarms capable of stripping fields bare in hours.

For smallholder farmers like Mwende, the impact is immediate and devastating. Every plant eaten is a meal lost, income lost, and school fees put further out of reach. Green grams and cowpeas that were nearly ready for harvest are shredded. Maize and millet, staples for her family, are left skeletal. After years of drought, the heavy rains had finally raised hopes of a bumper harvest. Instead, those same rains now threaten to fuel a new wave of destruction.

The danger does not end when the visible swarms move on. The locusts lay eggs in the soil, and with the next rains, new generations are expected to hatch. Each new wave brings the risk of more swarms, more fields overrun, and more farmers pushed to the brink. The insects do not respect boundaries between farms or counties; they move with the wind, devouring vegetation across wide areas.

Communities are doing what they can with the tools they have: banging metal, shouting, waving cloths and iron sheets in the air to scare the insects away from their crops. But the scale of the crisis far exceeds what individual farmers can manage alone. The swarms are vast, and the conditions that created them are tied to a changing climate that farmers like Mwende did nothing to cause.

Farmers in affected areas are calling for urgent government action to confront this climate-exacerbated crisis. They are demanding support that matches the scale of the threat: swift measures to control the swarms, protect remaining crops, and prevent new outbreaks as the rains return. Without rapid, coordinated action, the locusts will continue to erase harvests, deepen hunger, and undermine the hard work of smallholder farmers who are already on the frontlines of climate impacts.

For Mwende, the struggle continues in the dust and noise of her fields, iron sheet in hand, fighting to save what she can. Her story is one among many, but together, these stories carry a clear message: climate change is not a distant future problem. It is here, it is reshaping lives and livelihoods, and it demands urgent, concrete responses to protect people and the food they depend on.
