Far out in the Indian Ocean, hundreds of kilometres from the nearest shore, lies a vast, shallow underwater plateau about the size of Belgium: the Saya de Malha Bank. Hidden beneath the waves, this remote marine wilderness hosts the largest known seagrass meadow on Earth, fringed by shallow coral communities and teeming with life.

Here, endangered turtles glide over the seafloor, and the deep waters around the bank are home to ocean giants like sperm whales and pygmy blue whales. This rich, largely unseen ecosystem is one of the beating hearts of our blue planet.

Seagrass meadows like those on Saya de Malha are quiet climate heroes. They capture and store significant amounts of CO2, locking carbon away in their roots and surrounding sediments. At the same time, they act as nurseries for countless marine species, offering food and shelter to young fish, invertebrates, and other sea life. Yet around the world, seagrass meadows are in decline because of human activity, putting both marine biodiversity and a vital natural climate solution at risk.

Despite its remoteness, Saya de Malha is not safe. Industrial fishing fleets, including vessels from the European Union, target the surrounding waters using destructive methods such as purse seine nets and longlines. These techniques drive overfishing of species like yellowfin tuna and also cause high levels of bycatch: endangered turtles, whales, and sharks become entangled or hooked, often with fatal consequences. The pressure from this industrial exploitation threatens to unravel the delicate web of life that depends on this extraordinary bank.

Because Saya de Malha lies in international waters, it falls beyond the jurisdiction of any single country. That makes a strong Global Ocean Treaty essential. Only with a robust, enforceable treaty can the world create fully protected ocean sanctuaries on the high seas—places where industrial fishing and other destructive activities are off-limits, giving ecosystems like Saya de Malha the space they need to recover and thrive.

Protecting Saya de Malha is about more than saving one special place. It is about defending the largest seagrass meadow we know of, safeguarding endangered species, and preserving a powerful natural ally in the fight against climate breakdown.

You can help. Add your name to the call for a strong Global Ocean Treaty and the creation of ocean sanctuaries in international waters. Together, we can push governments to protect Saya de Malha and other irreplaceable marine ecosystems before it’s too late.
