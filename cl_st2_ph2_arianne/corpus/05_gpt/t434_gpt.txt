As the world grapples with the COVID-19 pandemic, oil and plastic companies are seizing the moment to push a familiar agenda: more single-use plastics. By spreading misinformation and playing on people’s fears, they are lobbying for bailouts and weaker regulations, trying to frame disposable plastics as the only safe option during a health crisis.

This narrative runs directly counter to what independent health experts are saying. Nearly 130 health professionals have affirmed that reusable items—like cups and bags—can be used safely during the pandemic if they are washed properly. The core principle is straightforward: hygiene and proper cleaning practices are what protect us, not whether something is disposable or reusable.

Plastic is often marketed as “clean” or “sanitary,” but the material itself does not magically stop viruses. In fact, evidence shows that the virus can survive longer on plastic than on cardboard. That means single-use plastic packaging is not a guarantee of safety. What matters is how we handle and wash items, not the fact that they are wrapped in or made of plastic.

The same logic applies to food and produce. Whether fruits and vegetables come wrapped in plastic or are sold loose, they should be washed thoroughly before eating. Packaging type does not replace basic food hygiene. Washing produce is a simple, effective step to reduce risk, regardless of whether plastic is involved.

Beyond the immediate health concerns, plastic’s broader impacts remain as serious as ever. Plastics are a major source of environmental pollution—from littered bags and bottles to microplastics in our oceans and soils. The production and disposal of plastics also contribute to the climate crisis, tying our everyday consumption directly to rising greenhouse gas emissions. These harms are not distributed equally: low-income communities often bear the brunt of plastic waste, living near landfills, incinerators, and polluting facilities that handle the world’s discarded materials.

In a time of global uncertainty, decisions about public health and environmental policy must be guided by science, not by industry lobbyists seeking to protect their profits. The pandemic should not be used as a pretext to roll back hard-won protections or lock society into greater dependence on single-use plastics. Proper hygiene and evidence-based guidelines allow us to stay safe while also protecting the environment and the communities most affected by pollution and waste.
