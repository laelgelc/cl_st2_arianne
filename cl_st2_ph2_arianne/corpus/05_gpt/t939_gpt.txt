For a long time, Shell treated the Arctic as just another frontier for profit. But a global movement of activists, petitioners, and supporters refused to let that happen quietly. Through protests, petitions, and relentless public pressure, people all over the world pushed the story of Arctic drilling out of corporate boardrooms and into headlines—and they won.

Shell has now abandoned its plans to drill in the Arctic. The company poured over $7 billion into the project, only to walk away. It didn’t find enough oil to justify continuing. It faced a challenging regulatory environment shaped in no small part by worldwide opposition. And it had to reckon with the enormous risks involved, including a 75% chance of oil spills in one of the most fragile regions on Earth.

Those risks are not abstract. Drilling in the Arctic threatens to accelerate the melting already underway, displace communities who depend on this environment for their survival, and harm wildlife uniquely adapted to the cold. An oil spill in these conditions would be almost impossible to clean up, with consequences that could last for generations.

People power helped stop one of the world’s biggest oil companies from drilling in one of the world’s most vulnerable places. This is a victory for everyone who marched, signed, organized, spoke out, or stood up. It shows that when people unite and refuse to back down, even the largest corporations can be forced to change course.

But this is not the end of the story. Shell leaving the Arctic does not mean the Arctic is safe. Other oil companies still see this region as a source of profit, not a home to communities and wildlife already under threat from the climate crisis. The fight now is for permanent protection of the Arctic—protection that keeps all oil companies out, for good.

The movement that stopped Shell will continue to grow, because the stakes are too high to do anything else. The Arctic needs lasting safeguards, and it’s clear that when people come together, they have the power to win them.
