I began my university life staring up at rockets, not birds. Aerospace engineering promised a future among machines and equations, a world where forces were cleanly defined and problems could be solved with the right design. But outside the classroom, another story was unfolding—one that would slowly pull me from the sky back down to rivers, forests, and oceans.

Rachel Carson’s *Silent Spring* was one of the first cracks in the armor of that technological dream. Her clear, courageous account of how pesticides were poisoning birds, water, and soil revealed something I had not yet grasped: the tools we created to control nature were unraveling the very fabric of life. The book showed how chemicals, designed with a single purpose, rippled outward through food webs and ecosystems, causing silent, cascading harm. It was my first deep encounter with unintended consequences on a planetary scale.

Then came the shocking images and reports of the Cuyahoga River catching fire in 1969. A river so polluted with industrial waste that it could burn was not just an environmental disaster; it was a symbol of a worldview gone wrong. The idea that we could dump toxins into waterways and somehow keep the damage contained was revealed as an illusion. The flames on that river made it impossible to pretend that pollution was a distant or abstract problem. It was visible, immediate, and undeniable.

Around the same time, I encountered Gregory Bateson’s lectures, which offered a language for what I was beginning to feel. Bateson spoke of patterns, feedback, and complex systems, insisting that “all divisions are arbitrary.” He challenged the habit of carving the world into separate pieces—nature and humans, mind and body, economy and ecology—as if those boundaries were real instead of convenient. His ideas helped me see that the crises we faced were not isolated issues, but symptoms of a deeper failure to understand relationships.

Indigenous teachings deepened that realization. From elders such as Fools Crow, I learned the phrase “Mitakuye-Oyasin”—“all my relations.” It expressed in a few words what systems theory and ecology were struggling to articulate: that we are embedded in a vast web of kinship with rivers, animals, plants, and winds. These were not poetic metaphors but living principles for how to behave in the world. To say “all my relations” is to recognize that every action, every decision, touches countless others.

This sense of kinship did not begin in lecture halls or books. As a child, I had a close encounter with a magpie that stayed with me. In that moment, I felt the bird not as an object in nature, but as a presence—a fellow being sharing the same world, the same air, the same vulnerability. That early experience planted a seed of relationship with the wild, a feeling that the creatures around me were not scenery, but neighbors.

Over time, these influences—Carson’s warnings, the burning river, Bateson’s patterns, Indigenous teachings, and that magpie—wove together into a new understanding of ecology. Ecology was no longer just the study of organisms and their environments; it became a way of seeing the world as a web of relationships, where every thread matters. In such a world, there is no “away” to throw things to, no truly separate “other” to exploit without consequence.

This shift in perspective changed the course of my life. I moved from engineering into ecology, and then into journalism, trying to give voice to the stories of these interconnected crises and the people resisting them. Speaking truth about pollution, power, and responsibility came with a cost, and ultimately led to exile in Canada. But that displacement also opened a new path.

In Canada, the threads of these experiences came together in action. The understanding of complex systems and unintended consequences, the reverence for relational webs in nature, and the sense of kinship with other beings all pointed toward a simple conclusion: it was not enough to describe the damage; we had to help stop it. This led to the founding of Greenpeace, grounded in the belief that protecting whales, oceans, and other beings is inseparable from protecting ourselves.

Efforts such as actions to protect whales grew from this recognition of relationship. Whales were not just charismatic animals; they were integral participants in ocean ecosystems, part of a living network that sustains life on Earth. To defend them was to defend the integrity of the whole.

Looking back, the journey from aerospace engineering to ecology was not a rejection of science, but an expansion of it. It was a movement from seeing the world as a set of isolated problems to be engineered away, toward seeing it as a living tapestry of relationships to be respected, cared for, and defended. Every river, every bird, every whale is a reminder that “all my relations” is not just a teaching, but a responsibility.
