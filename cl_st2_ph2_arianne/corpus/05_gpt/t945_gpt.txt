For seven days, Greenpeace activists aboard the Esperanza patrolled the Gulf of California, focusing on the waters near the Bay of San Felipe. During this patrol, they discovered ten illegal gillnets and documented boats fishing inside the vaquita porpoise’s protected habitat.

The vaquita is on the brink of extinction. Estimates have fallen from 97 individuals to as few as 57, and the main threat comes from gillnets used to catch totoaba. Totoaba is highly valued in China, and the illegal trade in this fish drives the continued use of these deadly nets in the vaquita’s range.

As the crew of the Esperanza located illegal gillnets, they documented their findings and reported them to the authorities, which led to the nets being removed from the water. Greenpeace activists also engaged with local fishermen, discussing more sustainable fishing practices and the urgent need to protect the vaquita and its habitat.

There is currently a two-year ban on fishing in the vaquita’s habitat, but enforcement is severely limited. Just two officials are responsible for monitoring an area of 11,000 km². Without stronger government action and effective monitoring, the vaquita faces the risk of disappearing as soon as 2018.
