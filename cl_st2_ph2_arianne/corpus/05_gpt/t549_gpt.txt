The global car industry likes to present itself as part of the solution to the climate and health crises. Slick adverts show “clean” cars gliding through empty green landscapes, families breathing fresh air, and slogans about “innovation” and “sustainability.” But behind this carefully crafted image lies a stark reality: in 2018, the car industry was responsible for 9% of global greenhouse gas emissions – more than the entire European Union.

This is not the footprint of an industry that is on track to protect our climate, our health, or our safety. It is the footprint of a sector that has delayed change, exploited loopholes, and kept pushing bigger, heavier, more polluting vehicles while claiming to go green.

Instead of rapidly cutting emissions, major carmakers have spent years lobbying against strong regulations, marketing high-emission SUVs, and dragging their feet on real transformation. Companies like Volkswagen and Hyundai-Kia are being called out for exploiting loopholes and cheating regulations, all while continuing to prioritise the sale of large, high-emission vehicles that lock in pollution for years to come.

This is greenwashing: pretending to care about the environment, public health, and road safety while business as usual continues almost unchanged. Swapping some petrol models for hybrids or a handful of premium electric SUVs does not align the industry with the Paris Agreement. Nor does it protect communities already facing air pollution, climate disasters, and unsafe streets.

To help keep global heating within the Paris climate limits, the direction of travel has to change – fast. That means:

- Phasing out diesel, petrol, and hybrid cars completely.  
- Ending new sales of these vehicles by 2028.  
- Shifting production towards smaller, lighter, more efficient electric vehicles instead of oversized, resource-hungry models.  

But cleaner cars alone are not enough. A truly climate-safe and people-centred transport system must reduce overall car dependence. Greenpeace is calling for a rapid transition away from car-dominated mobility and towards:

- High-quality, affordable public transport  
- Renewable energy to power transport systems  
- Safe cycling infrastructure  
- Walkable cities and towns  
- Micro-mobility solutions that reduce the need for private cars  

This is what a transport system compatible with the Paris Agreement looks like: fewer cars overall, and the remaining vehicles cleaner, smaller, and more efficient.

People are no longer willing to accept the gap between what carmakers say and what they do. On September 14, protests are planned at the Frankfurt Motor Show, one of the industry’s flagship events. Activists and citizens will come together to expose the industry’s greenwashing and demand a real break with polluting business models.

An open letter accompanying these protests directly targets companies such as Volkswagen and Hyundai-Kia for their role in blocking progress. It highlights how they have exploited loopholes, cheated regulations, and continued to prioritise high-emission SUVs and other polluting models over the public interest and a safe climate.

The message to the car industry is clear: stop pretending, start transforming. End the production and sale of diesel, petrol, and hybrid cars by 2028. Stop pushing oversized, high-emission vehicles. Commit to smaller, lighter electric cars and support a rapid shift to public transport, renewables, cycling, walking, and micro-mobility.

Anything less is not leadership – it is greenwashing. And people are organising to make sure the world knows the difference.
