Corporations have unleashed a plastic monster on the world, and it is growing fast. More than 90% of all plastics are never recycled, and global production is on track to quadruple by 2050. Against this scale of pollution, recycling alone cannot solve the crisis. The system is designed for disposability, and corporations are driving it.

Around the world, people are fighting back. A powerful, growing movement is challenging the plastic monster at its source. Over 3 million people have joined the call to end plastic pollution, and 1,400 allies in the Break Free From Plastic movement have come together to demand real change. As part of this effort, volunteers carried out 239 cleanups in 42 countries, documenting and identifying the brands most responsible for plastic pollution on beaches, rivers, and communities. These cleanups do more than collect trash: they expose the companies behind the waste.

Greenpeace’s “Crisis of Convenience” report took a closer look at corporate promises. The report surveyed 11 major companies to see whether their public commitments on plastic were backed by real plans to move away from single-use packaging. The findings were stark: none of the companies had a comprehensive strategy to abandon single-use plastics. Instead, despite their pledges, most are planning to increase their use of single-use packaging. This exposes a dangerous gap between what companies say and what they are actually doing.

To confront this, Greenpeace is taking the message directly to the sources of plastic production and pollution. The ships Rainbow Warrior and Beluga are being deployed to highlight where plastic pollution begins, not just where it ends up. By tracing plastics back to their corporate origins, Greenpeace is pushing companies to take responsibility for the full life cycle of their products.

The demands are clear. Corporations like Nestlé and Unilever must be transparent about how much plastic they produce and where it goes. They must commit to real reductions in single-use packaging, not just small tweaks or recycled-content claims. And they must invest in and adopt reusable, refillable, and alternative delivery systems that do not rely on throwaway plastics.

The plastic monster was created by corporate decisions to prioritize convenience and profit over the health of people and the planet. It can be stopped only if those same corporations change course. The global movement rising up against plastic pollution is showing that people are no longer willing to accept a world suffocated by single-use plastics. Now it is up to the companies that created this crisis to act: to be honest, to reduce, and to help build a future beyond the plastic monster.
