Around the world, communities and movements are winning important battles for environmental justice and climate protection. These victories, rooted in persistence and collective action, show that change is possible even in the face of powerful corporate and political interests.

In the coastal municipality of Cayar, local people have pushed back against destructive industrial practices. The municipality banned a fishmeal factory’s wastewater discharge, a step that strengthens community protection and supports ongoing litigation. For residents who depend on a healthy ocean for their livelihoods and food, stopping toxic discharges is not abstract policy—it is a matter of survival and dignity. This decision demonstrates how local authorities can act to defend communities and ecosystems when people organise and demand accountability.

Decades of protest and public pressure have also transformed Europe’s energy landscape. In Germany, the last nuclear reactor shut down on 15 April 2023, after a long history of resistance from anti-nuclear movements. This closure is more than a symbolic milestone: it opens the way for a faster transition to renewable energy. Ending nuclear power in Germany removes a major obstacle often used to delay or distract from investment in truly sustainable, clean energy sources.

Courts are increasingly recognising that governments must uphold environmental and health protections. The European Union Court ruled that Bulgaria’s permits for coal plants violated pollution laws. These plants caused thousands of deaths and billions in health costs. The ruling exposes how dangerous it is when authorities allow polluters to breach legal limits, and it underscores that polluted air is not an unavoidable by-product of economic development but a preventable injustice. Legal victories like this one set precedents that can help protect people across the region.

On the global stage, hard-won agreements are emerging to safeguard the planet’s life-support systems. Governments secured a Global Ocean Treaty that will allow the creation of marine sanctuaries and help protect 30% of the world’s oceans by 2030. This is a crucial step toward defending marine biodiversity from overfishing, deep-sea mining, and industrial exploitation. Properly implemented, the treaty can turn large swaths of the high seas into safe havens where nature can recover and thrive.

Climate justice is also advancing through international law. The United Nations General Assembly requested an advisory opinion from the International Court of Justice on states’ climate duties. This historic move was driven by the efforts of students from Pacific Island nations, who live on the frontlines of the climate crisis. By asking the world’s highest court to clarify governments’ obligations, these young people are using international law as a tool to demand stronger climate action and protection of human rights.

Closer to home for many travellers, aviation is beginning to face long-overdue constraints. Schiphol Airport announced it will ban private jets and night flights from 2025 because of their pollution. This decision directly addresses both climate and noise impacts. It challenges the idea that the most polluting, luxury forms of travel should continue unchecked while communities living near airports bear the health and quality-of-life costs.

Finally, courts are pushing back against corporate attempts to silence environmental defenders. In the United States, a court dismissed a logging company’s Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation (SLAPP) filed against Greenpeace. The dismissal is a boost for free speech and for everyone who speaks out against environmental destruction. It confirms that powerful companies cannot simply sue critics into silence when they raise concerns about forests, climate, or human rights.

Taken together, these victories—from coastal towns and courtrooms to parliaments and global treaties—show that people power works. Communities are stopping pollution at its source, phasing out dangerous technologies, holding governments to their own laws, carving out space for nature to recover, and defending the right to speak truth to power. Each win is a reminder that environmental justice is not an abstract ideal but a living struggle, advanced step by step by those who refuse to give up.
