On World Environment Day, it’s impossible not to think of the people who make every day about protecting our shared home. Volunteers, supporters, activists, and campaigners across the globe are out in their communities, on the streets, and behind the scenes, pushing for the change our planet so urgently needs. Their courage and persistence turn concern into action, and their passion keeps hope alive when the reality of climate change feels overwhelming.

The impacts of a warming world are no longer distant or abstract; they are woven into the fabric of daily life. We see it in the weather that feels “off,” in seasons that no longer behave as expected, in patterns that used to be rare but are now uncomfortably familiar. What was once considered extreme is increasingly becoming part of our everyday experience.

Recent events show just how far beyond “normal” our climate has shifted. In Shanghai, the city recorded its hottest May day in 100 years—a stark marker of how rapidly temperatures are rising. In Italy, devastating floods have swept through communities, causing widespread damage and taking more than a dozen lives. These are not isolated incidents; they are part of a pattern of intensifying heat waves and extreme weather that is unfolding around the world.

Yet, despite these clear and painful signals, many world leaders continue to look away or respond with half-measures that fall far short of what is needed. While people on the frontlines are losing homes, livelihoods, and loved ones, those with the most power to act often move too slowly, or not at all.

Heat waves and extremes may be becoming routine, but they must never be accepted as the new normal. Each shattered temperature record, each flooded town, each community struggling to rebuild should be a wake-up call. The images of these crises—of parched fields, submerged streets, and exhausted first responders—are not just scenes of suffering; they are a call to unite.

World Environment Day is a reminder that we are not powerless in the face of this crisis. The commitment of Greenpeace’s global community shows what is possible when people refuse to give up. Their actions send a clear message: the story of our climate future is still being written.

The hardships we see around the world should not lead to despair, but to determination. They should push us to stand together, to demand more from those in power, and to support each other in building a safer, more just world. If we allow these images of difficulty and loss to strengthen our resolve, then every day can be a day of action for the environment, and every person can be part of the solution.
