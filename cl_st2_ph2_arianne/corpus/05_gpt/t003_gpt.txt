On World Environment Day, it’s impossible not to think about the millions of people who make up the Greenpeace community around the globe: volunteers, supporters, activists, and campaigners who show up, day after day, to defend our shared home. Their courage and commitment are what keep hope alive in a world where the impacts of climate change are no longer distant predictions, but daily realities.

Every banner raised, every petition signed, every peaceful action taken is part of a much bigger story: people refusing to give up on a safer, fairer, more livable planet. That determination is what pushes us to keep going, even as the signs of a heating world become harder and harder to ignore.

Those signs are all around us. Recent extreme weather events are stark reminders that the climate crisis is already here. In Shanghai, the city recorded its hottest May day in a century. At the same time, Italy has been hit by severe flooding that destroyed homes and infrastructure and cost more than a dozen people their lives. These are not abstract statistics; they represent families, communities, and entire regions struggling to cope with conditions they did not create and cannot control.

These events should never be accepted as the new normal. Each record-breaking heatwave and each devastating flood is a warning that our leaders should be heeding. Instead, too many of those in power continue to look away, delay action, or downplay the scale of the crisis. Their inaction stands in stark contrast to the urgency experienced by communities on the frontlines and to the energy of people everywhere who demand change.

The images from Shanghai’s scorching heat and Italy’s catastrophic floods are part of a growing global album of climate impacts: streets turned into rivers, homes submerged, lives uprooted. They show, in painful detail, how quickly “business as usual” can collapse when pushed beyond the limits of what nature can bear.

But these images also carry another message: we are all connected. What happens in one part of the world affects us all, and our response must be just as global and united. No country, city, or community can face this crisis alone. The strength of the Greenpeace community lies precisely in this understanding—that the struggle for climate justice is shared, and that solidarity across borders is not optional, but essential.

On this World Environment Day, the call is clear. We cannot normalize disaster. We cannot allow record-breaking heat and deadly floods to be treated as background noise. We must stand together—supporters, volunteers, activists, and campaigners—to demand that leaders finally listen to the warnings written in rising temperatures and swollen rivers.

The path forward depends on our collective resolve. If we stay united, refuse to look away, and continue to raise our voices, we can help ensure that the story told by future images is not one of escalating crisis, but of people coming together in time to protect the only home we have.
