The Yanomami Land, Brazil’s largest Indigenous territory, lies in the Amazon forest along the border with Venezuela. Around 20,000 Indigenous people live there, but their home is being overrun by an estimated 20,000 illegal miners. This invasion is not only a violation of Indigenous rights; it is driving environmental destruction, poisoning rivers and food sources, and causing a deep humanitarian crisis.

Illegal mining operations in the Yanomami territory rely heavily on mercury, a toxic substance used to extract gold. Mercury contaminates rivers and accumulates in fish and other food sources that local communities depend on. As a result, the Yanomami are consuming poisoned water and food, which is leading to severe health problems and even deaths. The contamination spreads through the ecosystem, turning vital rivers into channels of illness instead of life.

The presence of thousands of miners in the forest has also brought disease and hunger. Miners have helped spread malaria, with 11,530 cases recorded in 2022 alone. At the same time, environmental destruction and river pollution make traditional hunting, fishing, and agriculture more difficult, contributing to widespread malnutrition. Children are especially affected, facing the combined impacts of disease, contaminated food and water, and loss of secure livelihoods.

The scale of the illegal mining boom in the Yanomami Land is staggering. Between 2019 and 2021, during the Bolsonaro government, illegal mining in the territory increased by 1,963%. In 2022, a 150-kilometre illegal road was observed cutting through the forest, opening the way for even more miners, machinery, and environmental damage. Each new incursion deepens the crisis, further degrading the forest and undermining the survival of Indigenous communities who have protected it for generations.

Today, there are signs of a shift. The new Lula government has created the Ministry of Indigenous Peoples, led by Sônia Guajajara, and has signalled a commitment to systemic protections for Indigenous rights and for the people of the Amazon. This change in political direction is crucial for the Yanomami. It opens the door to stronger enforcement against illegal mining, better protection of Indigenous territories, and policies that place the survival and well-being of Indigenous peoples and the forest at the centre of decision-making.

The Yanomami Land stands at a crossroads. On one side is the ongoing advance of illegal mining, bringing mercury, disease, and hunger. On the other is the possibility of real protection, driven by a government that recognises Indigenous rights and the importance of the Amazon for people and planet. The choices made now will determine whether the Yanomami and their forest can recover from the damage already done, and whether this vital territory can remain a living homeland instead of a sacrifice zone.
