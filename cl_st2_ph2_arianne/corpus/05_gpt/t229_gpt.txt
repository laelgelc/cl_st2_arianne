Every year, as Black Friday, Singles Day, Cyber Monday and other end-of-year sales roll around, the same story repeats itself: a global push to buy more, faster, and cheaper. The discounts look irresistible, but the real price is quietly paid by the planet.

These consumption spikes are not just about crowded shopping carts and overloaded delivery vans. They are the visible tip of a system that treats low prices as the only thing that matters, ignoring the environmental costs of what we buy, how it is made, and how it reaches us.

This matters even more in a world that is rapidly urbanising. Today, 55% of the world’s population lives in cities, and that figure is projected to reach 70% by 2050. Urban areas are already responsible for about 70% of global greenhouse gas emissions, much of it driven by how city residents consume: the products they buy, the energy they use, the food they eat, and the waste they generate.

Instead of questioning this model, many governments are doubling down on it. In the name of economic recovery after COVID-19, they encourage more spending and promote consumerism as a quick route to growth. E-commerce platforms have seized this opportunity, expanding rapidly and making it easier than ever to fill a digital basket in seconds and have goods shipped across continents.

But every “fast” purchase has a slow, heavy footprint. High-carbon emissions are embedded in the entire life cycle of the products we rush to buy: the extraction of raw materials, the energy-intensive manufacturing, the long-distance shipping, and the layers of packaging that are used once and thrown away. When we focus only on the bargain price, we ignore these hidden costs.

Consuming less and better is not about denial, it is about choice and responsibility. It means stopping to ask: Do I really need this? Could I borrow, share, repair, or buy second-hand instead? If I do need something new, can I choose a more durable, repairable, and lower-impact option? These questions are small, but their impact multiplies when asked by millions of people living in cities.

Cities themselves can play a decisive role in shifting away from wasteful consumption. Local governments can:

- Restrict or ban advertising that pushes overconsumption and climate-damaging products.
- Support and promote repair cafés and community workshops where people can fix, rather than replace, their belongings.
- Encourage reuse and sharing systems, from tool libraries to clothing swaps, that reduce the need for constant new production.

At the same time, cities can and should hold e-commerce companies accountable. That means pushing for practices that reduce emissions and waste across their operations: cleaner logistics, less and better packaging, and business models that prioritise durability and reuse instead of endless turnover.

As end-of-year sales campaigns try to convince us that happiness can be ordered with one click, we need to remember that our choices are part of a much bigger picture. In a world where most people will soon live in cities that already drive the majority of global emissions, how we consume is central to the climate crisis—and to the solutions.

Buying less, buying better, repairing, reusing, and sharing are not just personal lifestyle tweaks. They are essential steps toward reshaping our urban economies so they work within planetary boundaries.
