Plastic pollution is everywhere: in our rivers and oceans, in the food we eat, in the air we breathe. Microplastics and toxic additives are infiltrating ecosystems and our own bodies, threatening wildlife, human health, and the wider environment. Despite this, the plastics industry is planning massive expansion, locking us into even more production and pollution at the very moment we need to be cutting plastic at the source.

To confront this crisis, people around the world are organizing to expose who is responsible for the plastic flooding our communities. In 2018, the Break Free From Plastic movement coordinated brand audits alongside volunteer cleanups. These audits didn’t just collect trash; they documented which companies’ products were showing up most often in the environment. Volunteers sorted and recorded the brands printed on discarded packaging, building a powerful, evidence-based picture of corporate responsibility for plastic pollution.

The results were clear: global corporations are driving the problem. Companies like Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, and Nestlé were repeatedly identified among the top plastic polluters. While many of these companies have made public promises to reduce their environmental impact, these commitments fall far short of what’s needed. They do not match the scale or urgency of the plastic crisis, and they do not address the core issue: the relentless production of single-use plastic.

That’s why people power is so important. Brand audits turn community cleanups into a tool for accountability. By documenting which brands are most commonly found as litter, volunteers generate data that can’t be ignored—data that can be used to push governments and corporations to act, and to demand real solutions that prioritize reduction and reuse over endless plastic production.

On World Cleanup Day, September 21, people everywhere are invited to take part in even larger brand audits. Using a simple toolkit, anyone can organize or join an event, collect plastic waste, record the brands, and contribute to a global database exposing the companies most responsible for the pollution crisis. These actions are about more than picking up trash; they are about shifting the blame from individuals to the corporations that profit from disposable products.

By registering an event and participating in a brand audit, you can help grow a powerful global movement that is calling for less plastic production, stronger regulations, and real corporate accountability. Together, we can use this collective evidence to demand that the world’s biggest plastic polluters change course and help build a future free from plastic pollution.
