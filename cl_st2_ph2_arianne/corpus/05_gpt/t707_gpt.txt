Europe is burning from the Mediterranean to the Arctic. From southern coasts to the vast Great Northern Forest that stretches from Sweden across to the Russian Far East, wildfires are tearing through landscapes that should never be ablaze at this scale.

Climate change is driving extreme weather – including intense and prolonged heatwaves – that creates perfect conditions for catastrophic fires. These fires are not just a symptom of the climate crisis; they are also feeding it. As forests burn, they release enormous quantities of greenhouse gases. Wildfires can be responsible for up to 25% of the world’s annual CO2 emissions, turning what should be vital carbon sinks into major sources of pollution.

The Great Northern Forest is a crucial part of the planet’s climate system. Yet in Russia alone, 12.6 million hectares of forest have already burned, and 2.9 million hectares are still on fire. In Sweden, record-breaking fires are raging in up to 60 locations, overwhelming local capacities and burning through areas that were once considered relatively safe from such extremes.

The damage goes beyond CO2. Wildfires release black carbon – tiny particles of soot that can travel long distances. When this black carbon settles on ice and snow in the Arctic, it darkens the surface, causing it to absorb more heat and melt faster. This accelerates warming in one of the most climate-sensitive regions on Earth, creating a dangerous feedback loop.

Most of these fires are caused directly or indirectly by human activity. That means they are not inevitable. They can be prevented through greater care, stronger protections, and serious climate action. It also means the responsibility for stopping them lies with us.

Emissions from these fires must be fully accounted for and included in international climate efforts like the Paris Agreement. Ignoring them undermines global attempts to limit warming and protect the forests that help keep the climate stable.
