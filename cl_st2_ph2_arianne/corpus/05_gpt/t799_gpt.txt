Gazprom’s plan to drive the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline through the Kurgalsky Nature Reserve in North-West Russia would carve a 3.7 kilometre scar through one of the region’s last old-growth forests and permanently damage a truly unique ecosystem.

Kurgalsky is not just another patch of green on the map. It is home to rare and vulnerable species, including the Baltic ringed seal, black-throated loon, ruddy turnstone, garden dormouse, peregrine falcon, and golden eagle. Recently, a nest of the white-tailed sea-eagle was discovered there, underlining once again how important this area is for wildlife that is already under pressure across much of its range.

The proposed pipeline route cuts straight through this protected area. Blasting a corridor through old-growth forest is not something that can be “restored” once the work is done. The damage to habitats, nesting sites, and feeding grounds would be irreversible, and the scars in the landscape would remain long after the pipeline has reached the end of its life.

People in Russia are not standing by in silence. More than 38,000 Russians have already sent letters to the Ministry of Natural Resources, demanding that this destruction be stopped and that Kurgalsky be protected. Greenpeace Russia has taken the fight to the country’s highest court, filing a lawsuit with the Supreme Court to challenge this project.

All of this is happening at a time when the world is moving away from fossil fuels and towards renewable energy. Building new fossil fuel infrastructure in a unique nature reserve runs directly counter to that shift and locks in more climate pollution at the very moment we need to be cutting it.

The Kurgalsky Nature Reserve is irreplaceable. The choice is clear: protect this rare ecosystem and the species that depend on it, or sacrifice it for a fossil fuel project that belongs to the past. Now is the time to stand with the thousands of people in Russia who are speaking out, and to add our voices to the call to stop Nord Stream 2 from cutting through Kurgalsky.
