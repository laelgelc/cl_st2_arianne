Across the Northern Hemisphere, people have been facing record-breaking cold, ice, and snow. From East Asia to Europe, and across the United States down into Texas and northern Mexico, communities have been hit by extreme winter conditions that have disrupted daily life and put lives at risk.

In Texas and northern Mexico, severe cold has pushed energy systems to breaking point. Power grids have failed, leaving millions without heat or electricity in dangerous conditions. Despite attempts in some places to blame renewable energy, the failures in Texas and Mexico have been driven by fossil fuel infrastructure that was not prepared for such extreme cold, rather than by wind or solar power.

These extreme winter events are closely linked to what scientists call the polar vortex. The polar vortex is a swirling ring of cold air high up in the stratosphere above the Arctic. Under more stable conditions, this cold air tends to stay locked around the pole. But as the Arctic warms because of the climate crisis, this ring of cold air can weaken and wobble. When that happens, frigid Arctic air spills southward, bringing unusually harsh winter weather to regions across the Northern Hemisphere.

As the climate crisis drives rapid warming in the Arctic, these disruptions of the polar vortex are becoming more frequent, making extreme winters more likely. What might once have been considered rare is now happening more often, with devastating consequences for people, infrastructure, and ecosystems.

This is why phasing out all fossil fuels is essential. Coal, oil, and gas are at the heart of the climate crisis that is destabilising our weather systems. To protect people from increasingly extreme winters – as well as from heatwaves, floods, and wildfires – we need to shift to 100% renewable energy as fast as possible.

Some governments are beginning to recognise this reality. China, Japan, and Korea have made important commitments that signal a move away from fossil fuels and towards cleaner energy. These commitments must now be turned into concrete action, backed by ambitious policies and real investments in renewable energy, efficiency, and resilient infrastructure.

But this transformation cannot be left to governments and corporations alone. Public pressure is crucial to ensure that promises are kept and that change happens at the speed and scale required. Greenpeace is calling on people everywhere to get involved in our campaign to phase out fossil fuels and accelerate the transition to renewable energy.

By standing together and demanding urgent action, we can help build energy systems that don’t fail in times of crisis, protect communities from escalating climate impacts, and create a safer, more just future for all.
