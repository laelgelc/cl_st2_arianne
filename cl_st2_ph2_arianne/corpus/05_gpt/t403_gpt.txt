Every oil spill is a stark reminder of a deeper truth: as long as we keep extracting, transporting and burning fossil fuels, disasters are not a matter of “if” but “when”. Spills are an inevitable risk built into the fossil fuel system itself. And even what we see is only part of the picture. Official statistics and media coverage tend to focus on the largest, most dramatic incidents, while countless small leaks and spills go unreported or underreported, quietly poisoning ecosystems and communities.

This incomplete data creates a dangerous illusion that spills are rare anomalies. In reality, they are a chronic symptom of an energy model built on drilling, pipelines and tankers. Layered on top of this is the invisible spill happening every day: carbon dioxide released when fossil fuels are burned. Scientists and industry insiders have known about the climate risks of CO2 emissions for decades—warnings about the global warming impact of fossil fuels were already being raised in 1965. Today, in the midst of a climate emergency, we are living through the consequences of ignoring those early alarms.

Recent disasters show how quickly a single incident can upend lives and devastate nature. When the MV Wakashio ran aground off Mauritius, the resulting oil spill contaminated pristine waters and fragile coral reefs. The damage rippled far beyond the immediate coastline. Coral ecosystems that support marine life and protect shores were smothered. The local economy, heavily reliant on tourism and fisheries, was hit hard. For many people, the spill became not just an environmental crisis but a threat to health, livelihoods and food security.

On the other side of the world, oil washing ashore in Venezuela’s Falcón state has had similarly far-reaching impacts. Coastal biodiversity has been harmed as oil coated beaches, mangroves and marine habitats. Local communities, many of whom depend directly on the sea for food and income, have been forced to live with the contamination of their environment. The damage is not only ecological; it is social and economic, compounding existing vulnerabilities.

In the Red Sea, the decaying FSO Safer tanker off the coast of Yemen is a disaster waiting to happen. This unattended vessel, loaded with oil, poses the risk of a massive spill that could spread across the Red Sea, threatening coral reefs, fisheries and coastal communities in multiple countries. For people in Yemen, already enduring a severe humanitarian crisis, such a spill would be catastrophic, jeopardising food supplies, clean water and critical infrastructure. The Safer is a stark symbol of how fossil fuel infrastructure can become a long-term, ticking time bomb.

In Mexico, a leak from a Pemex pipeline has contaminated fields and forced families from their homes. Oil-soaked land is not just a loss of crops; it is a loss of security and identity for communities tied to their territory. Displacement due to fossil fuel pollution adds another layer of injustice to an industry that frequently externalises its risks and costs onto those least able to bear them.

Far to the north, a massive spill by Nornickel in the Russian Arctic has polluted rivers in one of the planet’s most fragile regions. Oil and fuel spreading through cold, slow-recovering ecosystems can leave scars that last for decades. Rivers that sustain wildlife and Indigenous communities have been contaminated, showing how fossil fuel accidents can reach even the most remote and seemingly untouched corners of the Earth.

Taken together, these incidents are not isolated “accidents”; they are part of a pattern. From tropical islands to Arctic rivers, from Latin American farmlands to Middle Eastern waters, oil spills and leaks show how fossil fuels endanger biodiversity, public health, food security and local economies. They also sit atop the broader, ongoing disaster of CO2 emissions driving climate breakdown—emissions we have been warned about since at least 1965.

In a climate emergency, continuing to expand and depend on fossil fuels means accepting more spills, more poisoned land and water, more disrupted lives. The only way to truly reduce the risk is to phase out oil, coal and gas as quickly as possible and accelerate a just transition to renewable energy. Solar, wind and other clean technologies do not come with the same built-in risk of catastrophic spills, nor do they emit CO2 when generating electricity.

Every new spill is another argument for speeding up this transition. Protecting coral reefs, rivers, coastlines and communities from the next inevitable fossil fuel disaster means changing the system that makes those disasters inevitable in the first place.
