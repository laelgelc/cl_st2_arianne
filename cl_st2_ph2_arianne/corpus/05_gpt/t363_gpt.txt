For weeks, the Indonesian government has repeated the same line about the devastating floods in Borneo: this is all because of heavy rainfall, an unavoidable natural disaster. But when entire communities are submerged, forests are stripped bare, and rivers run black with mud and debris, it’s clear that this is not just about rain. This is about a broken system that has allowed forests to be destroyed in the name of profit, leaving people exposed and unprotected.

What is happening in Borneo is the direct result of years of deforestation driven by palm oil plantations, mining concessions, and the steady erosion of environmental protections. When forests are cleared, the land loses its ability to absorb water. Rain that once filtered slowly through dense roots and rich soil now rushes over hard, exposed ground, swelling rivers and triggering floods and landslides. These are not “natural” disasters. They are human-made.

Instead of confronting this reality, officials have tried to shift blame onto the weather. But extreme rain alone does not explain why floods are getting worse, why they are hitting more people, more often, and with greater intensity. The real story lies in satellite images showing shrinking forest cover, in the expansion of industrial plantations and mines, and in the policies that have opened the door to this destruction.

A key turning point was the Omnibus Law, which stripped away crucial environmental safeguards. Among the protections it removed was the requirement to maintain at least 30% forest cover in each watershed and island. That threshold was not a luxury; it was a basic line of defense against floods, erosion, and ecological collapse. By eliminating it, the government has made it easier for corporations to clear forests and exploit land without regard for the consequences.

The Omnibus Law sends a clear message to companies: go ahead, expand. Convert forests into plantations. Carve up land for mines. The law weakens oversight and accountability, while communities downstream are left to deal with the mud, the wrecked homes, the lost livelihoods. It is a policy choice that prioritizes short-term corporate gain over long-term safety and planetary health.

As a Greenpeace campaigner, I have seen this pattern before. In 2015, together with allies and communities, we took legal action to challenge destructive practices and weak enforcement. That lawsuit win showed that people can push back and that the law can be used to defend forests and human rights. It was a moment of hope, proof that organized resistance can force change even in the face of powerful interests.

But victories like that are not enough if new laws simply dismantle the protections we fought to secure. The current crisis in Borneo is a warning of what happens when environmental safeguards are treated as obstacles instead of lifelines. Forests are not just trees to be cleared for profit; they are living systems that regulate water, store carbon, shelter wildlife, and support communities.

Borneo is one of the most biodiverse places on Earth. Its forests are home to countless species found nowhere else, and to Indigenous peoples whose cultures and knowledge are deeply intertwined with the land. When these forests are destroyed, it is not only orangutans, hornbills, and rare plants that are at risk. It is the entire web of life, including the people who depend on healthy ecosystems for clean water, food, and protection from disasters.

The floods are happening against the backdrop of a global climate crisis and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Both have exposed how fragile our systems are when we ignore science and put profit first. The same model of extractive, fossil-fuelled growth that drives deforestation also drives climate breakdown and increases the risk of new diseases. We cannot afford to treat these crises as separate. They are symptoms of the same disregard for planetary boundaries.

Shifting away from this destructive path means rejecting the narrative that blames the sky while letting corporations off the hook. It means demanding policies that keep forests standing, restore degraded land, and stop handing out concessions that sacrifice communities for export commodities. It means embracing renewable energy and sustainable livelihoods instead of doubling down on coal, oil, and deforestation-based industries.

This is not just the responsibility of those living in Borneo. It is a collective struggle that requires unity across regions and sectors: Indigenous communities, farmers, fishers, workers, urban residents, scientists, lawyers, and activists. The 2015 lawsuit showed that when people come together, they can challenge entrenched power. That same spirit of solidarity is needed now, on an even larger scale.

We must insist that the health of the planet is not negotiable. Forest cover requirements should be strengthened, not scrapped. Environmental impact assessments should be rigorous, not rubber stamps. Laws must protect people and nature, not shield corporations from accountability. Any recovery from the economic impacts of COVID-19 must be built around resilience, renewable energy, and ecosystem protection, not around the further exploitation of land and forests.

Borneo’s floods are a stark reminder of the cost of inaction and denial. Every hectare of forest cleared, every regulation weakened, every concession granted in a fragile watershed increases the risk of the next disaster. The choice is between a future of recurring catastrophe and a future in which forests, rivers, and communities can thrive together.

The government can keep pointing to the clouds, but people on the ground know the truth. The water that has swallowed homes and fields carries the evidence of deforestation and deregulation. To honor those who are suffering now—and to prevent even greater suffering in the future—we must stand together to defend Borneo’s forests, protect its biodiversity, and push for a rapid transition to renewable energy and truly sustainable development.

The path forward is clear: restore and protect the forests, strengthen environmental laws instead of tearing them down, and put the health of people and the planet at the center of every decision. Only then will the rain once again be a blessing, not a threat.
