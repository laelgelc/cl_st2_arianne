Yakup Çetinkaya works as the radio operator on the Greenpeace ship Esperanza. From his place on board, he witnessed two non-violent actions targeting dirty palm oil linked to the destruction of Indonesia’s rainforests, home to orangutans and many other species.

These rainforests are being cleared and burned to make way for palm oil plantations. Forest fires used in this expansion release large amounts of CO2, damage human health through toxic smoke, and fuel the climate crisis. Despite public sustainability promises, Wilmar, the world’s largest palm oil trader, has failed to live up to its commitments.

To expose this, the Esperanza followed the tanker Stolt Tenacity from Indonesia to Europe, tracking a shipment of dirty palm oil. At sea, six Greenpeace activists boarded the tanker in a peaceful protest. They were detained on board for 33 hours before being released in Spain.

The journey continued toward the Netherlands. Near Rotterdam, Dutch activists carried out another non-violent action, hanging banners from the ship that read “Stop dirty palm oil.” They faced resistance from the crew and harsh, cold conditions, yet persisted in making their message visible. Their demand was clear: Wilmar and major brands using palm oil, including Oreo, must stop driving forest destruction and start genuinely protecting the world’s remaining rainforests.
