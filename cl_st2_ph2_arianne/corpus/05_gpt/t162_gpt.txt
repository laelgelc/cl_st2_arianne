Russia’s war in Ukraine has intensified a global food crisis, driving up prices and deepening shortages in many parts of the world. This is not an isolated shock: it echoes past crises where millions of people were pushed into hunger while others profited. Once again, it exposes a deeper problem—our food system is fundamentally broken.

Today’s food system is dominated by a handful of powerful corporations that control vast stretches of land and markets. Huge areas of forests, grasslands, and other vital habitats are being destroyed to grow crops not for people, but for animal feed and biofuels. This expansion fuels deforestation and biodiversity loss, while undermining the ecosystems we all depend on for a stable climate, clean water, and fertile soils.

At the same time, corporations and financial actors are making money from food price spikes through speculation on commodity markets. As prices soar, those with the least are forced to choose between food, rent, and other essentials, while some companies record soaring profits. This profiteering in the middle of a crisis lays bare how unjust and fragile the current system is.

Governments have the power—and responsibility—to change course. They must regulate commodities trading to curb excessive speculation and prevent financial markets from driving up food prices. Windfall taxes on the extraordinary crisis profits of food and agribusiness corporations can help fund measures that protect people and the planet instead of rewarding exploitation.

Public investment needs to shift towards agroecology and truly sustainable, resilient farming. Supporting small-scale farmers and local producers is essential, as they are often the backbone of food supply in many regions yet receive a tiny share of public support. Policies must help them access land, seeds, markets, and fair prices.

Ending destructive land use change is crucial. Forests, wetlands, and other ecosystems should not be sacrificed for industrial monocultures, feed crops, and biofuel plantations. Protecting and restoring these ecosystems is key to climate stability, biodiversity, and long-term food security.

Localizing food production and distribution wherever possible can reduce dependence on volatile global supply chains and fossil fuels. Shorter supply chains, local markets, and regionally adapted crops can make food systems more resilient to shocks like wars, pandemics, and extreme weather.

Food must be treated as a human right, not a commodity for speculation. That means prioritizing equitable distribution and access over profit, ensuring that everyone has enough nutritious food regardless of income or where they live.

Individual choices also matter within this wider transformation. Eating more local and seasonal foods, where available, can reduce pressure on distant ecosystems and help strengthen local producers. While personal action cannot replace systemic change, it can support and reinforce the shift towards fairer, more sustainable food systems.

The current crisis is a stark warning: continuing with business as usual will deepen inequality, hunger, and environmental breakdown. By regulating markets, taxing windfall profits, investing in agroecology, supporting small farmers, ending destructive land use, and localizing food systems, governments can help secure food for all while protecting the living world on which we depend.
