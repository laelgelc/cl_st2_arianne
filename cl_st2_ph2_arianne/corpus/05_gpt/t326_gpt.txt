International Workers’ Day is a moment to honour the generations of people whose courage and collective action have transformed working life. Weekends off, sick pay, safer workplaces and so many other hard‑won protections exist because workers stood together, organised and refused to accept exploitation as inevitable. That history of resilience and solidarity is not just something to remember; it is a living source of power for the struggles we face today.

Right now, one of the biggest challenges is how to move from polluting industries to sustainable ones in a way that is fair. Workers in fossil fuels, aviation and other high‑carbon sectors are not responsible for the climate crisis, yet they are often the first to feel the impacts of economic shifts and corporate decisions. A rapid transition is essential to protect the climate, but it must be a just transition – one that puts workers’ rights and livelihoods at the centre.

A just transition means designing the shift away from fossil fuels and other polluting industries so that people are not simply discarded when change comes. That requires strong social safety nets so that no one is left without support as economies transform. It means offering real opportunities for re‑training so workers can move into new roles in sustainable sectors, rather than being pushed into insecurity. It also means employment guarantees wherever possible, so that communities built around polluting industries do not collapse when those industries wind down.

Trade unions and worker representatives must be fully involved in shaping this transition. Workers know their jobs, their communities and the risks they face better than anyone. Their voices are essential in deciding how workplaces change, which skills are needed, and what protections must be in place. Union involvement is also a safeguard against attempts to use climate action as an excuse to erode rights or drive down wages.

Those who have profited most from pollution must pay for the shift. Fossil fuel companies, in particular, have a long record of denial and obstruction that has delayed climate action and deepened the crisis. Their tactics have not only harmed the planet; they have also put workers in vulnerable positions by propping up an unsustainable system. It is only fair that these polluters bear the costs of moving to cleaner energy and supporting the workers and communities affected.

Making this transition real requires policies that are tailored to different sectors and regions. There is no one‑size‑fits‑all solution. Governments need to work with workers, unions and communities to design measures that reflect local realities – from the kinds of green jobs that can be created, to the training programmes and protections that will be needed. Public and private investment in sustainable industries must go hand in hand with strong labour standards, so that “green jobs” are also decent jobs.

International Workers’ Day is a reminder that progress has never been handed down from above. It has been won through organising, persistence and collective action. The same determination is needed now to secure a future that is both environmentally sustainable and socially just. By standing with workers, demanding that polluters pay, and insisting on a just transition that protects people as well as the planet, we can build an economy that honours the legacy of past struggles and creates new possibilities for generations to come.
