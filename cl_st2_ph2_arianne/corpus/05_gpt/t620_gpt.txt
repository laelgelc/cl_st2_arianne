Cyclone Idai has torn through Mozambique, Malawi, and Zimbabwe, leaving a trail of shattered lives, destroyed homes, and broken infrastructure. Millions of people have been affected, and rising death tolls are turning this into what the United Nations has warned may be the worst ever weather-related disaster to hit the Southern African region.

This catastrophe did not come out of nowhere. Extreme weather in the region has been intensifying. Zimbabwe has recently endured a severe drought. In 2000, Cyclone Eline caused widespread destruction. Lake Chilwa, a vital water source and lifeline for surrounding communities, has dried up in recent years, a stark sign of how climate change is reshaping landscapes and livelihoods. The worsening impacts are no longer predictions; they are already here.

In Zimbabwe, the district of Chimanimani has been the hardest hit by Cyclone Idai. Roads have been ripped apart, homes swept away, and entire families lost. Communities that were already struggling now face an almost unimaginable task: rebuilding with fewer resources, in a climate that is becoming more dangerous and unpredictable.

For those in the diaspora, the pain of watching this unfold from afar is coupled with a powerful drive to act. From outside the country, the author turned to social media to mobilize support. What began as a call for help quickly grew into a community effort, with people organizing donations, coordinating supplies, and finding ways to get assistance to those in need. In the middle of disaster, solidarity has become a vital lifeline.

But solidarity alone is not enough. Cyclone Idai is a brutal reminder that climate change is not a distant or abstract threat. It is already reshaping lives and futures across Southern Africa. The Paris Agreement offers a global framework for responding to this crisis, but it must be treated as an urgent priority and woven into every aspect of development planning. Building roads, schools, hospitals, and homes without accounting for a changing climate will only deepen future vulnerability.

At the same time, people-powered movements are growing. Around the world and across the region, communities are standing up to demand more from their leaders: stronger climate policies, faster action, and real support for those on the frontlines of climate impacts. These movements are not waiting for change from above—they are pushing for it from below.

In moments like this, the role of humanitarian organizations on the ground is critical. Groups such as Save the Children, Médecins Sans Frontières, and the Red Cross are working to provide emergency relief, medical care, and essential supplies to those whose lives have been upended. Supporting their efforts is one concrete way to stand in solidarity with affected communities.

Cyclone Idai is a warning and a call to action. It shows the human cost of a warming world, but also the power of collective response. By supporting relief efforts, demanding climate justice, and insisting that climate action and development go hand in hand, we can help ensure that communities are not left to face the next storm alone.
