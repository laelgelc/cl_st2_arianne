Around the world, communities are already living with the reality of extreme weather. Droughts are drying up rivers and farmlands, floods are destroying homes and livelihoods, and fires are tearing through forests and peatlands. At the same time, ice in the Arctic and Antarctic is melting, disrupting ecosystems and contributing to rising sea levels. These impacts are all linked to the escalating climate crisis – a crisis driven by the continued burning of fossil fuels and the destruction of natural ecosystems that should be absorbing carbon, not releasing it.

One of the most devastating and under‑acknowledged examples of this destruction is the burning of peatlands in Indonesia. Greenpeace’s analysis shows that Indonesian peatland fires between 2015 and 2018 released an amount of CO2 comparable to Russia’s annual emissions. In other words, just a few years of fires in one region produced a volume of climate‑heating pollution on the scale of a major industrialized country. These fires act like “carbon bombs”: once ignited, they release enormous stores of carbon built up over thousands of years, with consequences felt across the globe.

The climate impact of these fires rivals that of coal‑fired power plants, some of the most polluting facilities on Earth. Yet the emissions from Indonesian peatland fires are largely missing from the balance sheets and climate plans of the companies and countries that benefit from the industries driving them. This is a massive blind spot in global climate accounting and a stark example of how the true costs of “business as usual” are hidden from public view.

The damage is not only global and long‑term; it is immediate and local. Peatland fires create a toxic haze that blankets vast areas, poisoning the air that millions of people breathe. This haze leads to serious health problems, disrupts daily life, and forces people to live with the constant threat of smoke and fire. Communities on the frontlines pay the price while corporations and governments continue to profit.

Many of the companies linked to this destruction present themselves as sustainability leaders. Global brands, especially those that rely on palm oil in their products, are indirectly connected to peatland fires through their supply chains. Even when they are not setting the fires themselves, their demand for cheap palm oil helps drive the expansion of plantations into forests and peatlands, creating the conditions for these carbon bombs to explode. This contradiction – between green branding and destructive practices – cannot be ignored.

Transparency and accountability are essential. Companies must trace their palm oil supply chains, publish what they find, and cut ties with suppliers that are involved in burning or deforestation. Governments must enforce laws that protect peatlands and forests, close loopholes, and stop turning a blind eye to illegal burning. Financial institutions must stop funding destruction and instead support truly sustainable, community‑centered alternatives.

Ending peatland burning and protecting forests is not only about reducing emissions; it is about defending the right of people everywhere to clean air, safe homes, and a stable climate. It is about standing with those who are already suffering the impacts of a crisis they did little to cause. And it is about choosing a different path – one where our economies no longer depend on burning, clearing, and polluting, but on restoring ecosystems and respecting the limits of our planet.

The world is already seeing what happens when we fail to act: more extreme weather, more fires, more melting ice, and more communities pushed to the brink. But this future is not inevitable. By exposing the hidden carbon bombs in our supply chains, demanding real action from governments and corporations, and protecting the forests and peatlands that safeguard our climate, we can help build a green and peaceful world for future generations.
