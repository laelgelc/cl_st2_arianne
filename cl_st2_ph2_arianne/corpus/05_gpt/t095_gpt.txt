At COP27, a group of agribusiness giants launched “The Roadmap to 1.5,” presenting it as a serious plan to align their operations with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C target. But behind the glossy language and climate buzzwords, this roadmap is yet another collection of hollow pledges that ignore the human and environmental realities of global commodity production.

These companies are major players in the trade of soy, beef, and palm oil. For years, they have announced deforestation commitments and sustainability policies while continuing to profit from forest destruction and abuses on the ground. Firms such as JBS, Marfrig, Cargill, and Wilmar have all made promises to clean up their supply chains. Yet forests and other ecosystems continue to fall, and the rights of Indigenous Peoples, local communities, and workers continue to be violated.

The Amazon, Cerrado, and Gran Chaco are among the regions paying the price. These ecosystems are being destroyed and degraded to make way for cattle ranching, industrial soy, and other commodities. Behind the numbers and corporate statements are real places and communities: forests cleared, rivers polluted, traditional lands invaded, and people pushed aside or exposed to violence and exploitation.

“The Roadmap to 1.5” does not confront these realities. It fails to address the ongoing pattern of human rights abuses and labour violations associated with commodity production. It sidesteps the power imbalances that enable land grabbing, unsafe working conditions, and the criminalization or intimidation of those who defend their territories and livelihoods. In doing so, it allows agribusiness to claim climate leadership while continuing business as usual.

A genuine pathway to 1.5°C cannot be built on greenwashing and voluntary promises that go unfulfilled. It requires a fundamental transformation of how food, feed, and fuel are produced, traded, and consumed. That means protecting all remaining natural ecosystems, not just forests narrowly defined for carbon accounting purposes. It also means restoring areas that have already been destroyed, with restoration financed by the very companies whose supply chains have driven the damage.

Agribusiness must stop hiding behind distant “net zero” dates and vague commitments. Instead, they need to drastically reduce their role in driving demand for land-hungry commodities, including industrial meat and biofuels. The industrial meat system is a major driver of deforestation and ecosystem destruction; reducing demand for meat is essential to reducing pressure on forests and other critical habitats. Likewise, expanding biofuel production is not a climate solution when it comes at the expense of ecosystems and communities.

Transparency is another non-negotiable. Companies must make their supply chains fully traceable and publicly accessible, from farms and ranches through traders and processors to end buyers. Without clear, verifiable information, it is impossible for communities, regulators, or the public to hold them to account. Those found to be destroying ecosystems or violating rights must be immediately suspended and excluded from supply chains, rather than quietly shifted or relabelled.

Respecting and upholding the rights of Indigenous Peoples and local communities must be at the heart of any credible roadmap. This includes recognizing land rights, ensuring free, prior and informed consent, and protecting defenders who speak out against abuses. Indigenous territories and community lands are among the most effective barriers to deforestation and ecosystem destruction, yet they are routinely targeted by agribusiness expansion and associated violence.

Critically, none of this can be outsourced to carbon markets or “offset” through carbon credits. Relying on offsets allows companies to continue expanding destructive production while claiming to be “carbon neutral” on paper. A real 1.5°C pathway requires actual reductions in emissions and impacts within supply chains, not creative accounting.

The world does not need another roadmap that lets agribusiness delay real action while forests fall and communities suffer. It needs binding, enforceable rules and concrete steps that stop destruction, repair past harm, and shift the global food and energy system away from the industrial model that is driving climate breakdown. Agribusiness companies must move from promises to practice: protect and restore ecosystems, reduce demand for destructive commodities, open their supply chains to scrutiny, suspend the destroyers, and fully respect the rights of Indigenous Peoples and local communities—without hiding behind carbon credits.
