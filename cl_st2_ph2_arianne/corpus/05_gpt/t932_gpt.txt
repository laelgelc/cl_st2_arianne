The World Health Organization (WHO) has raised serious concerns about how much meat we eat and what it means for our health. According to WHO, processed meat is classified as carcinogenic, while red meat is considered probably carcinogenic. This means that the way we currently produce and consume meat is not just a dietary choice, but a public health issue.

Beyond health, the environmental footprint of meat and dairy is immense. Producing just one person’s annual consumption of meat and dairy requires around 403,000 liters of water. That’s the equivalent of taking 6,190 showers for a single person’s yearly meat and dairy intake. When scaled up to whole populations, the pressure this puts on freshwater resources is enormous.

The system that makes this possible is industrial animal agriculture, which operates on a staggering scale. Around the world, it breeds roughly 1 billion pigs, 19 billion chickens, and 1.4 billion cattle. This vast number of animals doesn’t just require land and water; it also drives deforestation and climate pollution.

Animal agriculture is responsible for 80% of deforestation in the Amazon. Forests are cleared to make way for pasture and to grow feed crops, destroying critical ecosystems and releasing massive amounts of carbon stored in trees and soils. In total, animal agriculture produces more greenhouse gases than the entire transport sector, making it a major driver of the climate crisis.

Feeding billions of farmed animals also demands huge amounts of crops. Around 80% of the world’s soy production is used for animal feed, not for direct human consumption. This means vast areas of land and huge resource inputs are dedicated to growing feed for livestock instead of food for people.

Another major concern is the use of antibiotics in livestock. In 2011 alone, 8,481 tons of antibiotics were sold for use in EU livestock. This heavy reliance on antibiotics in animal farming raises serious questions about antibiotic resistance and the long-term effectiveness of these vital medicines.

Given the health, ethical, and environmental impacts of current meat consumption, changing what we eat can make a real difference. Reducing weekly meat intake by half and eating more local fruits and vegetables can help lower the demand driving deforestation, greenhouse gas emissions, and intensive resource use. At the same time, these shifts support healthier diets and reduce our contribution to a system that relies on massive antibiotic use and industrial-scale animal farming.

Choosing to eat less meat and more plant-based, locally produced foods is not just a personal lifestyle choice; it is a concrete way to respond to the intertwined crises of climate change, environmental destruction, and public health.
