The Great Northern Forest has always felt like a promise to me.

A promise that somewhere beyond the cities and industrial zones, there is still a place where nature is vast, wild and free. A place where the air smells of moss and pine, where bears wander through the undergrowth and where the last endangered reindeer still find refuge. This forest is one of our strongest allies in the fight against climate change, quietly absorbing carbon and helping to keep our climate stable.

Working as a Press Officer with Greenpeace Russia, I’ve come to understand that this “green shield” is not just a distant wilderness on a map. It is deeply connected to our daily lives and to the products we use without a second thought. As a consumer, I can’t help but question what stands behind the things I buy. How many of our everyday products are silently linked to the destruction of forests like the Great Northern Forest?

Investigations have revealed a disturbing truth. In Russia’s Dvinsky Forest – a vast, unprotected part of the Great Northern Forest – companies are logging in ways that threaten to wipe it out within just a decade. Russian companies including Pomor Timber, Arkhangelsk Pulp and Paper Mill, and Titan Group have been found cutting into this precious landscape.

The Dvinsky Forest is not just any forest. It is one of the last remaining large, intact areas of the Great Northern Forest, a critical habitat for wildlife and a crucial buffer against climate change. Losing it would mean losing irreplaceable ecosystems and pushing endangered species like reindeer closer to the brink.

But the story doesn’t stop at the forest’s edge. The wood taken from Dvinsky doesn’t stay in Russia. It enters global supply chains and ends up in products sold by well-known brands. Companies such as Nestlé, PepsiCo and McDonald’s have been linked through their supply chains to the logging of this unprotected forest.

This connection between the forest and familiar brand names is exactly why change is possible. These companies have the power – and the responsibility – to ensure that their products are not driving the destruction of one of the world’s great forests. Greenpeace is urging them to cut ties with suppliers involved in unsustainable logging and to adopt practices that protect, rather than destroy, the Dvinsky Forest.

The future of this forest should not be decided by short-term profit. It should be shaped by our shared commitment to a living planet – one where bears still roam, where reindeer still find winter shelter, and where forests continue to store carbon and stabilise our climate.

The Dvinsky Forest can still be saved, but time is running out. Greenpeace is calling on people everywhere to add their voices and demand that companies end their role in its destruction. By signing the petition to protect the Dvinsky Forest, we can show brands like Nestlé, PepsiCo and McDonald’s that consumers do not want products linked to forest devastation.

The Great Northern Forest is more than a line on a map. It is a living, breathing ally in our struggle against climate change, a home for wildlife and a source of hope. Standing up for it means standing up for our shared future – and that starts with refusing to let it be logged away in silence.
