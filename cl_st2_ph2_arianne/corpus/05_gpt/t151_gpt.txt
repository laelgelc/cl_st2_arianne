The sun had barely risen over Delhi when a roadside vendor summed up the mood of an entire city: this was the worst day of the year. The heat pressed down with a weight that felt almost physical, radiating off concrete and metal, turning the simplest task into an ordeal. For those who live and work outdoors, there was no escape.

This summer, unbearable heat has scorched India. March, already a difficult month for many communities, turned into a record-hot nightmare compounded by low rainfall. Fields dried out, water sources shrank, and city streets became ovens. For daily wagers, street vendors, and others whose survival depends on spending long hours outside, the heat was not just uncomfortable — it was dangerous.

These are the people who contribute least to the climate crisis yet face its harshest impacts. A day that is too hot to work means a day without income. A week of extreme heat can push families to the brink, forcing impossible choices between food, medicine, and basic necessities. Climate change doesn’t just warm the planet; it deepens the fault lines of inequality, hitting hardest those who already have the fewest resources to cope.

This pattern is not confined to India. Around the world, climate-driven disasters are piling up, each one exposing how unequal and fragile our societies are.

In Brazil, devastating floods have killed 106 people, destroying homes and lives in a matter of hours. In Assam, India, flooding has affected 700,000 people, submerging villages and fields and disrupting livelihoods on a massive scale. In South Africa’s KwaZulu-Natal province, intense rainfall and flooding have brought deadly destruction, sweeping away infrastructure and leaving communities to pick up the pieces.

These events are not isolated tragedies. Together, they form a disturbing picture of a world where extreme weather is becoming more frequent and more intense. Yet too often, governments respond as if this is simply the new normal — something to be endured rather than urgently addressed. Treating escalating heatwaves, floods, and storms as inevitable erases the responsibility to act and abandons those most at risk.

The reality is that climate change and inequality are intertwined. The same systems that drive emissions also concentrate wealth and power, while leaving vulnerable communities exposed to floods, storms, and heatwaves without adequate protection or support. When governments fail to act ambitiously, they are making a choice — a choice that sacrifices the many for the comfort of the few.

This cannot continue. World leaders must confront the climate crisis and the inequality crisis together. That means committing to ambitious climate action that rapidly cuts emissions, while also advancing social equity so that the poorest and most vulnerable are protected and supported.

The unbearable heat in India, the deadly floods in Brazil, the suffering of hundreds of thousands in Assam, and the destruction in KwaZulu-Natal are all warnings. They are also a call to action. Every delay makes the situation more dangerous and more unjust.

People on the frontlines — from Delhi’s roadside vendors to families in flood-hit regions — deserve more than acceptance of disaster as a way of life. They deserve leaders willing to transform our energy systems, strengthen social protections, and put justice at the heart of climate policy.

As the temperatures rise and the waters surge, the choice facing governments is stark: continue down a path where extreme weather and deepening inequality are treated as inevitable, or commit to bold, equitable climate action that protects people and the planet. The time for that commitment is now.
