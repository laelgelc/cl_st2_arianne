The Arctic is in crisis. Sea ice has hit record lows, and the region is warming faster than almost anywhere else on Earth. Yet as the ice disappears, governments and industry are treating the newly opened waters as an opportunity to exploit, rather than a warning to protect.

The European Parliament recently passed a resolution on the Arctic that sounds promising on paper. It acknowledges the urgency of the situation and the need to safeguard this fragile region. But when it comes to concrete action, the resolution falls short. It leans heavily on words and light guidance, instead of pushing for the strong, binding measures that the Arctic so clearly needs.

This gap between rhetoric and reality is especially stark when it comes to fishing. Many EU governments say they support a moratorium on fishing in previously unfished areas of the Arctic Ocean. Yet they still allow fishing fleets to operate in waters that have never before been exploited. If governments recognize that untouched Arctic ecosystems need protection, why are they permitting industrial fishing there at all?

The same pattern appears in the approach to oil. The European Parliament’s resolution could have been a powerful call for a total ban on oil extraction in the Arctic. Instead, oil industry lobbying helped weaken this demand. While the science points clearly toward keeping fossil fuels in the ground, oil interests continue to push for new drilling in one of the most vulnerable regions on Earth.

Around the Arctic, governments are making choices that either lock us into more fossil fuel dependence or help shift us toward a safer future. Norway, for example, is moving ahead with new plans for oil drilling in the Arctic, expanding exploration in areas that should be protected. At the same time, there are signs that public pressure and economic reality are starting to bite: Shell has abandoned its Arctic oil exploration in Alaska, walking away from a high-profile and controversial project. In another important step, Barack Obama and Justin Trudeau declared large parts of the Arctic off-limits to new oil and gas drilling, showing that political leaders can choose protection over extraction.

These contrasting examples underline a simple truth: what happens in the Arctic is a political choice. Governments can either side with the fossil fuel industry or act to protect people and the planet. That means we must press them to do more than make statements. They must halt new fossil fuel projects in the Arctic and rapidly scale up investment in renewable energy. They must back a strong UN oceans treaty that can create real, enforceable protection for Arctic waters. They must ban heavy fuel oil in Arctic shipping, to cut the risk of devastating spills and reduce black carbon pollution that accelerates ice melt. They must support and enforce moratoriums on fishing in previously unfished Arctic areas, giving fragile ecosystems a chance to remain intact.

People around the world have a crucial role to play in demanding this shift. That includes supporting legal efforts to hold governments and companies to account. One powerful example is a court case aimed at stopping new oil rigs in the Arctic, challenging the legality and climate impacts of expanding fossil fuel extraction in a region already under extreme stress.

The Arctic cannot wait for more resolutions filled with fine words but empty of action. With sea ice at record lows and climate impacts escalating, this is the moment to confront our governments, reject the influence of oil lobbies, and insist on real protection: an end to Arctic fossil fuel expansion, serious investment in renewables, strong international rules for the oceans, a ban on heavy fuel oil, and firm moratoriums on destructive fishing. The decisions made now will shape the Arctic — and the global climate — for generations.
