Stretching across North America, Russia, Japan, and Scandinavia, the Boreal Forest is the planet’s largest ecosystem and one of its greatest carbon absorbers. Yet despite its global importance, it remains far less known than other iconic forests, even as it faces mounting threats.

In Canada, the Boreal Forest is under intense pressure from industrial logging. One of the most significant players is Resolute Forest Products, whose operations have serious consequences for both the environment and Indigenous rights. Resolute has been logging in Indigenous territories without consent, undermining the rights and authority of the communities who have lived in and cared for these lands for generations.

This logging also destroys critical habitat for endangered woodland caribou. These animals depend on intact, undisturbed forest landscapes to survive. When logging fragments and degrades their habitat, their already vulnerable populations are pushed closer to the brink.

In 2013, after Greenpeace exposed these harmful practices, Resolute Forest Products responded not by changing course, but by suing Greenpeace and individual staff members for $7 million. This lawsuit was clearly aimed at silencing criticism and deterring public scrutiny of the company’s operations in the Boreal.

The stakes could not be higher. The Boreal Forest plays a vital role in stabilizing the global climate by storing vast amounts of carbon. Its destruction releases that carbon and weakens one of the planet’s most important natural defenses against climate change. Protecting the Boreal is therefore not only a local or national issue, but a global one.

That is why a global movement is needed to defend this forest and stand with the Indigenous Peoples and wildlife that depend on it. The call now is for 100,000 people around the world to #StandForForests and send a clear message to Resolute’s CEO, Richard Garneau. By speaking out directly, people everywhere can help shine a spotlight on what is happening in the Canadian Boreal and demand that Resolute respect Indigenous rights, protect endangered caribou habitat, and stop trying to silence those who raise the alarm.

The Boreal Forest may be lesser known, but it is too important to ignore. Its future depends on what we do today—and whether we choose to stand together to defend it.
