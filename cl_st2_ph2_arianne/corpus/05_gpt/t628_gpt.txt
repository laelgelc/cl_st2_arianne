When Jussa Seurujärvi returns from herding reindeer in the forests of Sápmi, the changes in the land are impossible to ignore. Where reindeer once found enough food beneath the snow, they now increasingly depend on supplemental feeding. Logging, mining, and heavy land use are stripping away the lichen-rich forests and undisturbed pastures that reindeer rely on to survive. For generations, Sámi communities have lived in close connection with these lands through reindeer herding, hunting, and fishing. As the habitat disappears, so too does the foundation of traditions and knowledge that have been passed down over centuries.

The proposed Arctic railway would cut directly through these already pressured landscapes. It would damage reindeer pastures and water systems, and with them, the cultural fabric and identity of the Sámi people. A report has already found the project to be uneconomical and harmful, yet the threat remains. For many Sámi, this is not just another infrastructure plan; it is part of a long pattern of colonization that treats their homeland as empty space to be exploited rather than a living territory with its own peoples, histories, and rights.

Sámi communities are standing firmly against the railway. They are not alone. Thousands of people around the world have joined in solidarity, including Greenpeace and Indigenous groups from Canada and New Zealand. Together, they are pushing back against destructive projects and calling for respect for Sámi rights, lands, and ways of life. Their message is clear: more people are needed in this struggle—to listen, to support, and to help ensure that the forests, waters, and reindeer pastures of Sápmi, and the culture they sustain, are protected for generations to come.
