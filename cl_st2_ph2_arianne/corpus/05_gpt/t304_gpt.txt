Sri Lanka’s shores are facing a heartbreaking new tide: not waves of water, but waves of plastic. In recent days, tons of tiny plastic pellets – the microplastics used to manufacture single-use packaging – have washed ashore near the capital, transforming once-beautiful beaches into toxic, artificial shorelines. Authorities are warning people not to touch them because of their potential toxicity, adding a layer of fear to an already devastating scene.

These pellets did not arrive by accident. They spilled into the ocean after the X-Press Pearl ship caught fire on May 20, following a nitric acid leak onboard. As the fire raged, containers filled with plastic pellets fell overboard, releasing countless pieces of microplastic into the sea. Now they are washing up along the coast, threatening marine life, coastal ecosystems, and the communities who depend on them.

Every one of those pellets represents a failure of a system that treats plastic as cheap and disposable, while offloading the real costs onto people and the planet. This disaster is not just about one ship or one spill. It is a symptom of a global model dominated by fossil fuel and consumer brands that prioritize profit above safety, health, and environmental protection.

Plastic production is tightly bound to fossil fuels, and together they drive pollution, climate change, health problems, and social injustice. Communities on the frontlines – from those living near refineries and plastic plants to coastal fishers watching their waters fill with waste – bear the brunt of this crisis. When plastic pellets blanket a beach in Sri Lanka, it is a visible reminder of a broken system that starts at the oil well and ends in our oceans.

Shipping companies cannot be allowed to treat these cargoes as low-risk commodities. Plastic pellets should be classified and regulated as hazardous materials, with clear International Maritime Dangerous Goods (IMDG) codes that reflect the real risks they pose to marine ecosystems, coastal communities, and workers. Without this, we will continue to see avoidable disasters at sea, followed by hollow promises of cleanup after the damage is already done.

But the responsibility does not stop at shipping companies. Global consumer brands that flood the world with single-use plastic packaging are at the heart of this crisis. Companies like Coca-Cola, Nestlé, and Pepsi have built business models on throwaway plastics, knowing that much of this packaging will end up in landfills, incinerators, or the natural environment.

These brands must move away from single-use plastics and invest in global reuse systems that keep packaging in circulation and out of nature. Reuse is not a niche solution – it is a necessary shift if we are to stop plastic pollution at its source. That means durable, refillable, returnable packaging systems designed for repeated use, supported by policies and infrastructure that make reuse the norm, not the exception.

The disaster unfolding on Sri Lanka’s beaches is a warning. It shows how vulnerable our oceans and communities are when plastic is treated as cheap cargo and disposable waste instead of a dangerous pollutant. Holding shipping companies accountable, classifying plastic pellets as hazardous, and pushing major brands to abandon single-use plastics in favor of reuse systems are all essential steps to prevent future crises.

If we fail to act, the plastic tide will keep rising – pellet by pellet, package by package – until the damage to our oceans, our climate, and our health becomes irreversible.
