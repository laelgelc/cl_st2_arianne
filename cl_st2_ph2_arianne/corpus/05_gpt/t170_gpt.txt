Thirty-six years ago, in the early hours of 26 April 1986, a safety test at reactor 4 of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant went catastrophically wrong. The reactor exploded, releasing massive amounts of radioactivity into the atmosphere. What followed was one of the worst industrial disasters in history: radioactive contamination spread across Ukraine, much of Europe, and beyond, forcing mass evacuations and leaving vast areas uninhabitable for generations to come.

The human, environmental, and economic consequences have been staggering. Entire communities were uprooted and displaced. Farmland, forests, rivers, and cities were contaminated. The costs associated with the Chernobyl disaster have been estimated at around $700 billion, a figure that reflects not only the immediate emergency response and cleanup, but also the long-term economic burden of lost land, health impacts, and ongoing containment and monitoring efforts. Decades later, large exclusion zones remain, a stark reminder that a single accident can render entire regions unsafe.

Yet, despite this history, the nuclear industry continues to promote nuclear power as a safe and green solution to our energy and climate crises. Industry narratives highlight low operational carbon emissions while downplaying or ignoring the scale of potential risks, the unresolved issues of radioactive waste, and the catastrophic consequences when something goes wrong. This promotion is increasingly visible in policy debates, including within the European Union, where there have been moves to include nuclear power in the EU taxonomy for sustainable finance. Labeling nuclear as “sustainable” in such frameworks risks obscuring the lessons of Chernobyl and the full scope of nuclear dangers.

Obfuscation and minimization of risk have long accompanied the nuclear industry. From the initial responses to Chernobyl to more recent lobbying efforts, there is a persistent pattern of underplaying safety concerns and long-term impacts. The push to rebrand nuclear as a clean, green investment opportunity fits this pattern, seeking to secure public money and political support while sidelining the history of accidents and the unresolved legacies they leave behind.

The events of 2022 have cast these risks in an even more alarming light. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has turned nuclear power plants and radioactive sites into potential front lines. Early in the war, Russian forces seized the Chernobyl site, raising global concern about the integrity of its containment structures and the safety of personnel working under military occupation. The occupation underscored how quickly a nuclear facility can become a pawn in armed conflict, with any damage or disruption carrying consequences far beyond national borders.

Even more troubling was the seizure of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the largest in Europe. Military operations in and around an active nuclear plant create unprecedented dangers. Fighting near reactors and spent fuel storage facilities increases the risk of damage to critical safety systems, loss of power, or human error under extreme stress. The potential for a serious incident, whether through direct attack, stray munitions, or operational failures, has brought into focus how fragile nuclear safety becomes in times of war.

These developments in Ukraine show that nuclear power does not exist in a vacuum. Nuclear plants are not just engineering projects; they are embedded in political systems, social tensions, and, as we now see, the realities of armed conflict. Facilities that require absolute stability and security over many decades can suddenly be thrust into chaos by events far beyond the control of their operators. The assumption that nuclear energy can be neatly separated from wider societal and geopolitical risks has been shattered.

On the 36th anniversary of the Chernobyl disaster, the lessons are painfully clear. A single accident can contaminate vast regions, displace communities, and impose economic burdens that last for generations. The costs are not theoretical; they are written into the abandoned towns and poisoned landscapes around Chernobyl. The war in Ukraine has added a new dimension to these dangers, showing how quickly nuclear facilities can become focal points of risk when political stability breaks down.

As debates continue over the future of energy systems and climate policy, it is essential not to erase or soften these realities. Presenting nuclear power as inherently safe or green, or treating it as just another sustainable investment category, ignores the lived experience of Chernobyl and the current threats facing Ukraine’s nuclear facilities. Commemorating this anniversary means refusing to forget what happened in 1986, recognizing the ongoing risks, and insisting that the full history and dangers of nuclear power remain at the center of any discussion about our energy future.
