When we set out for Antarctica, the goal was to witness one of the last great wildernesses on Earth: penguins porpoising through icy waters, whales surfacing in the distance, and vast, pristine landscapes of ice and snow.

What we found instead was a stark reminder that nowhere is untouched by human activity.

Sampling the water around us, we discovered microplastics – tiny fragments and fibres that come from things like packaging and synthetic clothing – drifting in a place that should be as remote from pollution as it gets. These particles are small, but their presence is a clear sign that plastic pollution has spread across the planet, carried by wind and ocean currents to even the cold, southern extremes.

The snow told the same story. Tests revealed hazardous chemicals in snow samples, including freshly fallen snow. That means these pollutants aren’t just lingering in old ice; they are still being deposited today from the atmosphere. Even in Antarctica, far from factories and cities, the footprint of industrial chemicals is visible.

And it wasn’t only what we couldn’t see. As we travelled, we came across visible fishing waste – buoys, nets and other debris – left drifting in the ocean or washed up in the icy environment. These items pose a direct threat to marine life, entangling wildlife and degrading into yet more microplastics over time. Wherever possible, this waste was collected and removed, but what we found is almost certainly just a fraction of what is out there.

All of this in a region that should be a sanctuary for wildlife. Penguins, whales and countless other species depend on the Antarctic Ocean for their survival, yet they are facing a growing tide of pollution and human pressure.

These findings underline a simple truth: cleaning up the mess after it’s made is not enough. To protect places like Antarctica, we have to tackle plastic pollution at its source. That means reducing plastic production and bringing an end to single-use plastics that are used briefly and then persist in the environment for decades or longer.

There is a real opportunity for change. Governments now have the chance to establish an Antarctic Ocean Sanctuary, an area of protection five times the size of Germany. Such a sanctuary would help shield marine life from multiple pressures, including pollution and industrial activity, and give this fragile ecosystem a better chance to recover and thrive.

This proposal is not happening in isolation. It is backed by 1.6 million people who have already raised their voices in support of stronger protection for the Antarctic Ocean. Their message is clear: a remote, icy wilderness should not be a dumping ground for our waste.

The evidence from Antarctica shows that the decisions we make about plastics and ocean protection affect the entire planet. By reducing plastic production, ending single-use plastics, and creating large-scale protected areas like an Antarctic Ocean Sanctuary, governments can help ensure that future expeditions to this extraordinary place find thriving wildlife and clean seas, not a record of our pollution.
