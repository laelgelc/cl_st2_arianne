People head outdoors to get closer to nature, not to carry toxic chemicals into the very landscapes they love. Yet Greenpeace’s Detox Outdoor campaign has shown that many of the products designed for hiking, climbing, and exploring the wild are contaminated with hazardous chemicals that persist in the environment and threaten wildlife and human health.

As part of the campaign, major outdoor brands were surveyed about their use of PFCs (per- and polyfluorinated chemicals) in their products. More than 30,000 people took part in choosing which items should be tested, voting for 40 jackets, trousers, shoes and other gear from well-known companies. Laboratory tests then looked for PFCs in these products.

PFCs were found in all but four of the 40 items tested. Many of these chemicals are used to make products water- and stain-resistant, but they do not break down in nature. Instead, they travel through air and water, reaching even the most remote regions of the planet. From there they can enter food chains, accumulating in wildlife and, ultimately, in people.

Particularly worrying were the high levels of hazardous long-chain PFCs and PFOA detected in gear from major brands such as The North Face and Mammut. These substances are especially persistent and problematic once they are released into the environment. Their presence in products sold to outdoor enthusiasts underlines how deeply these toxic chemicals are embedded in the industry.

The pollution doesn’t stay on the jacket or in the boot. It spreads into rivers, soils and ecosystems, affecting animals and contaminating the places people go to experience clean air and unspoiled nature. The fact that these chemicals are turning up in remote areas shows how far and how fast they can travel once they are released.

But the Detox Outdoor campaign has also highlighted that a different path is possible. UK brand Páramo has committed to Detox, eliminating PFCs entirely from its production. By doing so, it has joined 34 other companies that have already taken this step and shown that outdoor gear can be made without relying on hazardous PFCs.

This contrast exposes a clear choice facing the outdoor industry. Some brands are moving away from toxic chemicals, while others, including big names like Mammut and The North Face, continue to use substances that threaten the very environments their customers seek out.

The outdoor community has a powerful role to play in changing this. By calling on their favourite brands to stop using PFCs and to commit to Detox, hikers, climbers, skiers and nature-lovers can push the industry toward safer, more responsible production. Supporting companies that have already eliminated PFCs, and demanding that others follow, helps protect wildlife, people and the wild places that inspire the love of the outdoors in the first place.
