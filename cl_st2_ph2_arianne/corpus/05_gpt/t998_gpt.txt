In 1996, several of Greenpeace’s early founders gathered in Vancouver to mark 25 years since the organization’s launch in 1971. Dorothy Stowe, Jim Bohlen, Bob Hunter, and Dorothy Metcalfe came together not just to celebrate an anniversary, but to remember how a small group of people, united around a single urgent concern, helped spark a global environmental movement.

They traced Greenpeace’s story back to the “Don’t Make a Wave Committee,” a local group formed in Vancouver to oppose U.S. underground nuclear weapons tests on the island of Amchitka in Alaska. At the time, the tests were seen as a direct threat to people and the environment. The committee’s aim was simple and ambitious: to stop the tests before they happened.

From this committee emerged the idea that would define Greenpeace’s character and strategy: to bear witness directly, at sea, at the site of the testing. The group chartered an old fishing boat, the Phyllis Cormack, and renamed it Greenpeace for the voyage. That first journey toward Amchitka in 1971 was risky, improvised, and underfunded, but it created a powerful new model of environmental action: sailing straight into the heart of a crisis to confront it non-violently, in full view of the world.

The founders recalled how they scraped together the resources to make that voyage possible. Funding came from donations and benefit concerts, reflecting the grassroots nature of the effort. They relied on the support of ordinary people and artists who believed that nuclear testing in a fragile ecosystem was unacceptable. This community backing was essential, not only to get the boat in the water, but to sustain the campaign’s momentum.

Media strategy was central from the beginning. The Amchitka voyage was planned not only as an act of protest, but as a story that could travel far beyond the North Pacific. The group understood that images and eyewitness accounts from the boat could reach newspapers and television, inspiring others and putting pressure on decision-makers. This emphasis on communicating directly with the public became a defining feature of Greenpeace’s work.

Non-violent direct action was another core principle the founders highlighted. By placing themselves in harm’s way without using force, they aimed to expose the dangers of nuclear testing and appeal to the conscience of a global audience. The voyage of the Phyllis Cormack showed how a small, determined crew could confront powerful institutions through peaceful means, while maintaining moral clarity about their purpose.

The founders also spoke about the concrete results of those early efforts. The campaign against the U.S. nuclear tests at Amchitka contributed to the halting of those tests and the subsequent establishment of the area as a nature reserve. This outcome illustrated how persistent public pressure, strategic action, and visible protest could help secure lasting protection for a vulnerable place.

At the same time, they did not romanticize the early years. Internal conflicts were part of the story. Disagreements over strategy, priorities, and direction emerged as the group grew and its work expanded. These tensions reflected both the intensity of their commitment and the challenges of building a new kind of organization while responding to urgent global threats.

From those beginnings—the “Don’t Make a Wave Committee,” the renaming of the Phyllis Cormack as Greenpeace, the reliance on donations and concerts, and the pioneering use of media and non-violent direct action—the founders saw how the organization evolved into an international environmental force. What started as a small group focused on stopping nuclear tests on a remote island developed into a worldwide network addressing a wide range of environmental issues, while still rooted in the tactics and values forged in those first campaigns.

Their reflections in Vancouver in 1996 were a reminder that Greenpeace’s global presence grew out of very specific experiences: a single campaign, a single boat, and a shared determination to confront environmental destruction directly and peacefully, in front of the world.
