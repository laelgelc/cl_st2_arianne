In Manaus, in the heart of Brazil’s Amazon region, Parque das Tribos stands as a powerful reminder that Indigenous peoples are not only forest guardians in distant territories, but also citizens of growing, unequal cities. Founded in 2014, this urban Indigenous neighborhood is home to around 750 families from more than 30 different ethnic groups. Despite its rich cultural diversity, the community faces harsh daily realities: poverty, racism, and a lack of basic infrastructure.

The COVID-19 pandemic intensified these challenges, triggering a hunger crisis that hit Parque das Tribos especially hard. In response, residents organized from within, showing how solidarity and self-determination can fill the gaps left by public policy failures. One of the clearest expressions of this is the Boca da Mata communal kitchen, created by Renata Peixe-Boi.

Boca da Mata does more than put food on the table. It prepares fresh meals that carry deep cultural meaning, using ingredients and recipes that connect people to their territories and traditions. In a time of fear and scarcity, this kitchen became a place of nourishment, dignity, and memory. It also opened up new paths for Indigenous migrant women, who find in this collective work a source of income, mutual support, and recognition of their knowledge. Through the kitchen, women are not only cooking; they are strengthening their leadership and reshaping the community’s social fabric.

At the same time, Boca da Mata helps younger generations reconnect with their roots. As food is prepared and shared, stories are told, and Indigenous languages are spoken and heard. In a city where discrimination and pressure to assimilate are constant, this everyday practice becomes a quiet but powerful act of resistance. It shows that culture is not something frozen in the past, but something that is lived, spoken, and tasted in the present.

Education is another frontline in this struggle for dignity and rights. In Parque das Tribos, Claudia Baré is planning a school that responds to the realities and dreams of Indigenous children growing up in an urban setting. This school aims to affirm their identities, teach them to value their origins, and give them tools to confront prejudice. By centering Indigenous knowledge and experiences, it challenges the idea that being Indigenous is something to be hidden or left behind.

The school also has a protective role. In a context where poverty and exclusion leave children vulnerable to crime and violence, a space dedicated to learning, care, and cultural pride becomes a shield. It offers children another horizon—one where they can see themselves as protagonists of their own stories, rather than as targets of discrimination or recruitment by criminal networks.

Together, initiatives like Boca da Mata and the planned school in Parque das Tribos sketch out a different vision of what cities can be. They show that it is possible to organize life around inclusion, justice, and collective well-being, instead of around profit and exploitation. In these community-led spaces, value is measured not by money, but by shared meals, preserved languages, protected childhoods, and strengthened identities.

Parque das Tribos is more than a neighborhood; it is a living example of alternative futures taking shape in the present. In the face of structural racism and neglect, its residents are building, with their own hands and knowledge, a city that recognizes Indigenous peoples as central to its past, present, and future.
