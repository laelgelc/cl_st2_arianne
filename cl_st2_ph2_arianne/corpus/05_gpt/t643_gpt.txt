A truckload of plastic enters our oceans every minute. That image alone captures the scale of a crisis driven by a throwaway culture built on convenience and corporate profit. Despite decades of promises and greenwashing, only 9% of plastic ever produced has been recycled, while much of the remaining waste is burned, buried, or shipped off and dumped in countries in the global south that did not create this problem in the first place.

Single-use plastics sit at the heart of this crisis. Bottles, wrappers, sachets, and packaging are used for moments but pollute our planet for centuries. Major corporations like Coca-Cola and Nestlé rely on this disposable model to sell more products, faster and cheaper, while offloading the environmental cost onto communities and ecosystems. Instead of meaningfully reducing their throwaway packaging, they continue to flood the world with plastic, knowing full well that most of it will never be recycled.

The same pattern of overconsumption and waste is visible in our gadgets. Technology companies push frequent upgrades, creating a constant churn of devices. Each new launch—like the latest iPhones—encourages people to replace perfectly functional phones, generating mountains of electronic waste. Practices such as deliberately slowing older models make it harder for people to keep using what they already own, nudging them toward unnecessary purchases and deepening the waste problem.

This is why the “right to repair” is so important. When devices are designed to be fixed, upgraded, and used for longer, we reduce the demand for new resources and cut down on e-waste. Repairability gives people real ownership of their products and challenges a system that treats everything, and everyone, as disposable.

On a personal level, many people are turning to ideas like Marie Kondo’s method of decluttering—keeping only what “sparks joy”—to reassess what they own. When we honestly confront the piles of stuff in our homes, we also confront the environmental cost of producing, transporting, and discarding it all. Decluttering can reveal how much of our consumption is driven not by need, but by habit, marketing, and social pressure.

Clothing is a clear example. Fast fashion encourages us to buy more garments than ever, wear them only a few times, and then toss them aside. This model depends on cheap materials and cheap labour, fuelling pollution and exploiting workers. Choosing to repair clothes, wear them longer, swap with friends, or buy second-hand becomes a quiet but powerful act of resistance against this cycle.

Across plastics, electronics, and clothing, the pattern is the same: a system that treats overconsumption as normal and disposability as inevitable. Challenging that system means demanding that corporations cut back on single-use packaging, that tech companies support the right to repair, and that fashion brands move away from fast fashion’s destructive model. It also means rethinking our own relationship with stuff—keeping what truly adds value to our lives, and refusing to accept waste as the cost of convenience.
