Sprite’s lemon juice supplier, La Moraleja S.A., illegally destroyed 3,000 hectares of protected native forests in Argentina to expand lemon production—forests that should have been safeguarded under the country’s 2007 National Forest Law. This destruction has harmed wildlife and weakened vital natural defenses against the climate crisis.

Since 2013, Greenpeace has exposed this deforestation and confronted Sprite and its parent company, Coca-Cola, which publicly claim to have a strong focus on sustainability. The contradiction is clear: while the brand’s image leans on green messaging, its supply chain has been linked to the loss of protected forests.

More than 300,000 people have already demanded action. In response to this sustained pressure, La Moraleja lost its Rainforest Alliance certification and has so far committed to restore 1,400 hectares of the destroyed forest. But that is less than half of the 3,000 hectares that were illegally cleared.

Restoring only part of what was destroyed is not enough. All 3,000 hectares must be fully restored, and Sprite must adopt and enforce a robust zero deforestation policy across its entire supply chain to prevent this from happening again.

People power has already forced change—but we cannot stop halfway. Add your name to the petition calling on Sprite to take full responsibility: demand complete restoration of the 3,000 hectares and a binding, zero deforestation commitment from the company and its suppliers.
