The first week of COP27 in Sharm el-Sheikh has left many people frustrated and worried about the pace and direction of global climate action. Instead of moving quickly to protect people and the planet, negotiations have been slowed by delays in funding discussions and by richer nations still failing to deliver on their long-promised $100 billion a year in climate finance for developing countries.

This failure is not just about broken promises; it has real consequences for communities already living with the impacts of climate change. At COP27, the countries most responsible for the climate crisis have been blocking the creation of a dedicated Loss and Damage Finance Facility. Such a facility is urgently needed to support countries facing devastating climate impacts they did little to cause, from extreme weather to slow-onset disasters.

So far, negotiations have too often sidelined the needs of people and the planet. The final COP27 outcome must be clear about what is driving the crisis: fossil fuels. The text cannot shy away from naming fossil fuels as the root cause and must include a strong commitment to adequate, predictable financing so countries can transition away from them and cope with climate impacts.

Despite the overall frustration, there have been some important positive developments. For the first time, Loss and Damage has made it onto the official agenda, a crucial step after years of demands from vulnerable countries and civil society. France has called for a ban on deep sea mining, reflecting growing concern about the environmental risks of opening up a new frontier for extraction in fragile ocean ecosystems. Support is also growing for a global phase-out of fossil fuels, adding momentum to calls for a rapid transition to clean energy.

Civil society has played a vital role in pushing these issues forward. Protests at COP27 have highlighted the urgency of climate justice and kept pressure on governments to act in line with science and equity. At the same time, the presence of 600 fossil fuel lobbyists has been exposed, underscoring how strongly the interests of polluting industries are still represented in climate talks and how they can undermine ambition.

There have also been serious setbacks. An agreement made during the negotiations allows another decade of forest destruction. Forests are essential for storing carbon, protecting biodiversity and supporting Indigenous Peoples and local communities, so extending the timeline for their destruction moves the world in the wrong direction at a time when action should be accelerating.

As the talks move into their next phase, governments have a clear choice. They can continue to delay real action, or they can listen to those on the frontlines of the climate crisis, confront the fossil fuel industry’s influence, and deliver a final COP27 outcome that names fossil fuels, secures adequate finance, protects forests and ecosystems, and responds to the growing demand for climate justice.
