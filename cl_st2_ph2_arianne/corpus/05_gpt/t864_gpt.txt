Greenpeace has launched a petition calling on Samsung to ensure that the 4.3 million recalled Galaxy Note7 phones are reused or recycled, rather than wasted. These devices contain valuable materials and components that could be recovered, and the scale of the recall means Samsung’s decision will have a significant environmental impact.

The call has already attracted global media attention and more than 25,000 people have signed the petition. In response, Samsung has acknowledged the concerns raised and has said it is reviewing options to minimize the environmental impact of the recalled phones. However, the company has not yet shared any public plans about what it intends to do with them.

Because there is still no clear commitment from Samsung, it is important to increase public pressure. One way to do this is by phoning Samsung directly and asking specific questions:

- What are Samsung’s plans for the 4.3 million recalled Galaxy Note7 phones?
- Will Samsung recycle or reuse the components and materials?
- If no plans currently exist, when will Samsung announce a timeline for deciding and sharing them?

After contacting Samsung, people are encouraged to share the company’s responses on social media using the hashtag #SaveTheGalaxy. By publicly raising these questions and amplifying the answers, it can help push Samsung to rethink how phones are designed, produced, and how their materials are reused at the end of their life.
