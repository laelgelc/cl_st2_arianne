Greenpeace is mourning the recent passing of Dr. Roger Grace in New Zealand, a renowned underwater photographer whose work and spirit have left a lasting legacy within the organization and the wider ocean protection movement.

Dr. Grace first joined Greenpeace aboard the Rainbow Warrior II in 1990, taking part in its inaugural campaign against drift netters in the Tasman Sea. This early collaboration set the tone for many years of shared work at sea, where his images helped bring the hidden world beneath the waves to the surface of public consciousness.

Over the decades, he sailed on numerous Greenpeace expeditions, including voyages to Antarctica and the Pacific tuna campaign. On these journeys, his photography documented both the beauty of marine ecosystems and the threats they face, contributing powerfully to Greenpeace’s efforts to protect the oceans.

A classical photographer, Dr. Grace worked with minimal equipment, relying on his skill, patience, and understanding of the sea to capture iconic underwater images. His pictures reflected not only technical mastery but also a profound love for marine life and a deep commitment to its protection.

Through his collaboration with Greenpeace and his lifelong dedication to the oceans, Dr. Roger Grace helped inspire countless people to care about the underwater world. His images, and the passion behind them, will continue to support the struggle to defend marine life for years to come.
