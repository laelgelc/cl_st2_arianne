Zara’s commitment to eliminate all hazardous chemical discharges from its supply chain and products by 2020 marks a turning point in the fight against toxic pollution from the fashion industry. After just nine days of intense public pressure from Greenpeace’s Detox campaign, the world’s largest clothing retailer agreed to phase out PFCs (per- and polyfluorinated chemicals) by 2015 and to roll out measures that begin to address the problem at its source: the factories where clothes are made.

This commitment is not only about what goes into Zara’s clothes, but also what comes out of the pipes of its suppliers. A key part of the pledge is transparency. By 2013, 100 of Zara’s suppliers in the Global South are required to publicly disclose data on the hazardous chemicals they release. This kind of information is crucial for communities living near production sites, who often face the direct consequences of industrial pollution, and for consumers who want to know the real environmental cost of their clothing.

The Detox campaign that led to Zara’s decision was global in scope and energy. Actions took place at Zara stores around the world, turning shopfronts into focal points for public demand for a toxic-free fashion industry. Online, the pressure was amplified by people using social media to call on the brand to act, generating over 43,800 Twitter mentions. This combination of on-the-ground protests and digital mobilisation showed Zara that its customers and the wider public would not accept business as usual.

Zara’s move places it alongside other major brands, such as Nike and Adidas, that have already committed to detoxing their supply chains. Together, these decisions send a strong signal to the rest of the sector: eliminating hazardous chemicals is both necessary and achievable. Yet the scale of the problem means that a handful of leading brands is not enough. The toxic pollution linked to clothing production will only be stopped when many more companies follow suit, take responsibility for their supply chains, and commit to a future where fashion is free from hazardous chemicals.
