A single student deciding to act in the face of the climate emergency has grown into one of the largest climate actions the world has ever seen. From that first act of courage, school strikes for climate have spread across continents, inspiring young people everywhere to step out of their classrooms and into the streets to demand a livable future.

Today, students are striking in countries as diverse and far apart as Vietnam, Kenya, Russia, Kosovo, Solomon Islands, Canada, Seychelles, Pakistan, Antarctica, Afghanistan, and Bangladesh. Each new strike adds another powerful voice, another place on the map where young people refuse to stay silent while their future is put at risk.

In cities like Kabul, Moscow, Karachi, and Ho Chi Minh, students are taking to the streets with extraordinary bravery. They raise their signs and their voices in contexts that can be especially challenging, yet they continue to show up, week after week. Their determination has produced iconic images that circle the globe, reminding everyone that the climate crisis is already here, and that those who will live longest with its consequences are standing up right now.

With every strike, the movement grows. New locations join in, new students find the courage to act, and the call for climate justice becomes louder and harder to ignore. This is more than a series of protests; it is a global demand for a better planet for future generations.

This is a tribute to those young heroes. Their courage, persistence, and hope are a powerful answer to the climate emergency. They are showing the world what it means to fight for the future, and their message is clear: everyone, everywhere, must join in and do their part to protect the Earth for the generations to come.
