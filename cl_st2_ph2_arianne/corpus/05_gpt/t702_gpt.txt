Across the world, Greenpeace offices are witnessing how extreme weather is reshaping lives, landscapes, and communities. In Japan, Germany, Denmark, Switzerland, and Korea, heatwaves have pushed temperatures to unprecedented levels, with some breaking records. These are not isolated events, but part of a disturbing pattern of intensifying extremes.

The impacts are stark. In Russia, Greece, and California, these extreme heatwaves have contributed to devastating forest fires. Entire regions have been engulfed in flames, affecting millions of people and leading to tragic loss of life. Homes, livelihoods, and ecosystems have been destroyed, leaving communities to face the long and painful process of recovery.

At the same time, flooding is becoming more frequent and severe. In southern France and India, rising waters have inundated towns and villages, damaging infrastructure and displacing people. These floods are another face of the same crisis, demonstrating how climate impacts can swing from one extreme to another.

In the Philippines, a powerful storm has revealed yet another dimension of the problem: the intersection of climate change and plastic pollution. As the storm hit, plastic waste clogged drains, worsening flooding, and was washed back onto shores. The result was coastlines and communities choked with rubbish, showing how our dependence on single-use plastics and fossil fuels is deepening environmental and social harms.

These events underline a clear reality: climate change does not respect borders. From Europe to Asia to the Americas, its impacts are being felt in every region. The science and the lived experience both point to the same conclusion: we must limit global warming to 1.5°C, as agreed under the Paris Agreement, to reduce the risk of even more dangerous and irreversible damage.

Achieving this means confronting the root cause of the crisis: our reliance on fossil fuels. It requires curbing fossil fuel use, ending the expansion of coal, and halting public and private funding for coal projects and fossil fuel pipelines. Every new coal plant and every new pipeline pushes us further away from the 1.5°C pathway and locks in more extreme weather for decades to come.

But there is also power in collective action. Around the world, people are documenting what they see: scorched forests, flooded streets, plastic-strewn coastlines, and communities under strain. By sharing these images and stories, they are helping to build pressure on governments and corporations to act in line with the Paris Agreement, phase out fossil fuels, and support a just transition to safer, renewable energy systems.

The crises unfolding in Japan, Germany, Denmark, Switzerland, Korea, Russia, Greece, California, southern France, India, and the Philippines are connected. They are all signals of a world warming too fast. By acting together, holding decision-makers to account, and insisting on the 1.5°C limit, we can still change course and protect people and the planet from even more severe consequences.
