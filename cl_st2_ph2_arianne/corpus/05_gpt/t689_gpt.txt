Corporate power has grown to a point where it can shape government policies and weaken international human rights protections. This influence is especially visible when corporations harm communities and the environment yet manage to avoid accountability, often by exploiting gaps in national laws and international frameworks. In this context, legal strategies have become a crucial tool for challenging abuses and pushing back against corporate impunity.

Greenpeace has increasingly turned to the law as a means to hold powerful actors to account. Legal action can expose how corporate decisions harm human rights and the environment, and it can force governments and companies to answer for their roles. Using courts, legal complaints, and human rights mechanisms, Greenpeace and allies work to close the distance between corporate decision-making and the people and ecosystems affected by it. These efforts are part of a broader movement to ensure that human rights are not subordinated to corporate interests.

A key development in this struggle is the proposed binding treaty on business and human rights, which is currently being negotiated at the international level. The so‑called “zero draft” of this treaty marks a significant step forward compared to the situation in 1992, when there was no consensus on how to deal with corporate human rights abuses across borders. At that time, the idea that international law should directly tackle corporate responsibility for human rights impacts had little traction. Today, the very existence of a draft treaty reflects a growing recognition that voluntary standards are not enough.

The zero draft puts forward several important advances. It requires corporate due diligence, meaning that companies would have to identify, prevent, and address human rights harms linked to their operations. It also extends liability beyond a company’s headquarters to include subsidiaries and suppliers, recognising that abuses often occur deeper in corporate structures and supply chains. Another notable feature is that it would allow lawsuits to be brought in multiple jurisdictions, making it harder for companies to hide behind complex corporate arrangements or operate in countries where victims have little chance of obtaining justice.

At the same time, the draft has serious limitations. Its scope is restricted to transnational corporations, even though domestic companies can also cause severe human rights and environmental harms. The draft does not create direct legal obligations for businesses themselves; instead, it relies on states to regulate and enforce. It also does not spell out which specific human rights are protected, leaving important gaps and room for interpretation. Crucially, it fails to address corporate privileges embedded in mechanisms such as investor–state dispute settlement (ISDS), which companies have used to challenge public-interest regulations, including those aimed at protecting people and the environment.

These shortcomings show that the work is far from finished. States now have a responsibility to strengthen the treaty so that it can genuinely transform how corporate power is governed and how human rights are protected. That means expanding its scope, clarifying the rights at stake, and ensuring that corporate privileges do not override the public’s right to a healthy environment and a dignified life.

Achieving a robust binding treaty on business and human rights will not happen without pressure from the outside. Collective action by social movements, affected communities, civil society organisations, and concerned individuals is essential to counterbalance corporate influence over governments and international negotiations. By mobilising together, it is possible to push states to close the gaps in the zero draft and to advance a global system where corporate abuses are met with real accountability, not impunity.
