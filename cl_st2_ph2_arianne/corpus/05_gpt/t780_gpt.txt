Greenpeace’s report “Justice for People and Planet” brings together 20 case studies that document how corporate activities have caused serious harm to both human rights and the environment. These cases cover abuses such as deforestation, pollution, and violations of Indigenous rights. Across very different sectors and regions, a common pattern emerges: companies are able to cause or contribute to harm because of major gaps in the way the global economy is governed.

The report links these abuses to governance gaps in global economic rules that have been shaped by political choices over time. Rather than being accidental, these gaps reflect decisions that allow corporate interests to overshadow the rights of people and the protection of the environment. Corporate capture of public institutions plays a key role: when corporations exert disproportionate influence over rule‑making and enforcement, laws and policies can be weakened, delayed, or designed in ways that favour profit over accountability.

In response, Greenpeace sets out 10 Principles for Corporate Accountability. These principles aim to reorient economic rules so that people and the environment come before corporate interests. They call for binding rules rather than voluntary commitments, and for clear obligations on companies to identify, prevent, and address harm throughout their operations and supply chains. Due diligence is central: corporations should be required to assess and manage risks to human rights and the environment, not only risks to their own reputation or financial performance.

The principles also stress the need for transparency so that communities, workers, and the public can know what companies are doing and how decisions are made. Liability is another key element: when corporations cause or contribute to harm, there must be clear pathways to hold them legally accountable. This connects directly to access to remedy, ensuring that affected people and communities can seek justice and obtain redress. Strong enforcement mechanisms are essential so that rules have real consequences and are not treated as optional.

While the report exposes serious corporate misdeeds, it also highlights that change is possible. It points to positive examples where governments have begun to put stronger rules in place. In France, risk prevention laws require companies to take responsibility for identifying and addressing risks in their activities and supply chains. In Switzerland, a national referendum put corporate responsibility and accountability on the political agenda, reflecting public demand for stronger protections. In the United Kingdom, the Modern Slavery Act established obligations related to forced labour and exploitation in supply chains.

These examples show that binding measures can be implemented and that public pressure and political will can start to close governance gaps. Greenpeace’s approach in the report is not only to criticise harmful corporate behaviour, but also to acknowledge positive corporate actions where they occur and to offer concrete alternatives. By combining detailed case studies of abuse with a clear set of principles and examples of emerging laws, “Justice for People and Planet” argues for a shift from voluntary corporate responsibility to enforceable corporate accountability that prioritises human rights and environmental protection.
