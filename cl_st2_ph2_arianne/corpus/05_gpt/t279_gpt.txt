Aldabra Atoll is more than a remote ring of coral in the Indian Ocean; for 23-year-old Seychellois conservationist Emma Mederic, it is both a home for unique wildlife and a frontline in the struggle to protect our oceans.

As Assistant Aldabra Science Coordinator with the Seychelles Islands Foundation (SIF), Emma works on one of the world’s most remarkable marine World Heritage Sites. Aldabra is a UNESCO-listed atoll and a natural laboratory, where life thrives in a relatively undisturbed state. It is home to an extraordinary array of species, including giant tortoises roaming the islands, green turtles nesting along the beaches, and elusive dugongs moving through its waters.

SIF has managed Aldabra since 1979, building on the foundation laid by the atoll’s research station, established in 1971. That station is central to understanding and protecting Aldabra: it supports evidence-based conservation, where decisions are grounded in long-term monitoring and scientific data rather than guesswork. This approach is crucial in a rapidly changing climate, where impacts on species and ecosystems must be carefully tracked and understood.

Emma’s work reflects another important evolution at Aldabra: growing gender diversity in conservation. The research station and field teams now include women in roles that were once almost entirely male-dominated, and Aldabra has even hosted all-female teams. These teams are not only collecting data and carrying out demanding fieldwork; they are also reshaping what leadership in conservation looks like and who is seen as a protector of the planet.

But even a place as remote and protected as Aldabra is not safe from global threats. Emma sees the atoll facing the pressures of climate change, pollution, and unsustainable fisheries. Rising temperatures, changes in ocean conditions, and human impacts beyond Aldabra’s boundaries all pose risks to the species and ecosystems that make the atoll so special.

From her vantage point on Aldabra, Emma is clear about what needs to happen. She urges people everywhere to reduce their ecological footprints and to push for an end to fossil fuels, which drive the climate crisis affecting even the most isolated places on Earth. She also calls for support for a strong Global Ocean Treaty to safeguard biodiversity in the high seas, beyond national jurisdictions. Protecting Aldabra, she emphasizes, is inseparable from protecting the wider ocean that connects us all.
