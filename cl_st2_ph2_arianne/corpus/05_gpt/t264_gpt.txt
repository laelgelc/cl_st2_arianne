The climate crisis is here, it is real, and it is already reshaping lives and ecosystems across the planet. But it is not inevitable that this story ends in catastrophe. Around the world, communities – especially Indigenous peoples and grassroots movements – are showing that resistance, courage, and collective action can still change the course we are on.

Stopping pipelines and other fossil fuel infrastructure is one of the clearest and most urgent fronts in this struggle. Indigenous-led resistance has repeatedly shown its power to delay, disrupt, and stop dangerous projects that lock us into decades more of oil and gas dependence. Supporting these movements is essential: every pipeline stopped is pollution prevented, land and water protected, and a step closer to a different future.

To keep any hope of a safe climate, global emissions must fall to zero, and that means cutting them in half by 2030. This is not a vague aspiration; it is a concrete milestone on the path to staying within the 1.5°C limit that scientists and frontline communities have identified as a critical guardrail. Government targets must be aligned with this limit, not with the interests of polluting industries. International climate talks, including COP26, are key moments when governments can either reinforce the status quo or choose to act at the scale and speed the crisis demands.

Financial institutions have a decisive role to play. Banks, insurers, and investors must stop pouring money into coal, oil, and gas and instead commit to genuine divestment from fossil fuels. That means no more greenwashing, no more vague “net zero by 2050” pledges that allow business as usual to continue today. Financial flows must be rapidly redirected towards real climate solutions, not false fixes that prolong dependence on fossil fuels.

The food system is another major driver of the crisis, and it must be transformed. Ending deforestation is essential, both to protect biodiversity and to keep huge amounts of carbon in forests and other ecosystems. At the same time, shifting towards more plant-based diets can significantly reduce emissions, relieve pressure on land, and improve resilience. A food system that respects planetary boundaries and human rights is a core part of a livable future.

Transport must also change fundamentally. Transforming how we move – away from fossil-fuelled cars, trucks, ships, and planes and towards cleaner, more efficient, and more equitable systems – is a crucial pillar of climate action. This transformation is not only about technology; it is about redesigning our economies and communities so that people, not polluters, are at the center.

Protecting nature is both a moral responsibility and a climate necessity. At least 30% of the world’s ecosystems need to be effectively protected to safeguard biodiversity, stabilize the climate, and support the livelihoods of communities who depend on them. This protection must go hand in hand with upholding Indigenous rights. Indigenous peoples are among the most effective guardians of forests, oceans, and other ecosystems, and their leadership and land rights are essential for real conservation.

Even with rapid cuts in emissions, climate impacts are already here and will intensify. Preparing for these impacts must be done justly, guided by the polluter pays principle. Those who have contributed most to the crisis must bear the greatest responsibility for addressing the damage. Communities on the frontlines of floods, droughts, storms, and sea-level rise need support and resources, not empty promises.

Solidarity is not optional. Climate finance is a concrete expression of that solidarity, enabling countries and communities with fewer resources to adapt, recover from losses and damages, and pursue clean development pathways. Ensuring fair, adequate, and accessible climate finance is a cornerstone of global climate justice.

All of this requires a just transition away from fossil fuels. That means no new investments in coal, oil, or gas, and a planned, fair phase-out of existing production and use. Workers and communities currently dependent on fossil fuel industries must be supported with new opportunities, social protections, and a say in shaping their futures. A just transition is about transforming economies so that they serve people and the planet, not fossil fuel profits.

The COVID-19 pandemic has shown how quickly societies can change when faced with an emergency. Recovery plans offer a once-in-a-generation chance to break with fossil fuel dependence and build a green, fair, and resilient future instead. Rather than bailing out polluters, governments can invest in renewable energy, sustainable transport, ecosystem protection, and resilient public services.

None of this will happen without people power. From Indigenous land defenders to youth climate strikers, from local communities to global movements, it is collective action that forces governments and corporations to move. The climate crisis is urgent, but it is also a call to solidarity, courage, and imagination. By stopping pipelines, cutting emissions in half by 2030, aligning policies with 1.5°C, transforming food and transport, protecting ecosystems and rights, and demanding a just, green recovery, people everywhere can help turn the tide.
