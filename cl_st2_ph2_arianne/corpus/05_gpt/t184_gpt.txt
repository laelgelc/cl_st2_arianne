Human-induced climate change and the war in Ukraine share a common root: our global dependence on fossil fuels. As Ukrainian scientist Svitlana Krakovska has pointed out, this dependency not only drives the climate crisis but also helps to fuel wars and geopolitical instability.

Fossil fuels still make up more than 80% of the world’s energy supply. This concentration of power in coal, oil, and gas has created deep geopolitical imbalances. Countries rich in these resources often wield disproportionate influence, while others become vulnerable and dependent. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is one of the starkest recent examples of how fossil fuel resources and revenues can underpin aggression and conflict.

Fossil fuel companies are profiting from crises and conflict, even as people suffer on the frontlines of war and climate impacts. These companies benefit from price spikes and volatility, turning instability into record-breaking earnings. While communities face destroyed homes, rising food prices, and escalating climate disasters, the fossil fuel industry continues to cash in.

To build both peace and climate security, governments must move to phase out fossil fuels immediately. This means cutting demand as well as supply. Reducing energy demand through efficiency—using less energy to deliver the same services—is one of the fastest ways to weaken the grip of fossil fuels. At the same time, the world must rapidly transition to renewable energy sources.

Renewables like wind and solar can be installed far more quickly than new fossil fuel infrastructure. They are increasingly cheaper than coal, oil, and gas in many regions. Crucially, they are less prone to the kinds of power struggles that erupt over concentrated, finite resources. A world powered by distributed renewable energy is less vulnerable to coercion, blackmail, and war financed by fossil fuel revenues.

In the context of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, this means divesting from Russian fossil fuels and imposing embargoes on them. Cutting off the flow of money from fossil fuel purchases undermines the financial basis for aggression. At the same time, governments must provide humanitarian aid to people affected by the war, supporting refugees and communities under attack.

History is full of conflicts linked to oil and gas, and once again, fossil fuel companies are exploiting a crisis for profit. This pattern—war, instability, soaring prices, and windfall fossil fuel profits—will continue as long as the world’s energy system is built on coal, oil, and gas.

Breaking this cycle is essential. By rapidly reducing fossil fuel use, boosting efficiency, and scaling up renewable energy, governments can help protect the climate, reduce the risk of future wars, and stand in solidarity with people whose lives are being torn apart by both conflict and climate change.
