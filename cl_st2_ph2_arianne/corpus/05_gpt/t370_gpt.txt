In 2020, as many of us adjusted to COVID-19 safety measures and the sudden shift to working from home, a quieter story unfolded on our streets, rails, and bus routes. While some people could stay inside and log in from their kitchen tables, countless others still had to leave home every day. Many of these frontline workers did not have cars. They relied on one thing to reach hospitals, care homes, supermarkets, warehouses, and other essential workplaces: public transport.

For a long time, our societies have treated cars and planes as the ultimate symbols of freedom. Advertisements and political decisions alike have reinforced the idea that real independence comes with a steering wheel or a boarding pass. In that story, buses, trams, and trains often fade into the background—seen as second best, or just “for those who have no choice.”

But mobility is not a luxury; it is a lifeline. It is how people get to jobs that keep our communities functioning. It is how shelves are stocked, patients are cared for, and vital services are staffed. It is also a matter of fairness. When access to safe, affordable transport is unequal, so is access to opportunity, income, and care.

The COVID-19 crisis made this reality impossible to ignore. It reminded us that strong public services are not optional extras. Investing in them is essential if we want societies that can withstand shocks, protect the vulnerable, and support everyone—not just those with the means to opt out.

Behind every bus that still ran, every tram that still arrived, and every train that still pulled into the station during the hardest months of the pandemic, there were people. Drivers and ticket sellers. Technicians and operators. Cleaners, maintenance crews, and office workers. They adapted to new safety rules, kept services running, and made it possible for others to do their jobs.

Many of them did this quietly, without fanfare, during long shifts and, for some, during the holidays—times when most people hope to be with friends and family. Their work kept communities moving when so much else had come to a halt.

Recognising their contribution is not only about gratitude in a moment of crisis. It is about rethinking what and who we value. When we talk about freedom and mobility, we need to remember that the ability to move safely and affordably is a shared good, sustained by shared systems and the people who operate them.

So this is a simple message of thanks to public transport workers everywhere: drivers, ticket sellers, technicians, operators, cleaners, maintenance staff, and office workers. Thank you for keeping communities running. Thank you for making sure those without cars could still reach the places they were needed most. Thank you for keeping us moving—especially during the holidays, when your work is so often invisible yet so deeply felt.
