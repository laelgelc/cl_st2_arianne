As the world watched athletes push the limits of human performance at the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, something just as important was happening behind the scenes: a visible commitment to cleaner energy. Six Olympic venues were powered by renewable sources, and the organisers set a target of zero emissions for the Games. In a world where climate disruption is already changing the face of winter, that mattered.

Winter sports are on the frontline of the climate crisis. Rising temperatures and unpredictable weather are shrinking the season for snow and ice. Melting snow is forcing athletes to travel farther and farther in search of reliable training conditions, sometimes crossing continents just to find the cold that used to be guaranteed closer to home. A study has already warned that nine cities which have previously hosted – or are due to host – the Winter Olympics may soon become too warm to stage the Games safely and fairly. The very stage on which winter athletes perform is literally disappearing.

That’s why the clean energy efforts in Pyeongchang were more than a technical detail; they were a signal of what is possible when organisers take climate science seriously. But while the Olympic movement is beginning to recognise its responsibility, some of its biggest corporate sponsors are still lagging dangerously behind.

Samsung, one of the most prominent sponsors associated with the Winter Games, has seen its greenhouse gas emissions rise by 55% since 2010. At the same time, only 1% of the energy it uses comes from renewable sources. This stands in stark contrast to the futuristic, innovation-driven image the company promotes through its marketing. Its taglines promise a bold, cutting‑edge vision of tomorrow, yet its energy choices remain rooted in the fossil‑fuel past that is driving the climate crisis.

This disconnect cannot continue. If companies want to be associated with global celebrations of human achievement like the Olympics, they must also be prepared to meet the global challenge of our time: stabilising the climate. The CEOs of Samsung have the power to change course, shifting their vast operations onto clean, renewable energy and helping to protect the winters that athletes – and communities around the world – depend on. The world has already seen that a cleaner Olympics is possible. Now it’s time for major sponsors to match that ambition with real action.
