In 2022, communities, advocates, and decision-makers around the world pushed back against environmental destruction and won important protections for people and the planet.

In the Philippines, the Commission on Human Rights made a landmark declaration that climate change is a human rights issue. By explicitly linking climate impacts to human rights, the Commission also held corporations accountable for their role in the climate crisis. This recognition strengthens the case for justice for communities already facing climate-related harm.

In Europe, the EU took steps to better protect those who speak out. A proposed law against Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation (SLAPPs) aims to shield advocates, journalists, and campaigners from abusive legal tactics designed to silence criticism and participation in public debates on environmental and other issues.

At the global level, the UN General Assembly affirmed that everyone has the right to a clean, healthy, and sustainable environment. This recognition by the world’s governments helps anchor environmental protection in the broader framework of human rights and can guide future laws and policies.

In the United States, California moved to protect communities living on the frontlines of fossil fuel extraction by banning new oil and gas wells near where people live and work. This step is intended to reduce exposure to pollution and health risks in neighborhoods long burdened by drilling.

The European Union adopted a deforestation law that requires companies to ensure products placed on the EU market are not linked to forest destruction. A key part of this is supply chain traceability, which compels companies to know and show where their commodities come from, helping to curb deforestation tied to global trade.

In Canada, authorities rejected an expansion of an iron mine in the Arctic to protect Inuit lands. This decision recognized the importance of safeguarding Indigenous territories and the fragile Arctic environment from industrial expansion.

Across the world, momentum grew for protecting the oceans as more governments, scientists, and organizations called for a moratorium on deep sea mining. These calls reflect rising concern about the potential impacts of mining on vulnerable deep ocean ecosystems.

At the United Nations, governments agreed on a resolution to negotiate a global treaty on plastics. This resolution opened the door to international rules aimed at tackling plastic pollution across its life cycle, from production to disposal.

Courts also played a crucial role in 2022. In Argentina and South Africa, legal challenges succeeded in stopping or restraining oil exploration, reflecting growing scrutiny of fossil fuel projects. In Indonesia, a court victory affirmed people’s right to clean air, strengthening legal grounds for action against harmful pollution.

Taken together, these developments showed that progress is possible: human rights bodies, lawmakers, communities, and courts all contributed to concrete steps toward environmental protection and justice in 2022.
