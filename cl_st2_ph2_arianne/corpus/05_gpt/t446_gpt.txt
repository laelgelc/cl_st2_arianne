The COVID-19 crisis has laid bare how fragile and unequal our current socio-economic systems are. It has revealed just how deeply interdependent we are, and how vulnerable many communities become when supply chains falter, public health systems are strained, and social safety nets prove inadequate. At the same time, it has opened a window to rethink how we live, work, produce, and care for one another and the planet.

This moment invites a green and just transition toward practices that are resilient and operate within ecological limits. That means moving away from extractive, profit-driven models and towards systems that prioritise collective well-being, environmental integrity, and democratic participation. Central to this shift is the idea of the commons: shared resources managed collectively by a community according to rules and norms they create together.

Commons-based approaches can reshape production, consumption, work, and ownership. They are already visible in concrete examples such as Wikipedia, where knowledge is created and maintained collaboratively and made freely available to all. Community-supported agriculture shows how food systems can be organised around direct, trust-based relationships between producers and consumers, sharing risks and benefits. During the pandemic, open-source initiatives demonstrated how collaboration and open access to designs, data, and tools can accelerate responses to urgent needs.

Commons are not just about sharing resources; they are about embedding care, openness, collaboration, and a sense of abundance into the heart of our economies. Models such as distributed manufacturing and open access licensing point toward production systems that are more local, flexible, and less wasteful, while still being globally connected through shared knowledge. Distributed Cooperative Organizations (DisCOs) and platform cooperatives illustrate how digital infrastructures can be designed to serve workers and communities rather than distant shareholders, ensuring that value created collectively is also governed and shared collectively. Farmland trusts offer another pathway, protecting land from speculation and managing it in the long-term interest of communities and ecosystems.

These commons-oriented practices do not stand alone. They complement and intersect with broader movements such as degrowth and ecofeminism. Degrowth challenges the obsession with endless economic expansion and calls for scaling down resource use while improving quality of life and equity. Ecofeminism highlights how systems of domination over nature are intertwined with systems of domination over marginalised groups, especially women, and foregrounds care, relationality, and justice.

Together, commons-based models, degrowth, and ecofeminism point toward fairer and more participatory alternatives to the status quo. They help us imagine and build economies where resilience is rooted in cooperation, where production and consumption respect ecological boundaries, and where care—for people and the planet—is recognised as central rather than peripheral. The disruptions of COVID-19 make it clear that returning to “normal” is neither possible nor desirable. Instead, they offer a powerful impetus to transform our systems so they can sustain life, dignity, and justice in a warming, uncertain world.
