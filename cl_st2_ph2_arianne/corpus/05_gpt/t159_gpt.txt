At the African Energy Summit in London, activists interrupted business as usual to call out what they describe as a new wave of neo-colonial exploitation: foreign oil companies extracting fossil fuels in Africa while communities on the ground bear the costs.

At the heart of their protest is Canadian company ReconAfrica and its plans to drill in the Kavango region of Namibia and Botswana, an area that includes the Okavango Delta. This fragile landscape is home to extraordinary biodiversity and endangered species such as cheetahs and rhinos. It also supports local tourism and sustains Indigenous communities, including the San people, whose livelihoods and cultural survival are closely tied to the land and water.

Activists warn that the project could have far-reaching climate consequences. The oil development is linked to potential carbon emissions on a scale that could consume around one-sixth of the remaining global carbon budget. That would push the world further off track from the Paris Agreement’s temperature goals, deepening the climate crisis that already hits formerly colonized nations hardest.

Beyond climate impacts, there are serious concerns about local water supplies and the broader ecological integrity of the region. The Okavango Delta is a lifeline in a largely arid landscape. Any contamination or disruption could devastate wildlife, undermine tourism revenues, and threaten the basic survival of nearby communities.

Youth and Indigenous activists, including Namibian campaigner Ina-Marie Shikongo and Q7 Beckett, are demanding that ReconAfrica’s plans be stopped. They highlight a lack of meaningful consultation with affected communities and warn of the irreversible damage that drilling could cause. Their message at the summit is clear: decisions about African lands, waters, and futures must not be driven by distant corporate interests at the expense of people, nature, and climate stability.
