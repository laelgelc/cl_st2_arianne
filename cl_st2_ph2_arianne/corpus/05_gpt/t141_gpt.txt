For 16 years, communities along the Rio Manicoré in the Brazilian Amazon have been fighting for the right to protect their home and manage it sustainably. Around 4,000 people live in this region, and their lives are deeply tied to the forest that surrounds them. After years of organizing, resistance, and negotiation, they have finally secured a major victory: a collective use concession (CDRU) over 3,899.32 km² of forest.

This concession is a crucial step toward creating a Sustainable Development Reserve (RDS) in the region. An RDS is a type of protected area designed to conserve forests while allowing traditional communities to use resources in ways that are sustainable and compatible with forest protection. For the people of Rio Manicoré, this means the possibility of securing their land rights, protecting their territories from invasions, and building a future that doesn’t depend on forest destruction.

But this victory is not the end of the struggle. Without proper implementation, a CDRU on paper will not be enough to stop the forces driving deforestation. Land grabbing, illegal logging, mining, and the expansion of cattle ranching continue to advance over undesignated forests in the Amazon. These are public lands that have not yet been formally allocated for conservation, Indigenous territories, or other uses, and they are especially vulnerable to invasion and speculative occupation.

Across the Brazilian Amazon, more than 500,000 km² of forest remain undesignated. These areas have become prime targets for land grabbers and illegal activities. The problem has been made worse in recent years by anti-environmental policies and rhetoric under the Bolsonaro government, which weakened environmental protections and oversight. This political climate fueled violence in the countryside and emboldened those seeking to profit from forest destruction.

In this context, the communities of Rio Manicoré are on the frontlines. Their demand for an RDS is not only about local survival; it is part of a broader effort to defend the Amazon from the wave of destruction sweeping through undesignated forests. Securing legal recognition is a key tool in this defense, but it must be accompanied by concrete measures: effective monitoring, enforcement against illegal activities, and support for community-led sustainable livelihoods.

Greenpeace’s “Amazon We Need” expedition is shining a light on these struggles and solutions. By visiting regions like Rio Manicoré, the expedition is helping to amplify the voices of local communities who are defending their territories and proposing sustainable models of forest use. The expedition also supports biodiversity research, documenting the richness of life in these forests and reinforcing the case for their protection.

The experience of Rio Manicoré shows that when communities have secure rights to their territories and support for sustainable practices, the forest stands a far better chance of survival. The CDRU they have won is a foundation on which an RDS can be built, but its success will depend on political will, enforcement, and continued solidarity with those who live in and care for the forest.

As undesignated forests across the Amazon remain under threat, the struggle of these communities is a reminder that protecting the forest and defending human rights go hand in hand. The path forward lies in recognizing and strengthening community-led initiatives, ensuring that legal tools like CDRUs and RDSs are fully implemented, and supporting efforts like the “Amazon We Need” expedition that work to safeguard the forest and promote sustainable models for the Amazon’s future.
