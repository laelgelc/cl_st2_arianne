Indigenous Peoples in Brazil’s North and Northeast regions are facing a surge in invasions by land grabbers, loggers, and drug traffickers. In response, communities have organized Guardians of the Forest groups to monitor and protect their territories from these incursions.

On November 1, 26-year-old Guardian of the Forest Paulo Paulino Guajajara was murdered by armed loggers in an ambush on his land. Another Guardian, Laércio Souza Silva Guajajara, survived after being shot. Paulino had been using technology to document invasions and deforestation, gathering evidence of the destruction and threats facing his people’s territory.

This killing reflects escalating threats under President Jair Bolsonaro’s agenda and is part of a broader system of resource extraction that profits multinational corporations. The violence is not new: from 2000 to 2018, 42 Guajajara were murdered. The pressure on Indigenous territories has intensified, with 160 invasions recorded in 153 Indigenous Lands in just the first nine months of 2019.

In the face of this situation, Indigenous leaders have traveled to Europe to urge governments, institutions, and the public to increase international pressure on Brazil. They are calling for Brazil to uphold Indigenous rights and protections, and to act against the invasions and violence targeting their communities and territories.
