Across Asia, people are transforming the way food is grown and caught, proving that everyday choices can help protect the environment while sustaining livelihoods.

In China, former city dweller Hou Xueying has embraced organic farming, turning away from chemical-intensive methods in favour of practices that work with nature. On her farm, ducks roam through the rice fields, fertilising the paddies and helping to maintain a healthy ecosystem. Instead of relying on conventional retail channels, she sells her produce online, connecting directly with consumers who care about how their food is grown. Looking ahead, she plans to welcome children to the farm to help them understand where their food really comes from and how it is produced.

Li Yang, who works closely with ecological producers, stresses that consumers play a powerful role in shaping the food system. By choosing ecological and sustainably produced food, people can drive demand for safer, healthier products and encourage more farmers to move away from harmful practices.

On the coast of Thailand, fisherman Jirasak Meerit has experienced first-hand what happens when marine resources are pushed to the brink. After years of destructive fishing methods, local fish stocks declined sharply, threatening both the ocean and the community’s way of life. In response, Jirasak changed his approach and helped lead a shift toward sustainable fishing in his community. Together, they agreed on regulations such as catching only mature sea animals, giving younger fish and other marine species the chance to reproduce and replenish populations. As these sustainable practices took hold, fish catches began to increase again, showing that protecting the ocean can also support stable incomes for fishers.

These stories are featured in the films “A Sustainable Catch” and “Farmed With Love,” which have been recognised as finalists in the Real Food Films competition. They highlight how farmers, fishers, and consumers can work together to build food systems that respect nature, safeguard health, and support communities.
