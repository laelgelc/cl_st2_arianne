Chemical pesticides have become a routine part of industrial agriculture, but their use comes at a serious cost to people and the environment. Greenpeace campaigns against these chemicals because they are not necessary for productive farming. Around the world, ecological pest management is already proving that farmers can successfully grow food without relying on synthetic pesticides.

A growing body of scientific literature paints a grim picture of the health impacts associated with pesticide use. On industrial farms, farmers and their families are on the frontline of exposure. But pesticides do not stay confined to fields: they move through air, water, soil, and food, ultimately reaching the wider public.

Research links pesticide exposure to a range of serious health problems. These include various cancers and neurodegenerative diseases, along with disruptions to the immune and hormonal systems. Evidence also connects pesticide exposure to birth defects and developmental problems, with pregnant women and children particularly at risk. Some people are more vulnerable because of genetic differences that affect how their bodies respond to or process these chemicals. There are also indications that harms can extend across generations, meaning today’s exposures may affect the health of children and grandchildren.

Proving direct cause-and-effect for specific chemicals is difficult, in part because people are often exposed to multiple pesticides and other pollutants over time. This complexity, however, does not erase the patterns of harm seen across many studies and communities.

There is a clear way forward: a shift from industrial, pesticide-dependent farming to ecological farming that works with nature rather than against it. Ecological approaches to pest management can protect crops while safeguarding human health and ecosystems, providing healthy food without the toxic burden.

This transition is not just a technical change in how we farm; it is a social and political one that needs public support. Everyone who eats has a role to play. By joining the growing food movement that demands ecological farming and a phase-out of harmful pesticides, people can help protect farmers, families, and future generations.
