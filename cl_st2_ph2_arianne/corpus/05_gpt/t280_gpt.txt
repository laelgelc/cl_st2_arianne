Irving and Dorothy Stowe’s journey to what would become Greenpeace began with a refusal to stay silent in the face of war and nuclear weapons. Pacifists deeply influenced by Gandhi’s non-violence and Quaker ideals, they left the United States because of their opposition to the Vietnam War and nuclear testing, seeking a place where they could live their values more fully. They found that home in Vancouver.

In Vancouver, the Stowes poured their energy into organizing campaigns against war and for ecological protection. Their activism took shape at a time when the world was grappling with the human and environmental costs of both military conflict and nuclear weapons. When the United States announced plans for underground nuclear tests on Amchitka Island in Alaska, the Stowes and their allies saw a stark example of these intertwined threats: a fragile ecosystem put at risk by a weapon of mass destruction.

In response, they helped form the Don’t Make A Wave Committee, a group dedicated to stopping the Amchitka tests. The committee brought together peace activists and environmentalists, united by the belief that defending the planet and defending peace were inseparable goals. The Stowes and others in the group organized around a simple but powerful idea: that ordinary people could confront a nuclear superpower through non-violent direct action.

The turning point came with a suggestion that captured the imagination of the group: sail directly into the nuclear test zone as a form of protest. This proposal offered a way to make the distant threat of nuclear testing visible and immediate, transforming concern into action. The Don’t Make A Wave Committee committed to the plan and began the practical work needed to turn it into reality.

To fund the voyage, they organized concerts, using music and culture to raise both money and awareness. These events helped them gather the resources needed to charter a small fishing boat, the Phyllis Cormack. In a symbolic act that reflected their vision, they renamed the vessel Greenpeace, fusing their commitment to peace with their commitment to protecting the Earth.

In 1971, the Greenpeace set sail for Amchitka Island. The aim was clear: to physically enter the test zone and shine a spotlight on the planned nuclear explosion. Although the crew did not succeed in stopping the test itself, the voyage had a powerful impact. The image of a small boat confronting a nuclear weapons program resonated around the world, inspiring growing public opposition to the tests.

The mounting global outcry contributed to the eventual cancellation of the Amchitka nuclear testing program. What began as a single protest voyage at sea became something larger: a catalyst for a new kind of environmental and peace movement. Out of this experience, and the momentum it created, the Greenpeace Foundation was founded.

From the Stowes’ decision to leave the United States, to the creation of the Don’t Make A Wave Committee, to the renaming of the Phyllis Cormack as Greenpeace and the 1971 voyage to Amchitka, each step was grounded in a belief that non-violent action could challenge some of the most destructive forces on the planet. The legacy of that journey lives on in the organization that took its name from that small boat and its bold mission.
