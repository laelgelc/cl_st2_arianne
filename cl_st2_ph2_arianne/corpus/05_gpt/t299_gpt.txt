When the X-Press-Pearl cargo ship caught fire and sank off the coast of Sri Lanka, the disaster did not stay at sea. It came ashore in waves of charred debris, hazardous cargo and billions of tiny plastic nurdles that coated the beaches and seeped into everyday life.

For coastal communities whose lives and identities are bound to the ocean, the impact was immediate and brutal. An 80 kilometre fishing ban was imposed around the wreck, cutting off the main source of income for thousands of fishermen and their families. Many were already on the brink after months of pandemic lockdowns that had shrunk markets and pushed household debts higher. Then came heavy rains and flooding, compounding the crisis and making recovery even harder.

Photographer and activist Tashiya stepped into this unfolding catastrophe with her camera, documenting what the official statements could not fully capture: beaches littered with nurdles and burned fragments of cargo, the sheen and smell of chemical contamination, and the haunting sight of dead marine life washed ashore. Her images trace the outline of a longer, slower disaster — long-term damage to coastal and marine ecosystems that will not be washed away with the next tide.

The nurdles themselves, billions of lentil-sized plastic pellets, are a symbol of a much deeper problem. They are the raw material of the global plastics industry, designed to be melted down and turned into countless products. Spilled into the ocean, they become a near-permanent pollutant, impossible to fully clean up and easy to mistake for food by fish, turtles and seabirds. The hazardous cargo and chemicals released from the X-Press-Pearl add another layer of toxicity, threatening human health, food security and biodiversity.

From what she witnessed on Sri Lanka’s beaches, Tashiya is clear about what needs to change. She calls for a halt to plastic production, arguing that the world cannot continue to churn out ever more plastic and expect frontline communities and ecosystems to absorb the cost. Instead, she urges a shift to a truly sustainable economy that prioritises the health of people and planet over short-term profit.

That means holding corporations to account for the full life cycle of their products and cargo — from production to transport to disposal — and not allowing them to walk away from the harm they cause. It means recognising that disasters like the X-Press-Pearl are not isolated accidents, but symptoms of a wider system driven by unchecked capitalist expansion and fossil-fuelled growth.

Tashiya’s work links the wreck on Sri Lanka’s coast to broader climate and ecological risks. As shipping intensifies, storms grow stronger and coastlines become more vulnerable, the likelihood and impact of similar incidents only increase. Without systemic change, communities like those along Sri Lanka’s shore will continue to pay the highest price for a model of development that treats oceans and people as expendable.

Her message, grounded in the lived reality of fishers, families and fragile ecosystems, is a warning and a call to action: stop plastic at the source, transform the economic system that fuels these crises, and confront the intertwined threats of capitalism and climate breakdown to prevent future disasters from repeating the story of the X-Press-Pearl.
