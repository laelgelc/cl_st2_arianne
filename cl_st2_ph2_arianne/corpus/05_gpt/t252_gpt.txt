In the Amazon, not all clouds in the air are the same. There is the natural, life-giving mist that rises from the forest, and then there is the dense, toxic smoke from fires linked to deforestation. One sustains life; the other threatens it.

The natural mist of the Amazon is part of the forest’s own breathing. It helps regulate climate, brings moisture, and supports the balance of this unique ecosystem. In stark contrast, smoke from deforestation-related fires fills the air with dangerous pollutants that directly harm people’s health.

The consequences are measurable and severe. A 2020 report documented 2,195 hospitalizations in 2019 for respiratory diseases caused by pollution from these fires, at a cost of BRL 5.64 million to the public health system. These hospitalizations spike during the fire season, when smoke blankets communities and turns everyday activities into health risks.

This polluted air does not affect everyone equally. Children and elderly people are hit hardest. Their lungs are more vulnerable, and exposure to smoke can quickly escalate into serious health problems. Conditions like asthma are aggravated, and those already living with respiratory or cardiovascular diseases face increased danger.

The impact of this smoke has also intersected with the COVID-19 pandemic. In Rondônia, for example, fire-related pollution has been linked to increased severity of COVID-19 cases. When lungs are already inflamed and weakened by smoke, respiratory infections can become more deadly.

Across much of the region, air quality frequently exceeds the limits recommended by the World Health Organization. This means that, for many Amazonian communities, simply breathing the air during the fire season can be hazardous.

The problem does not stop at human health. These fires release large amounts of greenhouse gases, contributing to the climate crisis, and they destroy habitats, driving the loss of biodiversity. The same flames that send children and grandparents to hospital are also burning away the forest’s capacity to regulate the climate and support life.

Protecting the Amazon is therefore not only about conserving trees and wildlife; it is a public health necessity. The contrast between the forest’s natural mist and the smoke from deforestation fires is a stark reminder of what is at stake. Urgent and effective government action is needed to prevent these fires, curb deforestation, and safeguard both the forest and the people who depend on it.
