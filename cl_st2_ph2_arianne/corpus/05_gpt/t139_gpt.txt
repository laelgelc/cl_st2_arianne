Plastic Free July is a powerful reminder that our everyday choices matter. Bringing a reusable cup to your local café, carrying your own bag to the shop, and refilling a water bottle instead of buying a new one each time are all important ways to cut down on single-use plastic. These actions help reduce waste, send a clear signal to businesses, and can inspire friends, family, and communities to rethink their own habits.

But personal action alone is not enough to solve the plastic pollution crisis. A small number of major corporations are responsible for a huge share of the world’s single-use plastic, and they continue to pump out disposable packaging at a staggering rate. Companies like PepsiCo, Nestlé, Unilever, and Coca-Cola have made only negligible progress on reuse and refill systems, even as plastic pollution chokes our oceans, harms wildlife, and threatens communities around the world.

Coca-Cola has announced a commitment to make 25% of its packaging reusable by 2030. This is a step in the right direction, but the company needs to move much faster and much further if it is to meaningfully reduce its plastic footprint. PepsiCo has said it will set a refill goal by the end of this year, yet concrete, ambitious targets and timelines are still missing. Meanwhile, the plastic keeps coming.

That’s why Plastic Free July must be about more than what we put in our shopping baskets; it has to be about what we demand from the corporations that dominate the global plastic market. Individual choices are important, but systemic change is essential.

You can help push for that change. By signing the Greenpeace petition, you add your voice to a growing global movement calling on PepsiCo, Nestlé, Unilever, Coca-Cola, and other major polluters to ditch single-use plastic and invest in real reuse and refill systems. And by downloading the Greenpeace toolkit, you can learn practical ways to pressure these companies—whether that’s engaging them on social media, talking to local retailers, or joining community actions that highlight the urgent need for corporate responsibility.

This Plastic Free July, keep using your reusable cup, bag, and bottle—but also take the next step. Stand with millions of others demanding that the biggest plastic polluters shift away from throwaway packaging and towards a future built on reuse. Your actions, combined with collective pressure, can help drive the systemic change our planet needs.
