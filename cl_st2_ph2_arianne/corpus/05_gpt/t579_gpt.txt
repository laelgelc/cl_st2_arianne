Standing on the deck of the research vessel Atlantis in 2000, Professor Gretchen Früh-Green did not set out to make a once-in-a-generation discovery. The mission was to map the seafloor. What she and her colleagues found instead was something that would reshape our understanding of the deep ocean: the Lost City hydrothermal vent field.

Far below the ship, at a depth of around 800 metres in the Atlantic, the team encountered a landscape unlike anything they had seen before. Rising from the seabed were towering white structures, shimmering in the darkness. Früh-Green describes them as “cathedral-like” formations, with geysers venting from their flanks and crests. Around them, colourful life thrived in a place that, at first glance, should have been hostile and barren.

Lost City is not just visually striking; it is scientifically unique. This hydrothermal vent field is sustained by processes that allow it to remain active for thousands of years. In a region of the ocean where sunlight never reaches, chemical reactions between rock and seawater create the conditions for life to flourish. For scientists like Früh-Green, this makes Lost City a natural laboratory, one that may hold vital clues about how our planet formed and how life first began on Earth.

The discovery was, as she recounts, a matter of chance. But the implications are anything but accidental. Lost City shows how much of the deep ocean remains unexplored and how many extraordinary ecosystems exist beyond our current knowledge. Each new site found underscores how little we understand—and how much we stand to lose.

Früh-Green speaks of Lost City with a sense of awe, but also with protectiveness. This is not just another data point in a scientific paper; it is a fragile, irreplaceable ecosystem that has taken millennia to develop. She warns that unregulated deep-sea mining could pose serious threats to places like this. The extraction of minerals from the seabed could stir up vast plumes of sediment, creating dust that smothers life in its path. The noise from heavy machinery could disrupt species adapted to the deep ocean’s relative quiet. And beyond these visible impacts, she highlights the unknowns: chemical changes and other consequences we do not yet fully understand.

In the face of these risks, Früh-Green calls for strong global protection. She urges the adoption of a Global Ocean Treaty to safeguard vulnerable deep-sea ecosystems like Lost City from destructive industries. Without clear, enforceable rules, the rush to exploit the deep sea could outpace our understanding of what is at stake.

The story of Lost City is a reminder that the ocean still holds wonders we have only just begun to uncover. It is also a warning that these wonders are not guaranteed to survive. Protecting them requires decisions made now, before industrial activity leaves a permanent mark on places that have endured for thousands of years in darkness, silence, and fragile balance.
