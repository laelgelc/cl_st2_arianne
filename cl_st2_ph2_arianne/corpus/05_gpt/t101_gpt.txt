World Cities Day on October 31 is a reminder that cities are now home to more than half of humanity, and that this share will keep growing, especially in Latin America, the Caribbean, Africa, and Asia by 2050. As urban populations rise, cities become decisive spaces for climate action, resilience, and justice. They are where the impacts of the climate crisis are deeply felt, but also where collective solutions can be built from the ground up.

The idea of #UrbanJustice places affected communities at the center of this transformation. It is about people coming together to reshape their streets, services, and institutions so they work for both social and climate justice. It is not only about reducing emissions or adapting to climate impacts, but doing so in ways that challenge inequality and exclusion.

In one city, Mangala’s cycling initiative confronts air pollution by reimagining how people move. By choosing bicycles over cars, and encouraging others to do the same, she is addressing a major source of urban emissions while opening up a cleaner, more accessible way to get around.

In Bogota, José’s street cleaning work is about creating more inclusive urban spaces. Clean, cared-for streets are safer and more welcoming, and they help ensure that public spaces belong to everyone, not only to those who already enjoy social and economic privilege.

In India, Kusum’s #PowerThePedal movement promotes sustainable mobility by supporting cycling as a practical, everyday mode of transport. This shift away from fossil fuel–dependent transport cuts pollution and congestion while making it easier for people, especially those with fewer resources, to move freely and safely in their cities.

In Istanbul, Dilruba’s work for gender equality is part of building cities that are fair and safe for all residents. When women and gender-diverse people can participate fully and safely in urban life, the policies and priorities that shape cities become more just, including those related to climate and the environment.

In Mexico City, the chinampas — traditional, water-based agricultural systems — help secure water access and prevent flooding. These living landscapes show how local knowledge and ecological practices can protect communities from climate impacts while sustaining food and water systems.

Together, these efforts show what #UrbanJustice looks like in practice: communities reclaiming power over their environments, building resilience, and insisting that climate solutions must also advance social justice. As cities continue to grow, these stories point to a future where urban spaces are not only more sustainable, but also more equitable and inclusive for everyone who calls them home.
