The disappearance of Brazilian Indigenista Bruno Araújo Pereira and journalist Dom Phillips in the Javari Valley is a chilling reminder of the dangers faced by those who dedicate their lives to defending the Amazon and exposing the truth. They vanished while documenting one of the most remote and threatened regions of the forest, an area that has become increasingly hostile to Indigenous Peoples, environmental defenders, and journalists.

Their disappearance cannot be seen in isolation. It is happening in a context where violence and impunity in the Amazon are growing. Under Bolsonaro’s government, illegal deforestation, fires, and mining have been emboldened. Criminal activities are encouraged by leniency toward environmental crimes, the sabotage of enforcement agencies, and the weakening of environmental protections. Those who profit from destruction are operating with increasing confidence, while those who stand in their way are exposed to ever greater risks.

At the same time, powerful agribusiness interests are pushing forward laws that reward land-grabbing and threaten Indigenous territories. These measures deepen the assault on the forest and the communities who have protected it for generations. By undermining Indigenous land rights and opening the way for further encroachment, they accelerate the destruction of the Amazon for agricultural expansion.

This is unfolding amid a global climate and biodiversity emergency. The Amazon is a critical ecosystem for regulating the climate and sustaining an extraordinary diversity of life. Its destruction for short-term profit pushes the planet closer to dangerous tipping points and erodes the foundations of life for countless species and communities.

In this context, the fate of Bruno and Dom is not only a matter of individual safety and justice, but also a reflection of what is at stake in the Amazon. Authorities must act swiftly and transparently to investigate their disappearance, identify those responsible, and confront the criminal networks that thrive on environmental destruction and violence.

Greenpeace stands in solidarity with Indigenous Peoples, who are on the frontlines of defending the forest and whose rights are essential to any hope of protecting the Amazon. Supporting their struggles and ensuring their territories are respected is fundamental to confronting the intertwined crises of climate breakdown and biodiversity loss.

The disappearance of Bruno and Dom is a call to refuse indifference. It is a call to insist that defending the Amazon and the rights of the peoples who live there is not a crime, but a duty. Greenpeace reaffirms its commitment to stand alongside Indigenous Peoples and all those who risk their lives to protect the forest, demanding justice, protection, and an end to the policies and practices that fuel violence and devastation in the Amazon.
