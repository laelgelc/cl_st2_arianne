The World Economic Forum’s annual meeting is happening very differently this January. Instead of private jets and closed-door conversations in the Swiss Alps, the gathering has moved online because of the COVID-19 pandemic, with an in-person session postponed to May in Singapore. That shift in venue and format reflects deeper geopolitical changes—but it also underlines a more fundamental question: who is shaping the recovery from this crisis, and in whose interests?

While COVID-19 has brought immense suffering and economic hardship for millions, some of the world’s richest individuals have seen their fortunes soar. Billionaires like Jeff Bezos have profited enormously during the pandemic. This widening gap between those who are thriving and those who are struggling has intensified public anger and sharpened demands for a recovery that is not only green, but also fair.

Across the world, people are calling for a transformation of the economic system that fuels both inequality and climate breakdown. Greenpeace is supporting radical policy proposals in many countries that aim to confront these intertwined crises head-on. In Canada, there are demands for a Wealth Tax so that those who have gained the most contribute their fair share to rebuilding societies and tackling the climate emergency. In the Philippines, Greenpeace is backing calls for a “New Normal” that would break with the old, destructive patterns of development and put people and the planet first.

In France, Greenpeace supports moves to ban dividend payouts for companies that refuse to take meaningful climate action, challenging the idea that shareholder profits can continue to come before a safe and stable climate. In India, the United States, Spain and New Zealand, Greenpeace is advocating for green recovery plans that accelerate the shift away from fossil fuels and towards cleaner, more resilient economies.

These demands are not coming from a small minority. Global polling shows strong public backing for deep, structural change rather than a return to business as usual. Around the world, people want governments and corporations to take bold steps that address both the climate crisis and entrenched inequality.

Greenpeace is standing alongside workers, communities and social movements in campaigns that push in this direction. The Make Amazon Pay campaign is one example, demanding that Amazon and its leadership treat workers fairly, pay their taxes, and take responsibility for their environmental impact. At the same time, Greenpeace is advocating for a #PeoplesVaccine to ensure that COVID-19 vaccines are treated as a global public good, accessible to everyone, everywhere, not just to those in rich countries or with deep pockets.

As the WEF promotes limited reforms and minor adjustments to the status quo, Greenpeace is urging people to join #BetterThanDavos actions and mobilizations. The message is clear: the world does not need small tweaks to an unjust system, it needs systemic change. This means rewriting the rules so that economic recovery plans confront inequality and climate change together, rather than sacrificing one for the other.

The virtual Davos meeting and the planned summit in Singapore may symbolize a shifting global order, but what matters most is who gets to define the future. By supporting wealth taxes, new economic models, restrictions on climate-destructive profiteering, ambitious green recoveries, and people-centred vaccine access, Greenpeace and its allies are insisting that the recovery from COVID-19 must be a turning point—a moment when societies choose justice and climate safety over the interests of the few.
