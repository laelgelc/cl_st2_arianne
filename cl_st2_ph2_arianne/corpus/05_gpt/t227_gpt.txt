When I joined a lawsuit against Indonesian officials in 2021, I did it first and foremost as a mother of two living in Jakarta. I was worried about the air my children were breathing, the coughs that never seemed to go away, and the haze that sometimes made it hard to see the city clearly. It felt like something was deeply wrong, and that those in power were not doing enough to protect us.

Being a plaintiff was not easy. It meant stepping into the public eye, challenging officials, and putting my hopes into a legal process that I wasn’t sure would deliver justice. But I knew that staying silent would not make the air any cleaner. Along with others, I wanted to send a clear message: clean air is essential for our health, our families, and our future.

In the end, the court ruled that the government had been negligent in protecting citizens from air pollution. The decision required the authorities to set air quality standards and to develop strategies to improve air quality with public involvement. For me, this ruling brought a sense of relief. It was an acknowledgment that our concerns were valid and that the government has a responsibility to act.

At the same time, the court did not declare clean air a human rights issue. That part of the decision left me uneasy. Without that recognition, I worry that the urgency might be lost, and that the changes we need could be delayed or weakened. I feel caught between hope and anxiety: hopeful because we won an important step, anxious because implementation is everything.

While we wait to see how the ruling will be carried out, the problems around us continue. Deforestation and forest fires still threaten our air, our climate, and our health. In cities, including Jakarta, trees are disappearing, replaced by concrete and buildings. Each tree cut down feels like one less shield between our lungs and dirty air.

Living with this reality has made me more determined to speak out. I believe public awareness is crucial. People need to understand how air pollution affects their health, their children’s development, and their economic well-being. When we know what is at stake, it becomes harder for decision-makers to ignore our voices.

Government transparency is just as important. We need clear, accessible information about air quality, pollution sources, and what is being done to address them. Without transparency, there can be no real accountability. And without accountability, promises remain only words.

I also believe that strict sanctions on polluters are necessary. If companies and individuals who damage our air face no serious consequences, there is little incentive for them to change. Protecting public health must come before profit and convenience.

At the same time, I know that change is not only about big policies and court decisions. It is also about everyday choices. Small actions, like using public transportation when possible, can help reduce pollution. These actions may seem minor, but when many people take them, they add up.

Most of all, I think about those who are most vulnerable: children, the elderly, people with existing health conditions, and low-income communities who often live closest to pollution sources. For them, dirty air is not an abstract issue—it is a daily threat to health and livelihood.

As a mother, a citizen, and a plaintiff, I will keep pushing for cleaner air. The court ruling was not the end of the story; it was a beginning. Now we must ensure that the commitments on paper become real changes in the air we breathe.
