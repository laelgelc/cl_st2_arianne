At COP27, governments finally took an important step by formalizing talks on “loss and damage” for climate‑vulnerable communities. For millions of people already living with the realities of climate breakdown, this is about more than technical negotiations: it is about justice, and about ending the economic models that allow big polluters to profit while others pay with their lives, lands, and futures.

“Loss and damage” is the name given to the harms that can no longer be avoided or adapted to – homes and farms washed away by floods, livelihoods destroyed by drought, and cultural heritage lost forever. For many African communities, these impacts are already here. Droughts are crippling agriculture and water supplies, while floods are destroying infrastructure and eroding fragile economies. These are not abstract risks in the distant future; they are lived realities that are undermining development and pushing people deeper into poverty.

At the heart of this injustice lies extractivism – an economic model rooted in colonial history, built on the large‑scale extraction of natural resources for export, with little benefit for local communities. This model has left a legacy of pollution and inequality, while channeling wealth to richer nations and corporations. Today, it continues in new forms, as fossil fuel projects and other extractive industries are promoted in the name of “development”, even when they primarily serve external markets and investors.

This is why calls for justice at COP27 cannot be separated from a clear demand to end the extractivist model. Climate‑vulnerable countries, especially in Africa, are being asked to bear the brunt of a crisis they did little to cause, while their resources are still being targeted to fuel the same system that created the problem. The push for new oil and gas investments on the continent risks deepening dependence on volatile fossil markets, locking in pollution, and repeating the patterns of exploitation that have defined centuries of unequal exchange.

African leaders are being urged to reject new fossil fuel investments not as a sacrifice for others, but for their own sake. Continued fossil fuel expansion threatens to undermine long‑term economic stability, expose countries to stranded assets, and worsen climate impacts that are already battering economies through droughts, floods, and other extreme events. Instead of doubling down on a failing model, leaders can demand the climate finance owed to them and direct it towards a just transition that prioritizes people and the planet.

A just transition means moving rapidly away from coal, oil, and gas, and investing in renewable energy systems that are accessible, affordable, and community‑centered. Fossil fuels are the primary driver of the climate crisis through the greenhouse gas emissions they produce. Without an urgent shift in the way energy is produced and consumed, the losses and damages already suffered in African countries will multiply, with more homes destroyed, more harvests lost, and more lives disrupted.

Yet the continent is also demonstrating what a different path can look like. Leaders such as Kenya’s President William Ruto and Morocco’s King Mohammed VI are often cited as examples of how countries can leapfrog directly to clean energy. By expanding renewable power and resisting the lure of new extractive fossil projects, they show that it is possible to tackle energy poverty without repeating the neocolonial patterns of exploitation. This approach does not simply replace one energy source with another; it challenges the idea that development must be built on extraction for export, rather than on meeting people’s needs.

Resisting neocolonial extractivism is essential to addressing both climate injustice and energy poverty. When African countries prioritize renewables and demand fair climate finance, they are asserting their right to choose a different future – one where communities are not sacrificed to pollution, where economies are not held hostage by fossil fuel volatility, and where the benefits of energy systems are shared more equitably.

The formalization of loss and damage talks at COP27 is a sign that the voices of climate‑vulnerable communities are finally being heard. But recognition alone is not enough. Justice requires that those most responsible for the climate crisis provide meaningful support to those most affected, and that the world moves decisively away from the extractive, fossil‑fuelled model that caused this crisis in the first place. African leadership in driving a just, renewable‑powered transition is central to that change – not only for the continent, but for a safer and fairer world for everyone.
