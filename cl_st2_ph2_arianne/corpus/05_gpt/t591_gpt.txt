From June 16th to 21st, people around the world will come together for the 5th Global Sharing Week, a major moment to spotlight how sharing can help build a new system that doesn’t depend on endless consumption and growth. That old model is driving climate crises we are already living through—from heatwaves to floods—by exhausting resources and pushing the planet beyond its limits.

Around 70% of global emissions come from urban consumption. What we buy, how often we replace things, and the way our cities are organised around constant purchasing all add up to a huge climate impact. Global Sharing Week is about turning that around through everyday actions that cut emissions, conserve resources, and strengthen our communities.

Sharing is not just an idea; it’s a practice. Fixing, making, mending, and joining community events are all ways to share skills, tools, spaces, and time. When we repair instead of replace, or borrow instead of buy, we reduce the demand for new production and the energy, materials, and pollution that come with it. These activities don’t just shrink our footprint—they also open space for innovation and collectivity, showing how people can meet their needs together rather than as isolated consumers.

Global Sharing Week already reaches over 100 million people every year, demonstrating the scale and potential of this movement. In 2018, MAKE SMTHNG events—celebrating creativity, repair, and making as alternatives to overconsumption—took place in 48 countries, further proof that people everywhere are ready to reimagine how we live, work, and consume.

To push this transformation further, it is vital to bring climate activists together with makers and sharers. Uniting these communities can drive bottom-up change: practical, local solutions that add up to systemic shifts. Climate justice, creative repair, and community sharing are deeply connected, and when they come together they can challenge the logic of endless growth in powerful ways.

Everyone can play a part. Joining a local Global Sharing Week event—whether it’s a repair café, a skill-share workshop, a swap, or a neighbourhood gathering—is a way to help build this new system in your own community. By showing up, sharing what you have, and learning from others, you help prove that a different way of living is not only possible, but already underway.
