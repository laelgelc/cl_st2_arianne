In 2015, people power stopped one of the world’s biggest oil companies in its tracks. Seven million of us came together to halt Shell’s Arctic expansion, and months later governments agreed in Paris to move away from fossil fuels and towards a safer, more sustainable future. Those moments showed that when we act together, we can protect what we love and change the course of history.

Today, the Arctic needs that same global solidarity again.

The Arctic is warming at twice the rate of the rest of the planet. This isn’t an abstract statistic; it is transforming one of the most fragile regions on Earth in real time. January sea ice has reached record lows, exposing areas of ocean that were once locked under ice year-round. As the ice retreats, it is opening the door not only to more fossil fuel interests, but also to destructive industrial fishing.

In the Barents Sea, melting ice has allowed trawlers to move into previously ice-covered areas. These are waters that provide vital habitats for Arctic wildlife and underpin entire ecosystems. Bottom trawling in such sensitive zones can devastate seabed life, stir up sediments, and damage structures that have taken centuries to form. The impact is not theoretical: in Norway, 30–50% of coral reefs are already damaged. These cold-water reefs are biodiversity hotspots, and their destruction puts whole food webs at risk.

Greenpeace investigations at the North Atlantic Seafood Forum have shown how this destruction can quietly reach our plates and supermarkets. The supply chains behind the fish fingers, fillets, and frozen products in our freezers are connected to the Arctic.

Companies such as Havfisk ASA, Ocean Trawlers, and FIUN have been identified supplying major processors like Espersen, High Liner Foods, and Findus. Those processors in turn sell to well-known retailers around the world. When trawlers operate in vulnerable Arctic areas, the fish they catch can move through these supply chains, potentially tainting everyday products with the hidden cost of Arctic destruction.

This is not just about a distant ocean; it is about the integrity of our food systems and the responsibility of companies profiting from them. Retailers and processors have a choice: they can demand that their suppliers stay out of vulnerable Arctic waters, or they can allow their brands to be linked to the loss of irreplaceable ecosystems.

People have already shown what is possible. The same collective power that pushed Shell out of the Arctic and helped secure the Paris climate agreement can now push governments and corporations to protect the Arctic from destructive fishing and further exploitation.

A global declaration to #savethearctic is a way to turn individual concern into a shared demand that cannot be ignored. By signing, people around the world can call for the protection of fragile Arctic ecosystems, an end to destructive trawling in vulnerable areas like the Barents Sea, and truly sustainable practices from the companies that profit from Arctic resources.

The Arctic is warming fast, its sea ice is shrinking, and its coral reefs and seabed habitats are under pressure from industrial fishing. But it is not too late to act. Add your name to the declaration to #savethearctic and help ensure that this unique region is protected, not plundered.
