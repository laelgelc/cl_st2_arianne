In 1995, coastal communities in Prachuab Khiri Khan (PKK), Thailand, were confronted with plans for coal-fired power plants that threatened to transform their home. For generations, people in PKK had relied on the sea and the land—fishing, farming, and, increasingly, tourism—to sustain their livelihoods. The proposed coal projects brought with them fears of pollution, damage to marine and coastal ecosystems, and disruption to the way of life that anchored the province.

As details of the plans emerged, local people discovered serious problems in the process. There were concerns about the Environmental Impact Assessments: residents questioned their transparency and whether they genuinely reflected the risks to their health, environment, and economy. Allegations of illegal land acquisition deepened mistrust. Instead of being consulted about a project that would reshape their future, many felt decisions were being pushed onto them without their consent.

In response, communities across PKK began to organize. Fisherfolk, farmers, small business owners, and families came together to oppose the coal plants using non-violent tactics. They held protests and demonstrations, making their voices visible and impossible to ignore. Billboards and signs appeared along roadsides and in villages, declaring their opposition to coal and their determination to protect their land and sea. What started as local resistance grew into a broader movement, rooted in shared concern for the environment and the right to participate in decisions affecting their lives.

Greenpeace Thailand joined in solidarity with the communities. The organization helped shine a national and international spotlight on PKK’s struggle, supporting local demands for transparency, accountability, and environmental protection. In 2000, the Greenpeace ship Rainbow Warrior visited the area, symbolizing global support for the fight against the coal projects and amplifying the voices of those on the frontlines.

The movement was not without grave risks. In 2004, community leader Charoen Wataksorn, a prominent figure in the resistance, was assassinated. His killing shocked the province and beyond. Instead of silencing the movement, this act of violence galvanized it. People in PKK responded with even greater determination, intensifying their protests and reaffirming their commitment to non-violent resistance. Charoen’s leadership and sacrifice became a powerful source of inspiration for the struggle to keep PKK coal-free.

As protests grew stronger and more sustained, pressure mounted on decision-makers. The persistent, organized, and peaceful resistance from local communities, supported by groups like Greenpeace Thailand, eventually led the government to cancel the coal-fired power plant projects. The land and sea that had been under threat were spared from coal development.

Today, Prachuab Khiri Khan remains free of coal-fired power plants. The province continues to rely on the very foundations the communities fought to protect: vibrant fisheries, fertile farmland, and a thriving tourism sector. The successful resistance in PKK has become a touchstone for environmental and community movements in Thailand and beyond, demonstrating how sustained, non-violent action can defend local livelihoods and ecosystems.

The story of PKK continues to inspire ongoing activism. It shows how communities, when united and supported, can challenge powerful interests and shape their own future. The legacy of this struggle lives on in every fishing boat that still sets out to sea, every farm that continues to harvest, and every person who stands up to protect their home from destructive development.
