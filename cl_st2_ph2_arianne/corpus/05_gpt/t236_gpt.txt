COP26 was billed as a turning point for the climate, but its embrace of carbon offsetting schemes is putting people and the planet in danger. Instead of driving the deep, immediate emissions cuts needed to keep global heating below 1.5°C, the summit helped supercharge a market of offsets whose benefits are often unverifiable and whose harms are all too real.

Carbon offsetting is sold as a simple solution: keep polluting in one place, and “compensate” somewhere else through projects that supposedly remove or avoid emissions. In practice, this often means land-hungry schemes that spark land grabbing, threaten Indigenous Peoples, and damage biodiversity. Forests and other ecosystems become accounting tools for corporations, rather than living homes for communities and wildlife.

One prominent example is the aviation industry. Airlines are offering customers the option to “neutralize” the climate impact of their flights by paying into forest protection projects. But these schemes cannot guarantee permanent carbon storage, and they do nothing to reduce the continued burning of fossil jet fuel. Meanwhile, the land targeted for such projects is frequently inhabited, used, or stewarded by Indigenous Peoples and local communities, raising the risk of displacement and human rights violations.

Fossil fuel companies are also leaning heavily on offsets to justify business-as-usual expansion. TotalEnergies is pursuing drilling in Congo’s carbon-rich peatlands, a move that threatens to release massive amounts of stored carbon and damage a vital ecosystem. The company claims it will “compensate” this destruction through tree plantations elsewhere. Yet these plantations often rely on non-native species, undermining local biodiversity and failing to replicate the complex carbon storage of intact peatlands. The fundamental problem remains: new fossil fuel extraction continues, and the damage is waved away with paper promises.

The meat industry is using similar tactics. JBS, one of the world’s largest meat companies, has announced a “net-zero” plan that leans on offsets while ignoring its massive methane emissions. Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas, and industrial meat production is a major source. At the same time, JBS is deeply linked to the destruction of the Amazon rainforest. Any “net-zero” pathway that sidesteps methane and ongoing deforestation is not a climate solution—it is greenwashing.

A Greenpeace video series exposes how these offsetting schemes allow corporations and governments to appear climate-responsible while delaying real action. By focusing on “net zero” targets propped up by offsets, they avoid the hard but necessary work of transforming energy, food, and land-use systems.

The alternative is “real zero”: actually cutting emissions at the source instead of trying to balance them on paper. Real zero means:

- Rapidly phasing out fossil fuels rather than expanding drilling and exploration.
- Phasing out industrial meat production that drives deforestation and methane emissions.
- Protecting the rights of Indigenous Peoples and local communities, whose lands and knowledge are crucial for safeguarding biodiversity and stable climates.
- Shifting energy systems to renewable sources.
- Moving towards plant-rich diets that reduce pressure on forests and ecosystems.
- Doing all of this without relying on carbon offsets as a substitute for real change.

Offsets are being used as a license to pollute, a way to dress up destructive practices in green rhetoric. To protect Indigenous Peoples, biodiversity, and any remaining chance of staying below 1.5°C, climate action must be rooted in genuine emissions cuts, justice, and systemic transformation—not in accounting tricks that trade land, lives, and ecosystems for corporate convenience.
