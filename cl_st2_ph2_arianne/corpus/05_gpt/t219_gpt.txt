Around the world, people spent 2021 confronting climate breakdown, pollution, and environmental injustice. It was another year of wildfires, floods, and record temperatures. But it was also a year when communities, campaigners, and courts won powerful victories that can shape a fairer, greener future.

In Gambia, local communities and activists stood up to the destructive fishmeal industry. A controversial fishmeal plant that threatened marine ecosystems and local livelihoods was halted, showing how organized resistance can protect both the ocean and the people who depend on it.

In the Pacific, New Zealand took a stand for the seabed. The country rejected plans for destructive seabed mining, a move that helped safeguard fragile marine ecosystems and set an important precedent against sacrificing the ocean floor for short-term profit.

On the global energy front, a major shift came when China pledged to stop building new coal projects overseas. For years, Chinese finance and companies have been central to coal expansion around the world. This commitment marked a significant step in the global transition away from the dirtiest fossil fuel and sent a strong signal to financial institutions and governments everywhere.

In the Arctic, a long-awaited moment of accountability arrived. Russia imposed a historic fine on Norilsk Nickel after a massive oil spill in the Arctic. The decision showed that even powerful polluters can be held responsible for environmental disasters, and it underlined the growing legal and political pressure on companies that treat fragile ecosystems as sacrifice zones.

In Mexico, food sovereignty and environmental health took a step forward. The government moved to ban genetically modified corn and phase out the use of glyphosate. This shift supported farmers, biodiversity, and public health, and challenged the grip of agribusiness giants on food and farming systems.

Off the coast of the UK, fossil fuel expansion faced a major setback. Shell withdrew from the controversial Cambo oil field project in the North Sea after mounting public opposition and scrutiny. The decision signaled that new large-scale oil developments are increasingly risky, both politically and economically, in a world that must rapidly move beyond fossil fuels.

Shell also faced a landmark legal defeat in the Netherlands. A Dutch court ordered the company to cut its carbon emissions by 45% by 2030, relative to 2019 levels. This ruling was historic: it made clear that corporations have a legal responsibility to align with climate goals, and that voluntary pledges are not enough in the face of the climate crisis.

In North America, one of the most controversial fossil fuel projects of the last decade was finally stopped. The Keystone XL pipeline, long opposed by Indigenous communities, land defenders, and climate activists, was officially cancelled. Its end showed how persistent, grassroots resistance can overcome powerful industry interests and shift the conversation on what kinds of infrastructure belong in a climate-safe future.

In Indonesia, residents of Jakarta took their struggle for clean air to court—and won. A court ruling ordered authorities to address the city’s severe air pollution, affirming that people have a right to breathe clean air and that governments can be compelled to act when they fail to protect public health and the environment.

And in France, the justice system delivered another powerful message. A court found the French state negligent for failing to take sufficient action on climate change. This case added to a growing body of legal decisions worldwide that recognize government obligations to protect people and the planet from climate breakdown.

Taken together, these ten wins from 2021 show that change is not only possible—it is already happening. Communities are defending their rights and their environments. Courts are holding governments and corporations to account. Countries are starting to turn away from fossil fuels and destructive practices.

The challenges ahead remain immense, but these victories are proof that organizing, persistence, and courage can deliver real, tangible progress. They are milestones on a longer journey toward climate justice, and they offer a powerful source of hope and momentum for the work still to come.
