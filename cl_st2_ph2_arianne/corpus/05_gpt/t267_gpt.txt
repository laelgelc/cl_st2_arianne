Across Europe, people are taking to the streets, bike lanes, and even parking spaces to demand a fairer, cleaner way of moving through their cities. During Greenpeace’s Mobility Week, the #MobilityForAll campaign is uniting local actions under a shared call: urban mobility must be equitable, sustainable, and accessible to everyone.

In Italy, activists and residents are reclaiming space usually dominated by cars. For Park(ing) Day, ordinary parking lots are being temporarily transformed into people-friendly areas, showing what cities could look like if streets were designed for communities instead of traffic. These creative interventions highlight how much valuable urban space is currently given over to parked cars, and how that space could instead support greener, more livable neighborhoods.

In Romania, the Critical Mass Bike Ride is putting pressure on decision-makers to support cycling as a real alternative to car use. Cyclists in Bucharest are demanding 100 kilometers of bike lanes in the capital, pushing for safe, continuous infrastructure that allows people of all ages to choose the bicycle as an everyday mode of transport. Their message is clear: without serious investment in cycling infrastructure, promises of sustainable mobility will remain empty words.

Belgium is seeing mobilization around public transport, as people protest against cuts that threaten to make buses, trams, and trains less frequent, less reliable, and less accessible. These cuts risk pushing more people back into cars, deepening inequality and increasing pollution. Protesters are insisting that public transport must be strengthened, not weakened, if cities are to reduce emissions and ensure that everyone can move around affordably and efficiently.

In Hungary, activists are using reverse graffiti on Car-Free Day to expose the hidden toll of air pollution. By cleaning messages into dirty surfaces, they are drawing attention to the deaths caused by polluted air, linking everyday traffic to a public health crisis. The action underlines how urgently cities need to reduce car dependence and protect people’s health.

Spain is mobilizing against airport expansions that would lock in higher emissions for decades to come. Campaigners are challenging plans that contradict climate goals and are instead calling for a shift toward more sustainable transport options. Alongside these protests, a pre-week model train display in Spain showcased rail as a climate-friendly alternative, emphasizing the role of trains in connecting people and regions without fueling the climate crisis.

Pre-week actions also took place in Germany, where protests at the IAA (the International Motor Show) targeted climate-damaging cars. Demonstrators confronted an industry still heavily focused on high-emission vehicles, sending a clear signal that the era of polluting transport must end.

All of these actions are part of a shared vision. Greenpeace’s Mobility Week is promoting sustainable transport as a key way to cut CO2 emissions and make cities more just and livable. The demands echo across borders: more car-free zones where people can walk, play, and breathe; improved and affordable public transport; full accessibility so that everyone, regardless of income or ability, can get around; shared mobility options that reduce the need for private car ownership; safe and extensive cycling infrastructure; and more green spaces woven into the urban fabric.

The #MobilityForAll campaign shows that a different kind of city is not only possible but already being imagined and tested in streets, squares, and parking spots across Europe. By pushing for sustainable, equitable mobility, these actions are charting a path toward cities that put people and the climate first.
