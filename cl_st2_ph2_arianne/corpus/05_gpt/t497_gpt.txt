Australia’s recent bushfire crisis has been accompanied by a wave of misinformation that distracts from the real causes and the urgent need for climate action. False claims that the unprecedented fires were primarily the result of arson or “green policies” have spread rapidly, often amplified by coordinated online disinformation campaigns and automated bot accounts. These narratives are not only misleading, they also undermine efforts to address the climate emergency that is driving more extreme fire conditions.

The fires occurred after Australia experienced its hottest, driest year on record. These conditions created vast areas of tinder-dry vegetation, turning landscapes into fuel waiting for a spark. In this context, it is crucial to separate the ignition of fires from the conditions that allow them to become catastrophic. While individual fires can start in many ways, from dry lightning strikes to accidents, the scale and ferocity of the bushfire season were made possible by a climate already pushed to dangerous extremes.

Claims that arson was the main cause of the crisis have been repeatedly used to deflect attention from climate change. However, data shows that only a very small fraction of the fires were deliberately lit—around 1%. The overwhelming majority were started by natural causes like dry lightning or by accidental human activity. Focusing on arson as the primary explanation for the disaster is therefore inaccurate and misleading.

At the same time, there has been a concerted attempt to blame environmentalists and “greenies” for supposedly blocking essential fire management measures, such as hazard reduction burns or firebreaks. These accusations do not stand up to scrutiny. The narrative that environmental protections or conservation groups prevented sensible fire controls has been pushed heavily online, often without evidence and in coordination with other climate denial talking points. This misdirection shifts responsibility away from those failing to act on climate change and onto people who are, in many cases, advocating for stronger climate policies to reduce fire risk in the long term.

The role of disinformation in this crisis is significant. Coordinated networks of social media accounts, including bots, helped spread false or exaggerated claims about arson and anti-environmentalist conspiracy theories. These campaigns aim to confuse the public, polarise debate and delay meaningful climate action. By flooding the information space with misleading stories, they make it harder for people to understand what is really happening and why.

While these arguments play out, many Australians—especially in major cities—have been forced to breathe toxic smoke haze for weeks on end. People far from the fire fronts have still suffered serious health impacts as air quality plummeted to hazardous levels. The smoke blanketing cities is a visible, tangible reminder that bushfires intensified by climate change affect everyone, not just rural or forest communities.

Some political leaders and commentators have argued that it is “not the time” to talk about climate change during a disaster. But postponing this conversation only benefits those who want to avoid responsibility. The fires are not an isolated tragedy; they are part of a pattern consistent with a warming climate. Refusing to discuss climate change while communities are suffering from its impacts is a way of protecting the status quo, not the public.

Australia’s political response has been widely criticised, particularly the failure to take strong action on emissions and the continued commitment to large-scale coal exports. As one of the world’s biggest coal exporters, Australia plays a significant role in fuelling the global climate crisis that is making extreme fire seasons more likely. Ignoring this connection while communities face unprecedented bushfires is a profound abdication of responsibility.

To move forward, it is essential to reject misinformation that blames arson or environmentalists for a crisis fundamentally driven by record-breaking heat and drought in a warming world. A clear-eyed understanding of the role of climate change is not a matter of political opinion but a necessary foundation for protecting people, nature and the places we love from ever-worsening fire seasons.
