The Karipuna Indigenous people in Rondônia, Brazil, are fighting for their survival and for the future of the Amazon forest they protect. Their territory, ratified in 1998, spans 152,930 hectares of rainforest. Today, only 58 Karipuna remain, and they are under constant threat.

Illegal loggers and land grabbers are invading their protected land, pushing deeper into the forest and surrounding the Karipuna with deforestation and cattle farms. The pressure is not just environmental but also deeply personal and dangerous. Members of the community face death threats as they try to defend their home in a country that is considered the deadliest in the world for environmental defenders.

The situation has become even more precarious after a key protection structure was attacked. A FUNAI (Brazil’s Indigenous affairs agency) office, which should help safeguard Indigenous rights and territories, was recently burned. With this office destroyed, the Karipuna are left even more vulnerable to invasions and violence.

The scale of destruction is already visible. In the first months of 2017 alone, more than 1,000 hectares of their territory were deforested. Each new clearing not only destroys the forest but also undermines the Karipuna’s ability to live according to their culture and traditions, and to protect the biodiversity that depends on this land.

In response, the Karipuna are working with allies to resist. Together with Greenpeace Brazil and CIMI (the Indigenous Missionary Council), they are using satellite monitoring to detect and document illegal invasions and deforestation. This technology helps expose what is happening on the ground and supports their calls for protection and enforcement.

Karipuna leader Adriano is taking their struggle to the global stage. He will speak at the United Nations in New York to share the reality his people are facing, to demand action to protect their community, and to defend the forest that sustains them and contributes to the stability of the global climate. His message aims to ensure that the Karipuna are not forgotten and that their territory—and the Amazon forest within it—receives the protection it urgently needs.
