Young activists Andreas Magnusson and Ell Ottosson Jarl from Fridays for Future recently sat down with Greenpeace co-founder Rex Weyler to reflect on how they found their way into climate activism, and what keeps them going when the scale of the crisis feels overwhelming.

For Andreas and Ell, the path into activism began with direct experiences of nature, and with learning more about what is happening to the living world. Research on extinctions made clear just how much is at stake. Anti-war sentiments also played a role, connecting the drive for peace with the struggle for climate justice and a livable future.

They described how, like many young people, they sometimes feel overwhelmed by the climate crisis. What sustains them is a mix of powerful emotions and strong relationships. Global friendships within the movement give them a sense of shared purpose that crosses borders. Anger at injustice fuels their determination rather than leading to despair. Community support and the simple act of staying active—showing up, organizing, taking part in actions—help them keep going even when the news is hard to face.

Amid the challenges, they also see reasons for hope. They pointed to growing media attention on the climate crisis as a sign that the message is breaking through. Even the rise in greenwashing, they suggested, shows that powerful actors now feel pressured to at least appear to respond to public concern about the climate—evidence that activism is having an impact, even if the responses are often inadequate or misleading.

Rex Weyler brought in his long experience from Greenpeace’s early days to offer practical advice on how movements can stay resilient and connected across borders. He emphasized the importance of building international connections while managing egos, so that personal conflicts don’t derail collective efforts. He spoke about meditation as a way to cultivate inner stability and focus, helping activists cope with stress and burnout. He also encouraged studying leaders like Mahatma Gandhi to learn from past movements about nonviolence, discipline, and the power of unity.

Together, their reflections painted a picture of a global climate movement rooted in lived experience of nature, informed by research and history, strengthened by friendship and community, and sustained by both moral outrage and practical tools for resilience.
