Taiwan’s coral reefs are in crisis. Across the island’s surrounding seas, corals are turning white and dying as record-high ocean temperatures—exceeding 30°C—combine with other human-driven pressures to push these fragile ecosystems to the brink.

Coral bleaching happens when corals, stressed by heat, expel the symbiotic algae living in their tissues. These algae provide corals with both their vibrant colors and much of their energy. Without them, corals bleach, weaken, and can die if stressful conditions persist. Around Taiwan, continuous ocean warming driven by climate change is making extreme temperatures more frequent and more intense, leaving corals less and less time to recover.

Fewer typhoons are also playing a role. While storms can cause physical damage to reefs, they also help cool surface waters by mixing deeper, colder water upward. With fewer typhoons passing through, Taiwan’s coastal waters are staying hotter for longer, compounding the stress on corals already struggling with relentless warming.

On top of rising temperatures, local pollution is worsening the situation. Agricultural pesticides and wastewater carried into the ocean add chemical stress and degrade water quality, making it harder for corals to survive and recover from bleaching events. Harmful chemicals in some sunscreens are another problem, contributing to coral damage in heavily visited coastal and reef areas.

The impacts reach far beyond the corals themselves. As reefs bleach and die, the complex habitats they create begin to break down. Fish and countless other marine species that depend on coral structures for food, shelter, and breeding grounds lose their homes, disrupting the entire marine ecosystem around Taiwan.

Coral reefs also form a vital natural barrier that helps protect coastlines from waves and erosion. As reefs degrade, shorelines become more vulnerable to storm surges and long-term erosion, putting coastal communities at greater risk. Tourism and fisheries, both closely tied to healthy reef ecosystems, are also threatened as coral cover declines and marine biodiversity diminishes.

Recovery, where it is still possible, is painfully slow. Corals generally grow at only about 1 cm per year, which means that large-scale damage can take decades to repair—if harmful conditions ease. With repeated bleaching events and ongoing pollution, many reefs may never return to their former state.

Preventing further loss requires tackling the root causes. Ambitious carbon reduction is essential: replacing fossil fuels with sustainable energy sources is crucial to slow global warming, reduce ocean heating, and limit acidification that further stresses corals. At the same time, continued and strengthened preservation efforts are needed to reduce local pressures—such as pollution and harmful chemicals—so that reefs have a fighting chance to survive and adapt in a rapidly changing ocean.
