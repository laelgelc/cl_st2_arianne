Two years after the Rana Plaza factory collapse in Dhaka, where over 1,000 people were killed and more than 2,500 injured, the human cost of cheap fashion is impossible to ignore. The rubble may have been cleared, but the way the fashion industry operates is still putting workers and communities at risk, from unsafe buildings to toxic pollution.

The global fashion system is built on a model that treats both people and the environment as disposable. Behind the low prices and fast-changing trends lie hazardous chemicals, contaminated rivers and air, and supply chains where those who make our clothes are often invisible. The Rana Plaza tragedy exposed this reality to the world, but the deeper, slower disaster of toxic production continues every day.

There are signs of change. More than 30 companies, including 18 major fashion brands that together represent 10% of the sector, have committed to Detox: a process of eliminating hazardous chemicals from their supply chains. This commitment is already having an impact. In places like China, factories supplying these brands are becoming cleaner as toxic substances are phased out and safer practices are introduced. These steps show that when big brands act, real improvements are possible.

But voluntary commitments and partial progress are not enough. The people who died or were injured at Rana Plaza must be fully compensated, and the industry as a whole must accept responsibility for ensuring that such a disaster never happens again. That means safe workplaces, fair treatment, and supply chains that do not poison the communities where clothes are made.

Everyone who wears clothes has a role to play in demanding this transformation. A growing Fashion Revolution is using social media to push for transparency and accountability. By taking simple actions—like posting selfies that show our clothing labels and asking brands #whomademyclothes—we can send a clear message: we want an industry that protects workers and the environment, not one that sacrifices both for profit.

Two years on from Rana Plaza, the choice facing the fashion world is stark. It can continue the toxic, opaque practices that led to tragedy, or it can embrace a future where clean production and ethical supply chains are the norm. The Detox commitments prove that change is possible. Now that the cost of inaction is so clear, there is no excuse for delay.
