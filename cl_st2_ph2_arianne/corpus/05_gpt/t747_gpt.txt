Plastic is everywhere. It wraps our food, lines our shelves, and fills our bins. But what we don’t see as easily is where it ends up: in our rivers and oceans, in the bellies of marine animals, and even in the water and food we consume. Every single minute, a truckload of plastic enters the oceans. Once there, it doesn’t disappear – it breaks down into tiny fragments called microplastics that harm marine life and contaminate the very systems we depend on.

This crisis is global, but so is the response. Around Earth Day, people on every continent came together to push back against plastic pollution in powerful and creative ways.

On beaches in South Africa and across six European countries, artists and activists used sand itself to tell the story of our plastic-choked seas. Striking sand sculptures rose from the shoreline, transforming coastlines into open-air galleries that made the invisible impacts of plastic impossible to ignore.

Others took the fight straight to the rivers that carry so much of our waste to the ocean. In Kenya, volunteers rolled up their sleeves along the Nairobi River, removing plastic from the waterway and its banks. In the United States, people gathered along the Anacostia River to do the same. But they didn’t stop at collecting trash; they also recorded which brands were most commonly found, gathering evidence to hold major polluters accountable.

This wave of action extended far beyond a single day. More than a million people added their names to petitions demanding change, showing governments and corporations that the public is no longer willing to accept a throwaway culture.

On the ground, volunteers around the world put that demand into practice. In Malaysia, people cleaned up the iconic Batu Caves area, exposing how even treasured cultural and natural sites are not spared from plastic waste. In Spain and the UK, community members engaged directly with supermarkets, challenging them to cut unnecessary plastic from their shelves and rethink how everyday products are packaged.

In Senegal, educators and volunteers focused on awareness, helping communities understand how plastic pollution affects their health, livelihoods, and environment. In Mexico, artists and activists turned plastic into powerful visual statements, using art to spark conversations and inspire action.

All of these efforts share a common message: we don’t have to wait for someone else to fix the plastic crisis. Each cleanup, each petition signature, each conversation with a local shop or supermarket adds up. When millions of people act, it sends an unmistakable signal to the companies producing plastic and the decision-makers who regulate them.

If you want to be part of this growing movement, there are tools to help you get started. The Million Acts of Blue toolkit is designed to support community action against plastic pollution. By downloading it, you can find practical ideas and resources to organize cleanups, engage local businesses, educate your community, or create art that speaks to the urgency of the crisis.

Plastic pollution is a problem created by human choices, and it can be tackled by human action. From rivers in Kenya and the U.S. to beaches in Europe and South Africa, from markets in Spain and the UK to cultural sites in Malaysia and communities in Senegal and Mexico, people are already showing what’s possible. The next act of change can be yours.
