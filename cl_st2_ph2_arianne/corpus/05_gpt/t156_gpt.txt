For more than half a century, Greenpeace has turned to art and creativity to help people see the environmental crises unfolding around them—and to imagine a different future. Across continents and cultures, artists, activists, and local communities have come together to transform streets, fields, ice, and even carnival parades into powerful calls for action on plastic pollution, deforestation, and the climate emergency.

In Malaysia and cities around the world, murals have risen on walls and buildings to defend rainforests from the destruction driven by palm oil expansion. These public artworks do more than decorate urban spaces: they tell the stories of threatened forests and the communities and wildlife that depend on them, bringing distant frontlines of deforestation into everyday city life.

In Africa, creativity has taken the form of striking visual campaigns like the African Trash Masks ads, confronting the growing crisis of waste. By turning discarded materials into haunting, mask-like images, these works force a reckoning with how much we throw away—and where it ends up.

In Taiwan, an aerial dance performance has used movement and gravity itself to show the reality of plastic-choked seas. Dancers suspended in the air depicted marine animals suffocating on plastic, creating a visceral experience of what is happening beneath the ocean’s surface, out of sight but not out of consequence.

Sound has also become a medium for action. From the Papuan rainforest, the rich tapestry of natural noises—birds, insects, wind, and water—was woven into a dance track. This transformed the living soundscape of one of the world’s most important rainforests into a piece of music that can travel far beyond its borders, reminding listeners that these ecosystems are vibrant, complex, and worth protecting.

In Italy, creativity took center stage at the Viareggio Carnival, where a giant whale sculpture, choked with plastic, joined the parade. The familiar joy and spectacle of carnival collided with the disturbing reality of ocean plastic pollution, confronting thousands of people with a vivid image of what our throwaway culture is doing to marine life.

Around the world, melting penguin ice sculptures have appeared in public spaces as a fragile symbol of oceans in crisis. As the sculptures slowly disappeared, they mirrored the threats facing polar and marine ecosystems in a warming world, turning the passage of time itself into a stark warning.

In Brazil, a symbolic march has been used to speak out against destructive mining. Through performance and presence, people have embodied resistance to the exploitation of land and communities, carrying a message that resonates far beyond the streets where they walk.

Fields have also become canvases. In Thailand, rice field art has promoted sustainable farming practices, using living crops to form images visible from above. This fusion of agriculture and art highlights how food production and environmental protection can go hand in hand.

Far to the north, on Arctic ice, a reimagined version of Leonardo da Vinci’s Vitruvian Man has been created in a melting form, urging climate action. Placed in one of the regions most visibly transformed by global heating, this iconic human figure—distorted and disappearing—underscores how deeply the climate crisis cuts into the foundations of human life.

Across all these examples, art is not an accessory to environmental activism—it is one of its most powerful tools. By turning complex issues into images, sounds, performances, and shared experiences, Greenpeace and its allies help people feel the urgency of protecting our planet, and invite them to become part of the story of change.
