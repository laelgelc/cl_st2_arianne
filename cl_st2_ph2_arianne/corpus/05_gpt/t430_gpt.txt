COVID-19 has taken a devastating toll in Brazil, with more than 57,000 lives lost. Among those most at risk are Indigenous Peoples in the Amazon, whose territories and health are under escalating pressure from illegal mining.

As of June 29, Brazil’s Articulation of Indigenous Peoples (APIB) reported 9,294 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 383 deaths among Indigenous communities. These figures are not just numbers; they represent communities whose survival is deeply tied to their territories, cultures and ways of life. The spread of the virus into Indigenous lands is being intensified by illegal miners who continue to invade protected areas, potentially carrying COVID-19 into remote villages that have limited access to healthcare and are particularly vulnerable to new diseases.

In May, Greenpeace carried out a flyover that documented intense mining activity in the Indigenous lands of the Munduruku people and the Sai Cinza community. Between January and April 2020, these areas alone accounted for 60% of all deforestation alerts linked to mining in the entire Brazilian Amazon. What is being lost is not only forest cover, but also the safety buffer that Indigenous communities depend on to keep invaders—and now, a deadly virus—at bay.

The situation is equally alarming in the Yanomami territory, where more than 20,000 miners are estimated to be operating illegally. Their presence increases the risk of COVID-19 transmission and deepens the threat to the Yanomami people, whose rights and survival depend on the integrity of their land. The combination of disease risk, environmental destruction and the violation of Indigenous rights raises the specter of a humanitarian catastrophe that APIB and others have warned could amount to genocide if not urgently addressed.

The crisis is not confined to Indigenous territories. Deforestation driven by mining in conservation units has also surged, rising 80.62% compared to the previous year. These protected areas are critical for biodiversity, climate stability and the health of surrounding communities. Their destruction undermines the resilience of the entire Amazon region at a moment when the impacts of COVID-19 demand stronger, not weaker, environmental safeguards.

In response to what it documented, Greenpeace filed a formal complaint detailing the illegal mining and associated deforestation. This complaint contributed to the opening of a lawsuit that demands the removal of miners from these territories by the competent authorities. Protecting Indigenous lands and conservation units from illegal mining is not only a legal obligation; it is an urgent public health measure and a moral imperative in the face of a pandemic that is already killing thousands across Brazil.

Ensuring that miners are removed, territories are respected and deforestation is halted is essential to prevent further loss of life. The Amazon’s Indigenous Peoples are on the frontline of overlapping crises—COVID-19, environmental destruction and rights violations—and their survival depends on decisive, immediate action to safeguard their lands.
