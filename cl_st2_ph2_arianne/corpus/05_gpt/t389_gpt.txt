Kristian Sloth, former journalist and Agricultural Campaigner at Greenpeace Denmark, has given voice to a group of people who are too often ignored: the neighbors of industrial pig factories in Denmark. In his new documentary film, he follows Danes living side by side with a form of agriculture that has transformed their daily lives and their homes.

The neighbors describe a stench so intense it shapes their social lives and their sense of dignity. They talk about feeling ashamed when friends or family visit, fearing that guests will be overwhelmed by the smell drifting from nearby pig factories. Everyday routines have become impossible: they cannot hang laundry outside because it absorbs the odor, and a simple breath of fresh air is no longer guaranteed.

The pollution is visible as well as smellable. Ammonia emissions from the factories leave green algae on the walls of nearby homes, a constant reminder of the industrial activity next door. The air around them contains more than 200 chemicals, including ammonia and methane, substances linked to serious respiratory illnesses. For many of these residents, this is not an abstract health risk but a lived reality. They report headaches, stomach aches, diarrhea, and difficulty breathing.

Scientific studies back up what they describe. Research confirms elevated risks of asthma, skin problems, and other health issues for people living close to industrial livestock production. What the neighbors feel in their bodies is reflected in the data: the air around these facilities is hazardous.

The impact is also economic and emotional. Many of the affected residents bought their homes long before industrial pig production moved in. What were once safe, stable places to live have become properties they can no longer sell. They are effectively trapped, surrounded by a system they did not choose.

Denmark now has more than 3,000 industrial pig factories and the highest number of pigs per capita in the world. This concentration of intensive pig production makes the country a stark example of a much wider, global development. The stories in Kristian Sloth’s documentary are rooted in Danish fields and villages, but they speak to a broader reality wherever industrial livestock production is expanding: communities living in the shadow of factories, paying the price with their health, their homes, and their quality of life.
