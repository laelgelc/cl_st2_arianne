Around the world, communities, courts, and campaigners are winning powerful victories for people and the planet. Recent developments show that when people organize, speak out, and refuse to accept environmental destruction as “normal,” real change follows.

In Sweden, years of determined action helped secure a major win for ocean protection. Back in 2009, boulders were placed on the seabed in Swedish marine protected areas to physically block destructive bottom trawling. This controversial but effective tactic drew attention to how industrial fishing was tearing up supposedly protected ecosystems. In 2022, that pressure paid off: Sweden banned bottom trawling in its marine protected areas, a crucial step toward healthier seas and more resilient marine life.

On another front, resistance to the East African Crude Oil Pipeline (EACOP) has grown into a global movement. The pipeline threatens communities, water sources, and wildlife along its route. In response to mounting concerns and the growing #StopEACOP campaign, the European Parliament passed a resolution opposing the project’s risks to human rights and the environment. This resolution has strengthened the call for financial institutions and governments to distance themselves from the project and support safer, fairer energy pathways instead.

In British Columbia, Indigenous leadership is helping caribou herds recover from steep declines. Indigenous groups there are using maternity pens—secure enclosures that protect pregnant caribou and their newborn calves during their most vulnerable period—to boost survival rates. This approach is helping to stabilize and increase local caribou populations, and highlights how Indigenous stewardship and knowledge are central to restoring threatened species and ecosystems.

Globally, the recognition of environmental rights has taken an important step forward. The United Nations has formally declared that all people have a right to a healthy environment. This decision strengthens the moral and political case for governments to protect air, water, climate, and biodiversity, and it offers communities a powerful tool in their struggles against pollution and ecological destruction.

In Southeast Asia, people-powered climate action has reshaped a country’s energy future. In Thailand, a proposed coal-fired power plant in Krabi faced strong opposition from local communities and environmental groups, as well as critical environmental assessments. The project was ultimately canceled, opening space for cleaner, more sustainable energy options and protecting coastal ecosystems and livelihoods that depend on them.

In South Africa, the courts have affirmed that fossil fuel companies cannot trample on communities and nature with impunity. A court revoked Shell’s rights to conduct offshore oil and gas exploration after finding that the approvals were granted illegally and without proper consideration of impacts on marine life and coastal communities. The judgment underscored that environmental laws and public participation requirements must be respected, and it set an important precedent for challenging harmful fossil fuel projects.

Taken together, these stories show a clear pattern: when communities organize, when Indigenous rights and knowledge are respected, when legal systems are used to hold power to account, and when international bodies recognize environmental rights, destructive projects can be stopped and healthier futures can be built. These wins are not the end of the struggle, but they are proof that change is possible—and already happening.
