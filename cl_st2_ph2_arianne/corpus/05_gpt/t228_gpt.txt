I first picked up a Greenpeace camera in 1974, not fully understanding how much my life was about to change. For the next eight years, my view of the world was framed through a lens on the deck of small, stubborn ships that dared to put themselves between industrial violence and the living ocean.

Those early campaigns began with a simple, audacious idea: charter ships, sail into the open sea, and confront whaling fleets where they worked. We had no illusion of power in the conventional sense—no navy, no government, no weapons. What we had were boats, cameras, and a determination to bear witness.

On the water, the scale of the whaling fleets was overwhelming. Steel hulls, massive harpoons, flensing decks slick with blood. We were tiny in comparison, but our tactic was clear: place our inflatable boats between the whales and the harpoons, and record everything. The camera became as important as the ship’s wheel. Every frame was a way to show the world what was happening far beyond any coastline.

The 1975–1976 confrontations with Russian whalers remain some of the clearest memories I have. We would race across the swells in small boats, the whaling ships towering above us, their harpoon guns tracking the whales—and sometimes us. You could feel the tension in your bones: the thud of the engines, the crackle of radio chatter in languages we barely understood, the sickening moment when a harpoon fired.

We couldn’t always stop the killing, but we could make it visible. I remember the spray of seawater, the cries of the crew, the sudden silence after a shot, and the realization that somewhere, later, people sitting in their living rooms would see this and be forced to decide how they felt about it. That belief—that images could move hearts and change policy—kept us going through cold, fear, and exhaustion.

Not all of our work was far offshore. Off the coast of Labrador, we turned our cameras toward the harp seal hunts. The ice was a stark landscape: white, endless, broken only by the shapes of seals and the figures of hunters. The public outcry over the commercial seal hunt was intense, but on the ice we also had to face a more complicated reality: local and Indigenous communities whose relationship with seals was rooted in subsistence and culture, not industrial profit.

Our presence there meant constantly negotiating what it meant to oppose a brutal commercial industry while respecting the rights and livelihoods of people who had lived with the ice and seals for generations. We worked to halt the commercial harp seal hunts off Labrador while seeking compromises with local and Indigenous hunters, trying to ensure that our cameras didn’t erase their stories or needs. It was a delicate balance, and the images I brought back carried that tension within them.

The fight for a livable planet didn’t stop at the shoreline. My camera followed Greenpeace into anti-nuclear campaigns that felt, at times, like standing in the shadow of another kind of harpoon—one aimed at the future. At Rocky Flats, a nuclear weapons facility, and at Seabrook, the site of a proposed nuclear power plant, we joined with a broad coalition of activists, artists, and community members. Among them was Allen Ginsberg, whose presence brought poetry and a different kind of visibility to the blockades.

Photographing those actions meant capturing not only confrontation but also community: people linking arms, singing, meditating, and refusing to move. The cameras recorded the lines of police, the makeshift banners, the faces of people willing to be arrested rather than accept a nuclearized world. It was another form of bearing witness—this time to the power of collective resistance.

By 1981, our focus turned more explicitly to the fossil fuel industry. That year, we staged what we called a “test blockade” of an oil tanker. Compared to the massive infrastructure of oil, our action was small, but it was a sign of what was coming: a recognition that the same logic driving whaling fleets and nuclear plants was also embedded in the tankers that moved oil across the seas.

From the deck, looking up at the looming hull of the tanker, I felt a familiar mix of fear and resolve. We were once again in fragile boats, dwarfed by industrial machinery, trying to show the world what it looks like when ordinary people physically challenge the engines of environmental destruction. My photographs from that day carry the same energy as those from the whaling campaigns: tiny human figures, immense metal walls, and the thin, bright line of moral refusal.

Between actions, we sometimes visited abandoned whaling stations—ghosts of an industry that had once seemed unstoppable. Walking through those derelict sites, camera in hand, I saw rusting winches, empty flensing platforms, and buildings slowly collapsing back into the landscape. It was like stepping into a future we hoped to create for all whaling operations: silent, dismantled, consigned to history.

Those places were eerie, but they were also strangely hopeful. They proved that even the most entrenched industries could end. The photographs I took there were quieter than the ones from the high seas, but they told an important part of the story: that change was possible, and that the world could choose to leave some forms of exploitation behind.

The footage from our whale confrontations traveled far beyond anything we could have imagined when we first set out. What we filmed on those cold, heaving decks ended up on television screens around the world. People who had never seen a whale outside of a book suddenly watched them being hunted in real time. They saw our small boats sliding between the whales and the harpoons, and they saw the violence that had long been hidden by distance and indifference.

As a photographer, I watched how those images took on a life of their own. They sparked conversations, protests, and political debates. They helped shift public opinion and contributed to a growing movement that eventually pushed governments and international bodies to act. The global media impact of that footage confirmed what we had believed from the start: that if people could truly see what was happening, many of them would demand change.

By the time my work as a Greenpeace photographer came to an end in 1982, I carried with me not just rolls of film and stacks of prints, but a deep sense of what it means to stand witness. From confronting whaling fleets and halting harp seal hunts off Labrador, to joining anti-nuclear blockades and testing the waters of direct action against oil, those years showed me how images can connect distant struggles and help build a shared understanding of what is at stake.

Looking back on those campaigns now, I remember the cold spray, the roar of engines, the chants at blockades, the quiet of abandoned stations, and the knowledge that a camera, in the right place at the right time, can help turn a moment of courage into a turning point for the world.
