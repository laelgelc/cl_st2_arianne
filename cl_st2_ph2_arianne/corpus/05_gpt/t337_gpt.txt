Greenpeace Switzerland activists sent a clear message to Nestlé ahead of the company’s Annual General Meeting in Vevey. By projecting powerful messages onto Nestlé’s headquarters, they drew attention to the corporation’s role in fueling both the plastic and climate crises through its dependence on single-use packaging.

The activists called on Nestlé to move away from throwaway plastics and to invest in reusable systems instead. They criticized the company’s focus on recycling and so‑called alternative materials, calling these approaches greenwashing that fails to address the root of the problem and continues to harm biodiversity.

The scale of Nestlé’s plastic footprint is immense. In 2020 alone, the company sold 1.3 million tonnes of single-use plastic, with less than 1% of its packaging being reusable. Nestlé has also been repeatedly named among the top global plastic polluters, underscoring the urgency of transforming its packaging model.

The projections at the Vevey headquarters highlighted how plastics are made from petroleum, linking Nestlé’s packaging directly to fossil fuel extraction and global warming. By exposing this connection, Greenpeace Switzerland urged Nestlé to shift decisively from single-use to reuse as a critical step to tackle plastic pollution and the climate crisis together.
