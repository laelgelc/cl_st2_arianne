Over 100 climate activists from 17 countries remain detained in Geneva, 20 hours after a peaceful protest targeting Europe’s largest private jet fair, EBACE. The activists, representing groups including Greenpeace and Extinction Rebellion, took action inside the event to confront what they see as one of the clearest symbols of climate and social injustice: private jets.

During the protest, activists occupied exhibited jets, chained themselves to the gangways, and unfurled banners carrying stark messages: private jets “Burn Our Future,” “Kill Our Planet,” and “Fuel Inequality.” At the same time, they broadcast announcements highlighting the environmental and social damage caused by private jet use.

Private jets are at the heart of a widening inequality in the climate crisis. They emit far more CO2 per passenger than trains, yet their sales are booming. This boom is happening in the middle of escalating climate impacts that are hitting those who fly the least—and often cannot afford to fly at all—the hardest. For the activists, private jets are not just a luxury; they are a powerful symbol of how a wealthy minority fuels a crisis that endangers everyone.

The protesters’ demands are clear. They are calling for a complete ban on private jets and for the immediate release of all activists still being held in Geneva following the action. Supporters are being urged to stand with them by signing a petition backing these demands and amplifying the call for climate justice and an end to the era of private jets.
