Greenpeace mourns the loss of two courageous environmental defenders in Mexico: Homero Gómez and Raúl Hernández. Killed within days of each other, they dedicated their lives to protecting the monarch butterfly habitats in Michoacán from illegal logging.

Gómez managed a sanctuary for monarch butterflies, working to safeguard one of the world’s most iconic migratory species and the forests they depend on. Hernández was a tour guide who helped connect visitors with the beauty and importance of this fragile ecosystem. Both stood up against illegal logging in a region where corruption and environmental destruction persist.

Their murders are part of a wider and deeply troubling global pattern: violence used to silence those who defend land, forests, water, and climate. Across Latin America, environmental and land defenders are being targeted and killed at an alarming rate. Such attacks are not isolated incidents but occur with shocking regularity, including in countries like Nicaragua.

These killings take place against the backdrop of the escalating climate crisis and ongoing destruction of ecosystems. While the impacts of climate change are felt worldwide, the risks are not shared equally. Frontline activists—often working in remote or contested areas—face intimidation, threats, and deadly violence for defending their territories and communities.

Greenpeace demands justice for Homero Gómez and Raúl Hernández and for all environmental defenders whose lives have been taken. Their deaths must not be met with impunity. Governments must ensure effective protection for those who stand up for the environment and human rights, and they must hold those responsible for violence and corruption to account.

Greenpeace also calls for global solidarity with land and environmental defenders. Protecting the people who protect the planet is essential in the struggle against climate change, deforestation, and environmental degradation. The bravery of Gómez, Hernández, and countless others on the frontlines reminds us that defending nature is not only an environmental necessity, but also a matter of justice and human rights.
