The smell of ash still hangs in the air at Pribaikalsky wildlife reserve. Charred trunks stretch across the hillsides like a forest of blackened spears, and underfoot, the soil crumbles into grey dust. Three years after a massive wildfire tore through this UNESCO-protected area on the shore of Lake Baikal, the land is still struggling to come back to life.

In 2015, flames swept across the reserve and destroyed around 60% of its vegetation. What had been a thriving habitat became a landscape of loss almost overnight. Today, instead of signs of steady recovery, the scars remain starkly visible. New growth is sparse. In many places, there is almost no shade, no underbrush, and very little sign of the rich diversity that once defined this place.

To make things worse, the damaged forest is now being logged. In an area that should be protected for its global ecological value, heavy machinery and cutting operations are moving into a landscape already pushed to the brink. The same slopes that burned are now echoing with the sound of chainsaws. For a reserve that forms part of one of the world’s most iconic freshwater ecosystems, this is a double blow.

Walking through this wounded forest is volunteer firefighter Solbon Sandgiev, a member of the Buryat Indigenous group. For him, the destruction is not only environmental, but deeply personal. The forests around Baikal are part of his people’s identity and spiritual world, a living homeland that holds stories, traditions, and a sense of belonging.

Solbon talks about the cultural importance of preserving nature here: how the land is tied to language, history, and community. When the forest burns, it is not just trees that are lost, but the places that shape who people are. He fears that if the fires continue and the logging expands, the Buryat people could lose their homeland in a very real and irreversible way.

Across Russia, more than 90% of wildfires are man-made. That statistic weighs heavily on those who live close to the land. These are not inevitable natural disasters; they are the result of human actions and failures—carelessness, weak enforcement, and policies that do not truly protect forests and communities.

In the face of this, official responses are falling short. Authorities are failing to adequately prevent or fight the fires. That vacuum is being filled by ordinary people who refuse to stand by and watch their forests disappear. Volunteers like Solbon organise themselves, travel to fire lines, and fight with what limited tools and protection they can gather.

They are up against intense heat, smoke, and dangerous conditions, often without the proper equipment that professional firefighting units would consider basic. Yet they keep going, driven by a sense of responsibility to their land, their culture, and future generations.

Their message is simple and urgent: respect the forests. Treat them not as a resource to be exploited and abandoned, but as a living system that sustains people, cultures, and the climate. Every careless fire, every preventable blaze, pushes places like Pribaikalsky closer to a point where recovery may no longer be possible.

These volunteers cannot and should not have to shoulder this burden alone. They need support: protective gear, tools, and resources to keep themselves safe while they protect the forest. Donations can help provide the equipment they lack and strengthen the community firefighting efforts that are, right now, a last line of defence for Lake Baikal’s forests.

Standing in the scorched reserve, it is clear how much has already been lost. But it is equally clear how much people like Solbon are determined to save. Their courage is a call to action—to stand with them, to support them, and to ensure that the forests of Pribaikalsky, and the culture rooted in them, still have a future.
