Fifty years after Greenpeace first set sail, and as the world approaches the anniversary of the Limits to Growth study, it is impossible to ignore how clearly the 1970s saw what was coming. That decade marked a turning point: ecological awareness broke into mainstream consciousness as pollution, species loss, and resource depletion began to look less like isolated incidents and more like symptoms of a systemic crisis.

Since then, environmental movements have grown, laws have been passed, and international conferences have multiplied. From new regulations on pollution to global agreements on conservation and climate, governments and institutions have acknowledged the problem in increasingly explicit terms. Public concern has surged; sustainability is now a familiar word in politics, business, and everyday life.

Yet, despite all this, human society has not become sustainable.

Over these same decades, the living fabric of the planet has been torn at an accelerating pace. Wildlife biomass has plummeted. Insect populations, which underpin entire ecosystems and food webs, have declined in many regions. Marine species have been depleted, from the great fish once considered inexhaustible to the smaller creatures that sustain ocean life. Forests, vital for climate stability and biodiversity, have continued to shrink and degrade.

At the same time, human pressure on the Earth has soared. The global population has roughly doubled. Greenhouse gas emissions have also doubled, driving a rapidly worsening climate crisis. Even as we’ve talked more about sustainability, our collective footprint has grown larger and heavier.

The summary of these 50 years is stark: symptoms of ecological breakdown have intensified, not eased. Climate change, mass extinction, soil degradation, collapsing fisheries, and forest loss are all interconnected expressions of a deeper imbalance.

That underlying imbalance is overshoot.

Overshoot means that human activity is exceeding the Earth’s regenerative capacity. Each year, we take more from ecosystems than they can replenish and dump more waste, including carbon dioxide, than they can safely absorb. This is not just another issue alongside climate change or biodiversity loss; it is the meta-problem that drives them all.

Focusing only on visible symptoms—like rising temperatures or disappearing species—without addressing overshoot is like treating a fever without confronting the infection. Superficial solutions that tinker at the edges of the current system, without reducing the overall pressure we place on the planet, cannot restore balance.

What these anniversaries highlight is the need for a deeper ecological understanding. It is not enough to adopt the language of sustainability while continuing to grow our demands on a finite Earth. Real change means recognizing that human societies are embedded within, and entirely dependent on, the living systems we are currently undermining.

The past fifty years have provided ample warning. The challenge now is to move beyond half-measures and cosmetic fixes, and to confront overshoot directly—by bringing human activity back within the boundaries of what the Earth can regenerate, and by grounding our decisions in the ecological realities that were already visible half a century ago.
