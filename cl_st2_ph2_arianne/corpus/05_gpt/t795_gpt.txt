In 2017, Greenpeace conducted a radiation survey in some of Fukushima’s most contaminated areas, including Iitate and Namie. The findings revealed that, even after extensive cleanup efforts, radiation levels remained persistently high in many locations. The government’s decontamination program, which was meant to make these areas safe for people to return, has not achieved that goal.

One of the central problems is recontamination. Even where soil has been scraped away and other surface decontamination measures carried out, radioactive contamination continues to migrate back into residential areas from the surrounding forests and hillsides. These forested areas have not been, and in many cases cannot be, effectively decontaminated. As a result, radiation can be carried by wind, rain, and the natural movement of soil and organic material, undermining the limited effectiveness of cleanup work in towns and villages.

The decontamination program has also generated an enormous volume of nuclear waste. Projections indicate that about 30 million cubic metres of contaminated soil and other radioactive waste will be produced. This waste is currently stored at more than 141,000 sites across Fukushima and beyond, ranging from large storage areas to numerous smaller locations. The scale of this waste problem is unprecedented in Japan, and it poses long-term environmental and safety challenges.

To manage this growing volume, vast quantities of contaminated material are being transported to interim storage facilities in the towns of Okuma and Futaba. These massive transport operations involve moving radioactive soil and debris through communities and along public roads, raising concerns about ongoing exposure risks and the long-term sustainability of such a system. The interim sites themselves are not a final solution, and the question of what will ultimately happen to this waste remains unresolved.

Despite these unresolved dangers, the Japanese government has been pressuring evacuees to return to their former homes in areas like Iitate and Namie. Official policies to lift evacuation orders and cut housing and other support are pushing people back into areas where radiation levels remain elevated and recontamination is ongoing. This approach shifts the burden of risk onto the affected communities, rather than ensuring their long-term protection and well-being.

The situation is compounded by reports of worker exploitation within the decontamination and cleanup industry. Workers, often performing dangerous and difficult tasks in contaminated environments, face inadequate protections and precarious employment conditions. The enormous financial cost of the decontamination program and waste management is also a major concern, especially when weighed against its limited effectiveness and the ongoing risks it fails to resolve.

Greenpeace’s 2017 survey underscores that Fukushima’s nuclear disaster is far from over for the people living with its consequences. It highlights the need to place human rights and public health at the centre of all decisions. In this context, it is essential that the Japanese government fully accept and implement the recommendations made by the United Nations Human Rights Council. These recommendations call for stronger support and protection for affected citizens, with particular attention to the needs and rights of women and children, who are often the most vulnerable to both radiation risks and the social and economic impacts of displacement.

Rather than prioritizing a narrative of “normalization” and return at any cost, policies must recognize the ongoing contamination, the unresolved nuclear waste crisis, and the lived reality of those who continue to bear the burden of the Fukushima disaster. Accepting and acting on the UNHRC recommendations is a critical step toward justice and genuine recovery for all affected communities.
