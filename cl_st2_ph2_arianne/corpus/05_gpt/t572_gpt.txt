Every year, our obsession with the newest gadget fuels a silent crisis. Phones, laptops, and tablets are marketed as symbols of progress and status, yet behind the sleek designs lies a wasteful, destructive system that treats both people and the planet as expendable.

At the heart of this problem is a culture of extravagant consumption. Devices are pushed on us in rapid cycles, with each new release framed as indispensable. But these products are not just frequently replaced; they’re often built to be replaced. Planned obsolescence is baked into the design of many electronics, ensuring that devices have short lifespans and are difficult—or deliberately impossible—to repair.

Some of the most iconic products, such as iPhones, embody this trend. Companies like Apple design devices that are hard to open, hard to fix, and increasingly dependent on proprietary parts and software locks. At the same time, they lobby against right-to-repair laws that would empower people and independent repairers to keep products in use for longer. This is not an accident. It is a business model that prioritizes constant sales over durability, repairability, and resource conservation.

The consequences are staggering. The world now generates more than 65 million tonnes of electronic waste every year. Much of this e-waste contains valuable materials, but it is often dumped, burned, or poorly processed, causing pollution and health hazards. Before these devices become waste, their production has already scarred ecosystems through destructive mining for the minerals and metals they contain. Forests are cleared, water sources are contaminated, and communities are displaced so that the raw materials for our short-lived electronics can be extracted.

A Greenpeace report has examined how major electronics companies perform on these issues. It highlights that not all firms are locked into the worst practices. HP, Dell, and Fairphone are recognized for making products that are more repairable and for taking steps that align better with a sustainable future. On the other hand, companies like Samsung and others are criticized for failing to prioritize repairability and for lagging behind in reducing their contribution to the e-waste crisis.

This contrast shows that different choices are possible. Companies can design electronics that last longer, can be easily repaired, and can be upgraded instead of discarded. But voluntary change from industry will not be enough. Policies are needed that require durability, standardize parts where possible, and guarantee access to repair information and tools. Right-to-repair legislation is a key part of this shift, as are regulations that push manufacturers toward circular production models—where products, components, and materials are kept in use for as long as possible.

A truly circular approach to electronics would mean designing for longevity from the start: batteries that can be replaced, screens that can be swapped out, and components that can be upgraded without throwing away the entire device. It would also mean building robust systems for reuse, refurbishment, and recycling so that the resources already extracted are used again and again, rather than continuously tearing new materials from the earth.

Yet even the best design and policy changes will fall short if we do not confront the underlying culture of overconsumption. As long as social status and personal identity are tied to owning the latest device, the pressure to upgrade will remain intense. Modest consumption—choosing to keep devices longer, repair instead of replace, and buy only what we truly need—is essential to reducing the strain on ecosystems and cutting the flow of e-waste.

This shift is not about deprivation; it is about redefining what progress looks like. Moving away from disposable electronics helps reduce ecological overshoot—the point at which humanity’s demand on nature exceeds what the planet can regenerate. By using fewer resources and wasting less, we free up space for the rapid expansion of renewable energy and other climate solutions that are crucial for a livable future.

The story of our electronics does not have to be one of extraction, waste, and pollution. It can be one of durability, repair, and respect for planetary limits. But that will only happen if we challenge the current model—where companies profit from planned obsolescence and hard-to-repair design—and demand a system that values people and the planet more than endless upgrades.
