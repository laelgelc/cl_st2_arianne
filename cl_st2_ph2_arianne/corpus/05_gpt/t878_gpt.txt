Companies around the world are beginning to respond to growing public concern over plastic microbeads in personal care products, but the pace of change still needs to accelerate.

Following Greenpeace East Asia’s July ranking of 30 international companies on their progress in phasing out microbeads, several major brands have announced or clarified their commitments.

Amway Taiwan has stated that, starting from 1 October 2016, it will replace microbeads with biodegradable ingredients in its only product that contains them. LG Household & Health Care has committed to stopping the use of microbeads by the end of 2016. A Japanese company has pledged to complete its phase-out by June 2018, having already begun switching to plant-derived materials in 2014.

Procter & Gamble has set a target of 2017 to remove microbeads from its products. Shiseido has announced plans to replace microbeads in all its products globally by 2018. Estee Lauder has also expanded the scope of its existing commitment to phase out microbeads.

These steps show that public pressure and transparency can drive corporate action, but plastic pollution remains an urgent problem. Microbeads, once washed down the drain, can enter rivers, lakes and oceans, contributing to the broader crisis of plastic in the environment.

To truly protect waterways and marine life, companies need to move faster and ensure that all products are free from plastic microbeads as soon as possible. Voluntary commitments alone are not enough. Governments should introduce and strengthen bans on the manufacture and sale of products containing plastic microbeads, closing loopholes and ensuring that regulations apply to all rinse-off personal care products.

Consumers also have a powerful role. Checking product ingredient lists and avoiding items that contain plastic microbeads, supporting campaigns that call for bans and stronger corporate policies, and sharing information with friends and family can all help to speed up the transition away from these unnecessary plastics.

Every commitment to phase out microbeads is progress, but the goal must be a swift end to their use worldwide, backed by strong laws and informed consumer choices.
