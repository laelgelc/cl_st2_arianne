Biodiversity is the living fabric of our planet, and that fabric is tearing. Without urgent action to protect the natural world, we risk undermining the very systems that make Earth habitable for people and wildlife alike. As governments gather at the CBD summit in Cancun, they face a clear choice: continue down a path of broken promises and escalating destruction, or finally admit past failures and commit to bold protections for the ecosystems we all depend on.

The warning signs could not be clearer. Scientists forecast that by 2020, the world could see a two-thirds decline in animal species compared with 1970 levels. This isn’t just a statistic—it signals the rapid unravelling of ecosystems that provide clean air, fresh water, food, and a stable climate. Each lost species is part of a broader collapse that threatens human well-being as much as wildlife.

Governments have known this for years, and they have already made promises they are failing to keep. In 2010, they pledged to protect 10% of the world’s oceans and to manage the world’s forests sustainably by 2020. Yet those commitments remain largely unfulfilled. Only about 3% of the oceans are currently protected, leaving marine life and coastal communities exposed to overfishing, pollution, and climate impacts. On land, forests that should be safeguarded as global commons are still being carved up and degraded.

Among the most critical of these forests is the vast Great Northern Forest. This immense ecosystem is home to Indigenous and local communities, countless plant and animal species, and the largest terrestrial carbon store on Earth. Its health is inseparable from the health of the climate and the stability of our global environment. Yet it is under mounting pressure from industrial logging, intensifying forest fires, and the accelerating impacts of climate change. Every tree felled and every hectare lost erodes not only biodiversity, but also one of our strongest natural defenses against climate disruption.

The Arctic Ocean is another frontline. As ice retreats and industrial interests move in, this fragile region faces growing threats from extraction, shipping, and other activities that could irreversibly damage its ecosystems. Protecting the Arctic Ocean and the Great Northern Forest is not optional; it is essential if we are to maintain a planet that remains safe and livable.

At Cancun, governments must do more than issue new statements. They need to openly acknowledge that they have fallen short of their 2010 promises and commit to real, enforceable protections for oceans, forests, and the communities who depend on them. That means expanding protected areas, ending destructive industrial practices, and ensuring resources are shared fairly and sustainably.

Public pressure is crucial to making this happen. People everywhere can demand that their leaders defend the natural world, not the short-term interests of those profiting from its destruction. By speaking out, organizing, and holding governments to account, we can help secure a future where biodiversity is not sacrificed, but safeguarded—for the climate, for communities, and for all life on Earth.
