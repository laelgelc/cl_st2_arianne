In the heart of Brazil, Serra Ricardo Franco State Park was created in 1997 to protect a rare convergence of three of the country’s most important biomes: the Amazon, the Cerrado, and the Pantanal. This mosaic of ecosystems shelters extraordinary biodiversity, including species such as the caboclinho-do-sertão bird and the giant otter, both of which depend on intact habitats to survive.

Yet nearly a quarter of this protected area has already been stripped of its natural vegetation. Around 24% of the park has been deforested and converted into cattle pasture, despite its formal status as a state park. Instead of being a safe haven for wildlife and a vital buffer against climate breakdown, large parts of Serra Ricardo Franco have been carved up for industrial beef production.

At the centre of this destruction are farms operating inside the park, such as the Paredão farm. Cattle raised on these illegally deforested lands are sold to a ranch called Barra Mansa, which then supplies major slaughterhouses owned by JBS, Minerva, and Marfrig. Meat from these companies is exported to consumers around the world, embedding the destruction of a protected Brazilian park into global supply chains.

This is not happening in a regulatory vacuum. In 2009, JBS, Minerva, and Marfrig each made public commitments to monitor their suppliers and to exclude farms linked to deforestation from their supply chains. Yet the ongoing conversion of native vegetation inside Serra Ricardo Franco State Park, and the continued movement of cattle from deforested farms to these slaughterhouses, shows that these pledges have not been fulfilled in practice.

The consequences extend far beyond the borders of a single state park. Deforestation in Serra Ricardo Franco is part of a wider surge in forest loss across the Brazilian Amazon. As trees are cleared and ecosystems are fragmented, carbon once stored in forests is released into the atmosphere, accelerating the climate crisis. The loss of habitat also pushes wildlife into closer contact with humans and livestock, increasing the risk that zoonotic diseases will jump between species.

These risks are particularly stark in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has highlighted how environmental destruction and global health are closely linked. As forests are cut down and wild species are displaced, the chances of new disease outbreaks emerging and spreading can rise, with devastating consequences worldwide.

Protecting Serra Ricardo Franco State Park is therefore not only about safeguarding unique species and landscapes in Brazil; it is also about defending climate stability and reducing the risk of future pandemics. Laws that already exist to protect this park must be properly enforced, and deforestation within its borders must be stopped and reversed.

At the same time, the global meat industry must transform how it operates. Companies like JBS, Minerva, and Marfrig need to fully implement and strengthen their own commitments by rigorously monitoring all suppliers, including indirect ones, and cutting ties with any farms involved in deforestation. Without real accountability in these supply chains, promises made more than a decade ago will remain empty words, and protected areas like Serra Ricardo Franco will continue to fall under the axe and the plough.

Enforced protections on the ground, combined with genuine reforms in global beef supply chains, are essential if Serra Ricardo Franco State Park is to remain a living refuge for the caboclinho-do-sertão, the giant otter, and countless other species—and if the forests of Brazil are to continue playing their critical role in stabilizing the climate and protecting global health.
