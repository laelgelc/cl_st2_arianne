This week marked a turning point in the fight for climate justice, as science, courts, communities, and policymakers converged around a single, urgent message: time is almost up to prevent climate catastrophe, and governments must act now.

The week began with a stark warning from the world’s climate scientists. The latest IPCC report called for an urgent and unprecedented response from governments to keep global warming within safe limits and avoid the worst impacts of climate breakdown. It made clear that incremental change is no longer enough; what’s needed is a rapid, far-reaching transformation of our energy systems, economies, and societies.

Across Europe, this call to action was echoed in courtrooms. In the Netherlands, a landmark ruling mandated the closure of coal plants by 2020, underscoring that governments have a legal duty to protect their citizens from the dangers of climate change. In Germany, courts backed diesel car bans in Berlin, a major step toward tackling toxic air pollution and shifting away from fossil-fuelled transport. In Belgium, authorities were pushed to adopt a new air pollution plan, reflecting growing recognition that clean air is a basic right, not a luxury.

Financial institutions also came under pressure to align their decisions with climate science. NN Group, a major financial actor, announced it would stop funding tar sands projects, citing their extreme emissions. This move highlighted the growing consensus that high-carbon fossil fuel projects have no place in a climate-safe future and that money must flow instead into clean, sustainable alternatives.

At the political level, the European Parliament sent a powerful signal by backing a vision of net-zero emissions by 2050. This includes phasing out fossil fuels, dramatically increasing energy efficiency, and restoring ecosystems that can absorb carbon and help buffer communities from climate impacts. The Parliament’s position reflects mounting public and scientific pressure for Europe to lead by example and turn long-term climate goals into concrete, near-term action.

Momentum was also building among European governments. Fifteen EU countries came together to push for higher climate targets, signalling a growing bloc in favour of stronger, faster emissions cuts. Yet this shift played out against intense debates in key countries. In Germany, discussions over the future of coal exposed deep political fault lines, even as protests in and around the Hambach forest drew massive public attention. The struggle over whether to protect this ancient forest or expand coal mining became a powerful symbol of the broader choice facing Europe: cling to a fossil-fuelled past or embrace a cleaner, fairer future.

Taken together, these developments showed that the climate crisis is no longer a distant threat but a defining political, legal, and moral issue of our time. The IPCC’s warning, the court decisions, the financial shifts, the European Parliament’s stance, and the growing political will in many EU countries all point in the same direction. The tools, the science, and the public support for bold climate action are already here. What remains is for governments to move from words to deeds, and to do so at the speed and scale that justice and science demand.
