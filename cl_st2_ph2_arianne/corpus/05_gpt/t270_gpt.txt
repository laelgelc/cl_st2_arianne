Fifty years ago, a small group of activists set out from Vancouver with a simple but powerful idea: that ordinary people could confront governments and corporations threatening the planet, and that bearing witness to environmental harm could help stop it. In 1971, they sailed toward Amchitka Island in Alaska to protest a US nuclear weapons test. The boat they travelled on had been renamed “Greenpeace,” and that journey would shape the identity and direction of a global environmental movement.

Although the crew did not reach the test site, their action helped generate public pressure that contributed to the United States cancelling further nuclear tests on Amchitka. The voyage also inspired others to challenge nuclear testing elsewhere, including French nuclear tests, and helped show that non-violent direct action on the high seas could capture the world’s attention and bring environmental issues into mainstream debate.

Building on that early momentum, Greenpeace expanded its focus to other threats to the natural world. Anti-whaling campaigns became a defining feature of its work. Activists in small Zodiac boats positioned themselves between whales and whaling ships, placing their bodies in harm’s way to expose the brutality of industrial whaling. Images of these confrontations travelled around the world, helping to raise public awareness and galvanise opposition to commercial whaling. As support grew, Greenpeace evolved into Greenpeace International, coordinating campaigns across borders and oceans.

Half a century later, however, the environmental crisis has deepened. Despite decades of activism, scientific warnings, and growing public concern, global biodiversity continues to decline and greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise. These trends point to what many scientists describe as an ecological “overshoot” – humanity is demanding more from the Earth’s systems than they can sustainably provide.

In this context, the lessons of the past 50 years are stark. The founding journey toward Amchitka, and the anti-whaling campaigns that followed, showed that determined, visible action can help shift public opinion and political decisions. But the scale of today’s crisis demands much more profound change. Addressing ecological overshoot requires reducing both human population and overall consumption to bring our societies back within the planet’s limits.

Marking 50 years since that first voyage is therefore not just a moment for reflection on past victories. It is a reminder that the struggle for a just and sustainable relationship with the Earth is far from over, and that confronting overshoot is now at the heart of that struggle.
