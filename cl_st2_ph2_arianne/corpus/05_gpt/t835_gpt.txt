The bow of the Esperanza cuts through the deep-blue Atlantic off West Africa, and the first thing that hits you is how alive the ocean feels. These are nutrient-rich waters, and it shows. Whales and dolphins surface around the ship, pelicans and gannets patrol the waves, and flying fish scatter from the hull like silver arrows. At night, bioluminescent plankton shimmer in our wake, turning the sea into a trail of stars.

From the deck, this beauty can feel almost overwhelming. It’s a reminder of what’s at stake. Our journey here is not just to witness this richness, but to protect it. We are chasing illegal fishing vessels and documenting the damage that overfishing is inflicting on these waters and on the communities that depend on them. The contrast is stark: the ocean’s abundance on one side, and the clear signs of its depletion on the other.

Below the surface, the diversity continues. Coral reefs hide moray eels and lobsters among their crevices. These reefs are part of a wider web of life fed by powerful upwellings that bring nutrients from the deep ocean to the surface. These natural processes support entire ecosystems, from tiny plankton to large marine mammals.

Along the coast, mangroves line the shore. Their tangled roots are not only nurseries for countless marine species but also important carbon sinks, quietly storing carbon and helping to buffer the climate crisis. Nearby beaches play a different but equally crucial role: they are vital nesting grounds for endangered green sea turtles. Watching these animals return to lay their eggs on the sand underscores how closely linked land and sea really are.

Out on remote islands, the surprises continue. Marine hippos and manatees live in and around these coastal waters, sharing space with communities that have long lived in close symbiosis with nature. Life here is vibrant and deeply connected to the sea. Colorful attire brightens the shoreline, pirogues glide across the water, and music carries over the waves. These scenes are not just picturesque; they are living proof of cultures and livelihoods intertwined with healthy oceans.

Amid the grim reality of illegal fishing and the visible scars of overexploitation, it is this resilience and beauty that offer hope. The ocean still has the capacity to recover if we give it the chance. That is why calls for sustainable fisheries management are so urgent. Protecting these waters means protecting whales and dolphins, turtles and reefs, mangroves and manatees—and the coastal communities whose futures are bound to the health of the sea.

You can help by adding your voice and signing the petition for sustainable fisheries management. Each signature is a step toward giving these waters, and the people and wildlife who depend on them, a fighting chance.
