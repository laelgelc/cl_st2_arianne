World Meat Free Day is a powerful reminder that what we put on our plates shapes not only our own health, but the health of the planet we all share. Animal agriculture is a leading driver of water pollution, deforestation and climate change, and every meal is a chance to either fuel that destructive system or help transform it.

Choosing more plant-based foods is one of the simplest ways to reduce the pressure on forests, freshwater and the climate. When we cut back on meat, even for a single day, we send a message that we want a food system that protects ecosystems, respects animals and nourishes people.

To show how delicious and satisfying plant-based eating can be, Greenpeace ship chef Daniel Bravo Garibi is sharing two recipes that celebrate fresh, accessible ingredients and bold flavours: lentil ceviche and purslane salad with citrus vinaigrette.

Daniel has been a Greenpeace volunteer since 2003 and is a strong advocate for sustainable food procurement and reducing meat consumption. His cooking on board Greenpeace ships proves that climate-friendly meals can be vibrant, comforting and full of character. These recipes are designed to help you experience that in your own kitchen.

Lentil ceviche offers all the tang and freshness of a classic ceviche using lentils instead of fish. It’s a plant-based twist that highlights how pulses can be the star of the plate, providing texture, protein and richness without relying on animal products. The purslane salad with citrus vinaigrette is a bright, crunchy companion, showcasing seasonal greens and a zesty dressing that brings everything to life.

You can follow along step by step with written recipes and cooking videos, and there are Spanish versions available so more people can join in and enjoy these dishes in their own language. These resources are there to make it easy to turn World Meat Free Day into a practical, hands-on experience in your kitchen.

World Meat Free Day is not about perfection; it is about reflection and action. It is a chance to pause and ask how our daily food choices affect forests, rivers, the climate and communities around the world—and how small shifts, repeated over time, can help reform a system that is pushing planetary boundaries.

By trying these recipes, you are already taking a meaningful step. You can go further by sharing the dishes with friends and family, talking about why you’re reducing meat, and exploring more plant-based options in your weekly routine. Every shared meal is an opportunity to inspire someone else.

You are invited to:

- Cook Daniel’s lentil ceviche and purslane salad with citrus vinaigrette.
- Use the written recipes, videos and Spanish versions to guide you and share them widely.
- Share your own favourite plant-based recipes and tips with your community.
- Make a personal pledge to change at least one eating habit in a way that’s better for your health and the planet.

World Meat Free Day comes once a year, but the choices we make at breakfast, lunch and dinner happen every day. Each of those choices can either reinforce a destructive, polluting system—or help build a fairer, greener food future. Your plate is a powerful place to start.
