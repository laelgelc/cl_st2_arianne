Levi Strauss & Co. has just taken a major step towards a toxic-free future, responding to the demands of hundreds of thousands of people who have joined Greenpeace’s global Detox campaign. By committing to go toxic-free, Levi’s now stands alongside 11 other major fashion brands, including Zara, that have already pledged to eliminate hazardous chemicals from their supply chains.

This commitment follows a Greenpeace report and documentary that exposed how clothing factories in Mexico and other parts of the world are polluting local waterways. These investigations revealed how the production of everyday clothes can have a devastating impact on rivers and the communities that depend on them. Public pressure has been crucial in pushing brands to take responsibility for the toxic trail left by their products.

Levi’s has now committed to require its biggest suppliers in China, Mexico, and across the Global South to publicly disclose pollution data by June 2013. This transparency is a critical step towards accountability, making it possible for communities, campaigners, and consumers to see what is being released into their rivers. In addition, Levi’s will work to find and use non-hazardous alternatives to dangerous chemicals, and has agreed to adopt the precautionary principle—meaning it will act to prevent harm even when some scientific uncertainty remains, rather than waiting until damage is undeniable.

But the job is far from done. Many major fashion brands are still lagging behind. To increase the pressure on companies like Calvin Klein, GAP, and Victoria’s Secret to eliminate hazardous chemicals and stop polluting rivers, the Detox campaign is urging people everywhere to share the "Detox Fashion" video. By spreading this message, more consumers can learn about the hidden cost of cheap fashion and join the call for a truly clean and responsible clothing industry.

Levi’s decision shows that people power works—and that when enough voices demand change, even the biggest brands have to listen. Sharing the Detox Fashion video and supporting the Detox campaign can help ensure that all fashion brands follow suit and commit to a toxic-free future for our rivers and our communities.
