The air is thick with the smell of freshly cut wood, but there is no forest left to breathe it in. Where towering, ancient trees once stood, there is now only a raw, exposed scar on the land. The Great Northern Forest, a place that has nurtured life for centuries, has been reduced in this clearcut to a barren wasteland. The mossy ground that used to cradle mushrooms and lichen is torn open. The intricate web of branches and hollows that sheltered insects and birds is gone.

In this stripped landscape, the silence is striking. The rustle of wings, the hum of insects, the quiet work of fungi breaking down fallen wood – all of it has been pushed aside by heavy machinery and short-term profit. What was once a complex, living ecosystem has been flattened into uniform stumps and churned soil.

Forest campaigner Lina Burnelius from Greenpeace Nordic has been witnessing this destruction across the Great Northern Forest. She points to one of the key drivers behind it: Essity, the producer of Tempo and the world’s second-largest tissue company. Essity sources pulp from suppliers that are expanding into some of the most biodiversity-rich forests in Sweden, Finland, and Russia. These are not just any forests. They are critical landscapes where rare and sensitive species depend on old trees, dead wood, and undisturbed soil to survive.

When companies like Essity allow their supply chains to reach deeper into these last remaining rich forest areas, they help turn living, ancient ecosystems into industrial landscapes. The result is clearcut areas like this one – places where the forest’s memory has been wiped away in a single logging operation.

But this destruction is not inevitable. Essity has the power to change course. Instead of driving logging into critical biodiversity-rich forests, the company can choose to source wood from areas where logging does not threaten irreplaceable ecosystems. It can shift to sustainable forestry practiced outside these critical landscapes and significantly increase the use of recycled materials in its products.

This is not just about one clearcut, one company, or one product brand. It is about the future of the Great Northern Forest and the countless forms of life that depend on it. It is also about the choices made in boardrooms and supermarkets, and in the homes of people who use tissue products every day, often without knowing what has been lost to make them.

Essity’s customers and the wider public have a crucial role to play. By demanding a cleaner supply chain, they can push one of the world’s largest tissue producers to stop sourcing pulp from suppliers expanding into these critical forests. They can insist that companies like Essity protect the Great Northern Forest by using recycled materials and wood from areas where biodiversity is not put at risk.

The barren clearcut in the Great Northern Forest is a warning. It shows what happens when irreplaceable ecosystems are treated as disposable. But it can also be a turning point, if enough people stand up and insist that forests rich in life are worth more than short-lived tissue products made at their expense.

Every demand for change adds pressure on Essity to act responsibly. By calling on Essity to clean up its supply chain and keep critical biodiversity-rich forests off-limits to logging, we can help ensure that the Great Northern Forest remains a living home for insects, birds, mushrooms, and lichen – not a wasteland of stumps and silence.
