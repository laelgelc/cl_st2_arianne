Provisioning food for 25 people for three months at sea starts long before the ship leaves the dock. Before we sailed, the crew worked through lists, measurements, and menus, trying to imagine every breakfast, lunch, and dinner that would be eaten somewhere out on the Pacific. Dry goods, canned food, and frozen items were stacked, counted, and checked again. Fresh ingredients, which can’t last the whole journey, were planned around two key stops: Curacao and Panama. Those ports became essential waypoints not just on the map, but in our diet, where fruits, vegetables, and other fresh produce could be brought on board to keep everyone healthy and energized.

Once the pallets and crates arrived, the real work began. Every box had to be unpacked and every item stored in its proper place. On a moving ship, storage isn’t only about convenience; it’s about safety and practicality. Heavy items are secured low, fragile ones are carefully wedged or tied in, and everything is organized so the galley can function smoothly even when the waves are anything but calm. The ship’s corridors and storage rooms briefly transformed into a maze of food containers before settling into an ordered system that would feed 25 people, day in and day out.

Coming from Taiwan and being new to life at sea, I quickly learned that provisioning is only one part of surviving a long voyage. The other part is coping with seasickness. The first days brought unfamiliar motion and a stomach that didn’t quite know how to respond. I tried to spend as much time as possible in fresh air, focusing on the horizon and using simple breathing techniques to steady myself. Pills helped when the waves picked up, and I learned to avoid caffeine, which only made things worse. On board, our medic Loes was a constant source of support, checking in, offering advice, and helping me figure out what worked for my body in these new conditions.

The sea doesn’t always cooperate with meal schedules. When big waves hit, the galley becomes a place of controlled chaos. Pots and pans have to be held in place, ingredients grip the edge of counters, and everyone moves with a kind of rolling rhythm to keep their balance. Sometimes a sudden lurch sends utensils sliding and forces a quick rescue mission for anything not properly secured. Those same waves follow you into the night. Sleeping in bunk beds means feeling each swell as it lifts and drops the ship, turning rest into a series of gentle—or not so gentle—rocking motions that you eventually learn to accept as part of the routine.

Amid all this motion, our French chef Laurence manages to produce healthy, comforting meals that keep morale high. She plans dishes that can withstand the rolling conditions, making sure there is enough variety and nutrition to keep 25 people going for months. Volunteers, myself included, rotate through the galley to help with chopping, stirring, serving, and cleaning, all while bracing ourselves against the constant movement. It’s not just about cooking; it’s also about careful waste sorting, separating different types of waste so that as little as possible is thrown away and everything that can be handled responsibly is dealt with properly. In this floating home, every meal is a small collective effort, shaped by the sea, the ship, and the people who call it home for these months in the Pacific.
