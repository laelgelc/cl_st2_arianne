Pride began as a protest. In 1969, the Stonewall Riots were a response to inequality, discrimination, and violence against LGBTQ+ people. That history is at the heart of Pride: communities standing up together against injustice and demanding the right to live freely and safely.

The struggle for LGBTQ+ rights is deeply connected to the struggle for climate justice. Around the world, marginalized communities are the first and hardest hit by environmental crises. Those who already face discrimination and exclusion often have the least protection from pollution, extreme weather, and the destruction of their homes and livelihoods. A just and green future must include safety, dignity, and rights for everyone, including LGBTQ+ people.

Greenpeace celebrates diversity and supports LGBTQ+ rights as part of building that just future. Since 2018, the organisation has joined Pride events around the world to stand in visible solidarity and to help highlight the links between social and environmental justice.

The first of these was in Amsterdam in 2018, where Greenpeace joined Pride to affirm that environmental and human rights struggles belong together. In 2019, Greenpeace took part in Pride in Brazil, a country where LGBTQ+ people face high levels of violence, to stand with those resisting hatred and fear. The organisation then joined Pride in Mexico City, where laws advancing equal rights were moving forward, to support the momentum for change and underline that equality and climate justice go hand in hand.

In 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Greenpeace participated in Pride in Taiwan. There, the focus was on the connections between social justice and environmental justice, even in the midst of a global health crisis. Across all these moments, one message has remained constant: the fight for a safer planet and the fight for equal rights are inseparable.

Greenpeace pledges ongoing solidarity with LGBTQ+ communities everywhere. The organisation will continue to celebrate Pride, to stand against discrimination, and to work for a world where both people and the planet can thrive.
