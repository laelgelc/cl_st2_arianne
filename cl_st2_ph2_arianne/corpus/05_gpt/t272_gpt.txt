When I look back on my years as a Greenpeace photographer between 1974 and 1982, what comes first are not words, but images. A dozen particular photographs sit in my mind like doorways. Each time I revisit them, I step back into the spray, the noise, the fear, the laughter, and the stubborn hope that shaped those early years.

Some of the most searing memories come from confronting the Russian whaling fleets. Out on the open ocean, the scale of industrial whaling was overwhelming: vast steel ships, cranes, flensing decks, and the terrible moment when the harpoon cannon fired. From the deck of a small Zodiac, the sea towering around us, we would push in close between the whales and the harpooners, trying to block the shot and, at the same time, make photographs that could carry the reality of that violence to people who would never see it firsthand.

Those Zodiac runs were a constant negotiation between danger and documentation. The inflatable hull slapped against the swell; salt spray coated the lenses; the light changed by the minute. There were no second chances. You’d brace yourself against the rubber tube, one arm wrapped around a line, the other trying to keep the camera steady as the boat lurched. Focus, exposure, horizon—everything had to be decided in an instant, often as a whale surfaced or a harpoon flew. The sea didn’t care that we needed a clear frame.

In those days, our tools for sharing what we captured were almost as primitive as the boats we rode. There was no internet, no instant upload, no social media. Film had to be protected, labeled, shipped or carried by hand. Prints were made in darkrooms, then mailed, couriered, or physically carried into newsrooms. We relied on telephones, telexes, and word of mouth. A single image might take days or weeks to reach a newspaper editor, and yet we knew that once it did, it could travel further and faster than we ever could.

Bob Hunter called this the “mind-bomb” theory: the idea that a single powerful image could explode in people’s consciousness, shattering complacency and forcing them to see the world differently. Out there on the water, with cameras pressed to our faces and the smell of diesel and blood in the air, that theory felt very real. We weren’t just documenting events; we were trying to create images that could detonate in living rooms and offices, in parliaments and classrooms, and change the way people thought about whales, oceans, and our relationship with the natural world.

None of this happened alone. Captain John Cormack held our fragile operations together at sea, coaxing our ships into position with a mix of calm authority and stubborn resolve. Activists like Bree Drummond and Bobbi Hunter climbed into the Zodiacs and put their bodies between the whales and the harpoons, knowing that the cameras were rolling but never treating that as theatre. Their courage was the subject of many of the photographs I took; their presence in those frames gave the images their moral weight.

On land, support came from unexpected places. A Jerry Garcia benefit concert helped raise much-needed funds, turning music into fuel for the campaigns. Those nights of music and solidarity stood in sharp contrast to the harsh light and cold winds at sea, but they were part of the same story: people using whatever tools they had—guitars, cameras, boats—to push back against destruction.

Our early offices were as improvised as our sea campaigns. They were cramped, chaotic spaces full of maps, coffee cups, and stacks of photographs. From those rooms, Greenpeace began to grow beyond its local roots and move toward international expansion. Amsterdam became a key hub, a place where strategies were shared, crews assembled, and images dispatched around the globe. The walls there were plastered with prints—whales breaching, ships looming, activists in tiny boats—a visual record of a movement learning how to speak to the world.

Life with the crews was a world of its own. Long stretches of boredom at sea would suddenly snap into moments of intense action when a whaling fleet appeared on the horizon. We shared cramped bunks, traded stories, patched gear, and argued over tactics. The camera was my constant companion, but it was also a bridge: through it, I tried to capture not just the confrontations, but the quiet moments—the fatigue, the camaraderie, the doubts, and the stubborn belief that our presence on that patch of ocean mattered.

One photograph from those years stands out as truly iconic in the anti-whaling struggle. It shows the essential drama of those confrontations: a tiny Zodiac, activists visible in their bulky gear, positioned between a whale and a looming whaling ship. The scale difference is almost absurd, but that was the point. The image distilled everything we were trying to say into a single frame: that ordinary people could stand up to massive industrial forces, that compassion could confront cruelty, that the fate of a whale was tied to the choices humans make.

Looking back now, those photographs also carry another layer of meaning: they mark a moment in a much larger ecological transition. The end of commercial whaling in many countries, and the shift away from whale oil and whale products, didn’t just affect whales; it reshaped livelihoods and communities tied to that industry. Standing on deck with a camera, watching whalers work, it was impossible not to see that they, too, were caught in a system larger than themselves. The images we made helped accelerate public pressure for change, but that change had human costs as well as ecological benefits.

Those years from 1974 to 1982 taught me that photography can be both witness and catalyst. Each of those dozen photographs is a fragment of a larger story: of people in small boats facing down giant ships, of film canisters passed from hand to hand across continents, of offices buzzing with plans for the next voyage, of music and meetings and arguments and victories and losses. They remind me that an image, once released into the world, can take on a life of its own—shaping conversations, fueling movements, and helping societies navigate the difficult transitions that come with learning to live more gently on this Earth.
