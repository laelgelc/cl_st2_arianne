Growing up in the Blue Mountains, surrounded by forests and dramatic landscapes, shaped Sophie Marjanac’s deep connection to the natural world. That connection eventually led her into environmental law, but not in a straight line. At university, her activism and involvement in land rights work with Indigenous Australians opened her eyes to how deeply environmental protection is tied to people’s lives, cultures and rights. It was through this work that she came to see the environment and human rights as inseparable.

As an environmental lawyer with ClientEarth, Sophie now works at the intersection of these issues. She describes how climate change is no longer seen solely as a scientific or policy problem, but increasingly as a legal and human rights issue. Around the world, there is a growing wave of climate lawsuits being brought against governments and fossil fuel companies. Many of these cases are inspired by landmark decisions such as the Urgenda case in the Netherlands, where a court found that the government had a legal duty to protect its citizens from climate change.

These legal challenges are pushing institutions to recognise that failing to act on climate change can violate fundamental rights, such as the right to life, health and a safe environment. Sophie highlights that this shift is helping to hold powerful actors to account, and to make clear that climate inaction has real human consequences.

Not every case succeeds, and there have been setbacks. Courts can be conservative, and legal systems are often slow to adapt to the scale and urgency of the climate crisis. Sophie stresses the importance of persistence in the face of these obstacles. Even where cases are lost, they can build public awareness, generate new legal arguments and lay the groundwork for future victories.

She points to the groundbreaking investigation in the Philippines into the human rights impacts of major fossil fuel companies—the so-called carbon majors. This process examined whether these companies could be held responsible for human rights harms linked to climate change. For Sophie, this represents a significant development in recognising corporate accountability for the climate crisis and its effects on communities.

Sophie also underscores that environmental and human rights defenders should not face these battles alone. Her advice is to seek support from existing networks that are dedicated to protecting those on the frontlines, whether they are lawyers, activists, Indigenous leaders or community organisers. These networks can provide legal help, solidarity and protection for people who take on powerful interests.

Despite the scale of the challenge, Sophie draws hope from the passion and determination of young people demanding climate action. She sees a generation that understands the stakes, refuses to accept inaction and is willing to use every tool available—from protest to the courtroom—to push for a safer, more just future. Their energy and commitment, she suggests, are a powerful force driving change in climate law and beyond.
