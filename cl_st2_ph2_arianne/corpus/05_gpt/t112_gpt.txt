Across the African continent, communities are mobilising to protect forests, rivers, oceans, and the climate. Yet this growing environmental movement is being held back by a deeper force: the unfinished business of decolonization.

The structures that drove colonial-era extraction of raw materials are still in place. Then, as now, African land, water, and people are treated as expendable in the pursuit of profit for distant elites. The result is a pattern that repeats across countries and regions: ecosystems are degraded, local economies are distorted, and communities are left to bear the costs of a crisis they did not create.

In Nigeria, the legacy of Shell’s operations is a stark example. Decades of oil pollution have damaged farmlands, poisoned water sources, and undermined livelihoods, while the wealth generated has overwhelmingly flowed abroad or into the hands of a small elite. This is not an isolated case; it reflects a wider model in which Africa’s resources are extracted, exported, and processed elsewhere, with minimal benefit for the people who live closest to the damage.

The Democratic Republic of Congo shows another face of this injustice. Vast areas of forest are being cleared, even as many people in the country live in deep poverty. Instead of forests serving as a foundation for resilient local economies and community well-being, they are treated primarily as reservoirs of timber and land for commercial exploitation. This disconnect between resource wealth and human development is a hallmark of a system designed around external demand rather than local needs.

That system is not a relic of the past. Today, multinational corporations and foreign-backed projects continue to push new frontiers of extraction across the continent. Oil drilling in Namibia, pipelines planned and built in East Africa, and auctions of oil and gas blocks in the DRC are being promoted as development opportunities. In reality, they lock African countries into a fossil-fuelled path that intensifies the climate crisis and deepens dependence on volatile global markets.

These projects go ahead even as climate impacts are already hitting African communities hard. Floods destroy homes and crops. Droughts undermine water security and agriculture. Rising food prices make basic necessities harder to afford. The same global economic model that drives extraction also leaves people on the frontlines of climate breakdown, with the least resources to adapt or recover.

For Africa’s environmental movement to succeed, it cannot limit itself to fighting individual projects or companies. It must confront the underlying structures that treat African territories as sacrifice zones and African societies as mere suppliers of raw materials and cheap labour. That means linking climate and environmental justice with the broader struggle for decolonization.

Decolonization in this context is not only about political sovereignty or changing flags; it is about transforming the economic and cultural models that still privilege Western interests and ways of thinking. Many post-independence leaders adopted Western development blueprints that prioritised export-led growth, large-scale extraction, and top-down planning. These models have too often sidelined the knowledge, values, and priorities of local communities.

A different path is possible—one that draws from long-standing African traditions of collaboration, reciprocity, and respect for nature. Across the continent, people have long organised life around shared resources, communal land management, and social safety nets rooted in kinship and community. These values can form the basis of economies that are less extractive and more regenerative, less focused on individual accumulation and more focused on collective well-being.

Building such economies requires African leaders to move away from copying Western models and instead centre local realities, aspirations, and knowledge systems. It means strengthening inward-focused economies that prioritise meeting people’s needs over serving distant markets. Rather than seeing informal activities as obstacles to “modernization,” they can be recognised as spaces of resilience, creativity, and mutual support that already sustain millions of people.

Local innovation is key. When communities have the power and resources to shape their own solutions—whether in energy, food systems, housing, or transport—they are better able to create livelihoods that do not depend on destructive extraction. This can include supporting small-scale farmers, fishers, and forest communities who protect ecosystems while feeding and caring for their neighbours. It also means valuing the ingenuity found in informal settlements, markets, and cooperatives, where people constantly adapt and invent ways to survive and thrive despite systemic neglect.

An environmental movement rooted in decolonization will challenge not only fossil fuel companies and logging firms, but also the political and economic arrangements that enable them. It will question who makes decisions about land and resources, whose voices are heard, and whose interests are served. It will insist that African people, especially those most affected by pollution and climate impacts, have the power to define what development and prosperity mean for them.

This is not a call to isolation, but to sovereignty and self-determination. Africa’s struggles against oil drilling in Namibia, pipelines in East Africa, and resource auctions in the DRC are part of a global fight for climate justice. Yet they are also specific battles against a long history of external control and exploitation. Aligning environmental activism with decolonization makes it possible to address both at once.

As climate disasters intensify—bringing more floods, harsher droughts, and ever-rising food prices—the urgency of this transformation grows. Continuing on the current path means locking in more extraction, more inequality, and more vulnerability. Choosing a different path means centring collective well-being, respecting nature, and trusting in the power of local communities and knowledge.

Africa’s environmental movement has the potential to be a powerful force for change, not only on the continent but worldwide. For that potential to be realised, it must break with the colonial patterns that still shape economies and politics, and instead root itself in traditions of solidarity, care, and reverence for the land. Without decolonization, environmental victories will remain partial and fragile. With it, they can form the foundation of a more just, resilient, and life-affirming future.
