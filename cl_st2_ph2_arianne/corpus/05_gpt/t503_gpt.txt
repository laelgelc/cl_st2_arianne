President Jair Bolsonaro’s Provisional Presidential Decree (PPD) 910 opens the door for a sweeping amnesty to those who have illegally occupied and deforested public lands in the Amazon between 2008 and 2018. Instead of punishing environmental crime, this measure effectively rewards it, turning areas that were grabbed and cleared in violation of the law into legally recognized private holdings.

PPD 910 extends land regularization to occupations that occurred before May 2014, and there is the possibility of this cut-off being pushed to 2018. It also makes the process easier for larger properties, allowing the regularization of areas up to 15 tax modules, which can be equivalent to as many as 1,650 soccer fields. By simplifying and expanding access to land titles for these large areas, the decree transforms land grabbing from an illicit practice into an officially endorsed pathway to property ownership.

This is not a solution to land conflicts or rural poverty; it is a false solution that formalizes land grabbing and signals that deforestation pays. When those who invade and clear public lands are later rewarded with legal titles, it encourages a cycle of new invasions and further deforestation. The consequences reach far beyond individual properties: they undermine the environmental balance of the Amazon, threaten biodiversity, and accelerate the climate crisis.

PPD 910 also harms Indigenous rights. The expansion of land regularization over illegally occupied areas increases pressure on territories that should be protected, including Indigenous lands and other traditional territories. Public heritage is put at risk when public lands—meant to serve the collective interest, safeguard ecosystems, and uphold the rights of forest peoples—are handed over to those who profited from environmental destruction.

Brazil does not need more amnesties for environmental crimes or shortcuts that reward land grabbing. What is urgently needed is a robust, transparent system for land management based on unified, reliable databases that clearly identify public lands, protected areas, Indigenous territories, and private properties. Alongside this, oversight and enforcement bodies must be strengthened so they can effectively prevent new invasions, stop illegal deforestation, and hold violators accountable.

Protecting the Amazon means standing with those who defend it on the ground: Indigenous Peoples, traditional communities, and other forest guardians. Rejecting measures like PPD 910 and demanding policies that truly safeguard public lands, uphold rights, and protect the forest is essential to securing the Amazon’s future—and our own.
