In Douala, Cameroon, plastic waste is not just an eyesore – it is a direct cause of recurring floods that destroy homes, livelihoods, and even lives. As drains and gutters fill up with discarded plastic bottles and packaging, rainwater has nowhere to go. Streets turn into rivers, houses are inundated, and families lose the few possessions they have. The floods contaminate water sources, damage food supplies, and undermine people’s health and safety.

This is the reality that Nathalie Wamja, a Greenpeace volunteer in Douala, witnesses again and again. Her motivation is deeply personal: family members and friends have been directly affected by these floods. Walking through her city, she sees plastic bottles and packaging clogging the gutters, even though some plastic imports are already banned. For her, these scenes are a clear sign that partial measures are not enough.

Nathalie is calling for a total ban on plastic production and imports. In her view, only a complete shift away from single-use plastics can make space for truly sustainable alternatives, such as refill and reuse systems. She believes that when plastic is no longer an option, businesses and communities will be pushed to adopt solutions that do not end up choking the city’s drainage and poisoning its environment.

In her daily life, Nathalie is already living the change she wants to see. She strives to live plastic-free, reusing items instead of throwing them away and refusing unnecessary plastic wherever she can. When she shops, she talks with vendors about why she avoids plastic and encourages them to consider more sustainable options. Her personal choices are a form of quiet resistance to a system built on disposability.

Nathalie’s activism also extends far beyond her own household. She regularly shares information and awareness-raising articles via WhatsApp, and circulates petitions to push for stronger policies on plastic. She helps organize clean-up activities in collaboration with local associations, bringing people together to remove plastic from streets and waterways. During these clean-ups, she conducts brand audits to identify which companies’ products are most often found polluting the environment.

Through this work, Nathalie has seen that cleaning up is important but not enough on its own. No matter how many bags of plastic are collected, more keeps coming. She emphasizes that without systemic change – including a total ban on plastic production and imports and a shift to refill and reuse – communities like hers will remain trapped in a cycle of pollution and flooding.

For Nathalie, every plastic-free choice, every conversation with a vendor, every shared article, petition, and clean-up is part of a larger effort to protect her city from preventable disasters. Her experience in Douala shows how plastic is not just a waste problem, but a driver of climate vulnerability and social injustice – and why bold action on plastics is urgently needed.
