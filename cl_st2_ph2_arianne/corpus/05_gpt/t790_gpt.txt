Greenpeace’s ship, the Arctic Sunrise, is heading south on a three‑month voyage to help secure the creation of an Antarctic Ocean Sanctuary – which would be the largest protected area on Earth, covering an area six times the size of Italy.

On board is a team of campaigners, scientists, and journalists. Together, they will explore seabed habitats, document how industrial fishing is affecting penguins and whales, and shine a light on some of the biggest threats facing the Antarctic: overfishing, plastic pollution, and climate change.

This year, leaders from 24 countries and the European Union will decide whether to create this vast sanctuary in the Antarctic Ocean. Their decision is expected in October 2018, and what happens in that meeting room will have consequences far beyond Antarctica itself.

Healthy oceans are vital for wildlife, for people’s livelihoods, and for the stability of our planet. Protecting the Antarctic Ocean would give penguins, whales, and countless other species a safe haven, and help safeguard the ecosystems that so many communities ultimately depend on.

You can help make this sanctuary a reality. Add your name to the petition calling on politicians to back the Antarctic Ocean Sanctuary, and share it with your friends, family, and networks. The more of us who speak up, the harder it will be for world leaders to ignore the call to protect the Antarctic and the global oceans we all rely on.
