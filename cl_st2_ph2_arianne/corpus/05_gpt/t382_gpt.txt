Every year on November 21, World Fisheries Day shines a spotlight on the importance of sustainable small-scale fisheries and the communities that depend on them. These fisheries often represent a lifeline for coastal communities, providing food security, livelihoods, and a way of life that is closely tied to the health of the ocean.

But this day also exposes a much darker reality in the global fishing industry, especially in distant water fisheries (DWF). As fish stocks decline, industrial vessels are forced to travel farther out to sea to maintain their catch. This drive to keep profits high in the face of dwindling resources has fueled an industry model where cutting costs becomes a priority at almost any human or environmental expense.

Behind the scenes of this system are migrant workers who are often subjected to serious human rights abuses, including forced labor. Isolated at sea for long periods, far from oversight or support, these workers can be trapped in abusive conditions while corporations continue to profit. The distance from shore doesn’t just hide environmental harm—it also hides the exploitation of people.

This exploitation is not confined to a single company or region, but investigations have brought specific cases to light. Greenpeace has linked the Taiwanese company FCF to forced labor and illegal fishing. Reflecting these concerns, the US Department of Labor has listed Taiwan for practices involving forced labor in its fishing industry. These findings underscore how systemic and entrenched such abuses can be in distant water fleets.

Despite these serious issues, seafood from abusive and illegal operations can still make its way into global markets. A major reason is the failure of many buyers to carry out robust due diligence. When companies do not properly check where and how their seafood is caught, they risk selling products that are tainted by human rights abuses and illegal fishing.

Addressing this problem requires action from both governments and consumers. Governments must enforce strong protections for workers at sea and ensure that fishing operations are monitored and held accountable. This includes cracking down on illegal fishing and ensuring that labor rights are upheld throughout the supply chain.

Consumers also have power. By reducing seafood consumption and choosing local, sustainable options when they do eat seafood, people can help shift demand away from exploitative and destructive fishing practices. Supporting small-scale, sustainable fisheries and demanding transparency from retailers and brands can contribute to building a fairer, more responsible seafood industry—one that respects both people and the ocean.
