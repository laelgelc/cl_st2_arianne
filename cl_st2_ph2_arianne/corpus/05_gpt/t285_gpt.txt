Along the shore of Anse Royale in Seychelles, local people are working together to restore a natural ally in the fight against climate breakdown and pollution: mangrove wetlands.

As part of the Vital Ocean Voices series, their story reveals how coastal communities around the Indian Ocean are confronting destructive fishing, pollution, and a changing climate by protecting and rebuilding the ecosystems that sustain them.

In Anse Royale, the Watershed Committee, which includes community members like Terence Vel and Monica Samson, has been leading mangrove restoration through a program that began in 2016. The work is rooted in Ecosystem-Based Adaptation – using nature itself as protection and support for people and livelihoods.

The initiative includes mangrove nurseries, community planting activities, and workshops that bring local residents into every step of the process. This hands-on involvement builds a sense of ownership and care for the wetlands, turning restoration into a shared community project rather than an external intervention.

These mangrove wetlands are doing vital work. They help combat flooding along the coast, provide habitat for a rich variety of marine and coastal life, and filter pollution that would otherwise flow into the ocean. For fishers, healthy mangroves mean more secure livelihoods, as these ecosystems support the fish populations they depend on.

In the past, mangroves in Anse Royale were damaged and destroyed by settlement and development. Through the community’s restoration efforts, the area has seen a recovery in diversity, with mangrove species increasing from three to six. This change reflects both ecological renewal and the power of community engagement in defending coastal ecosystems.

The experience of Anse Royale shows how local leadership, practical restoration, and deep community involvement can help protect coasts and livelihoods in the face of climate breakdown and environmental degradation.
