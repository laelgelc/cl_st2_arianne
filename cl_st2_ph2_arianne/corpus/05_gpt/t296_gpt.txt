Jeremy Raguain, a Seychellois conservationist, has issued an urgent open letter to leaders of Western Indian Ocean islands, calling on them to confront the mounting climate and ecological crises with decisive action. Writing from the perspective of someone deeply rooted in the region, he highlights how unsustainable fishing, over-tourism, fossil fuel exploration, and the looming threat of deep seabed mining are undermining the very foundations of island life, economies, and cultures.

He warns that the choices leaders make now will determine whether island communities can survive and thrive in a rapidly changing world, or whether they will be pushed further into vulnerability. In doing so, he lays out six clear solutions he believes island leaders must adopt if they are to protect their people, their waters, and their future.

First, he calls for a ban on fish aggregating devices (FADs) and the strict application of the polluter pays principle. FADs, he notes, are driving unsustainable fishing practices that endanger marine ecosystems and the livelihoods that depend on them. By banning these devices and ensuring that those who cause environmental harm bear the costs of their actions, leaders can start to restore balance in the ocean.

Second, he urges governments to assess environmental and social carrying capacities before approving new hotel and tourism developments. Over-tourism is already placing enormous pressure on fragile island ecosystems. Raguain argues that without proper limits and clear understanding of what these environments can sustain, the rush for tourism revenue will continue to erode the natural assets that make these islands unique.

Third, he calls for a moratorium on fossil fuel exploration. At a time when islands are among the most exposed to climate impacts, he argues that pursuing new fossil fuel projects is incompatible with safeguarding their future. A moratorium would signal a commitment to a different development path, one that does not deepen dependence on the very fuels driving climate breakdown.

Fourth, Raguain insists that island leaders must reject deep seabed mining through precautionary measures. With so much still unknown about deep ocean ecosystems, he underscores the risks of allowing mining in these environments, particularly when the potential damage could be irreversible. A precautionary approach, he argues, is not optional but essential.

Fifth, he advocates expanding marine protected areas across the region, including the designation of the Saya de Malha Bank as a UNESCO site. Strengthening protections for key marine areas would help safeguard biodiversity, support fisheries, and bolster resilience to climate impacts. Saya de Malha, in particular, is highlighted as a place worthy of international recognition and protection.

Sixth, he calls on island leaders to support a strong Global Ocean Treaty. Such a treaty, he suggests, is a critical tool for protecting the high seas and ensuring that ocean governance reflects the needs and rights of vulnerable coastal and island communities, not just the interests of powerful industrial actors.

Throughout the letter, Raguain is clear that this is a moment of choice. He warns that if current leaders fail to act on these solutions, they risk losing the trust and mandate of the people they represent. In that case, he suggests, they should expect to be replaced by leaders who are willing to confront the climate and ecological emergency head-on and defend the Western Indian Ocean islands with the urgency and courage the moment demands.
