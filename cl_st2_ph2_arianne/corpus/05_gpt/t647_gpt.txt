In 2018, Greenpeace’s iconic ships — the Rainbow Warrior, Esperanza, and Arctic Sunrise — carried our environmental message across the globe, from the icy waters of Antarctica to the vibrant reefs of Australia. Each voyage brought powerful stories, unforgettable encounters, and striking visual moments that captured both the beauty of our planet and the threats it faces.

The Rainbow Warrior, Esperanza, and Arctic Sunrise acted as true global flag bearers throughout the year. They sailed to Antarctica, documenting one of the most fragile and awe‑inspiring ecosystems on Earth. Their journeys took them to Hawaii and Taiwan, where they continued to bear witness to environmental challenges and support local and regional efforts for protection. In New Zealand, the ships helped shine a light on important marine and coastal issues, while in Papua’s dense forests they supported work to expose and challenge destructive practices in one of the world’s most biodiverse regions. The ships also reached Australia’s Great Southern Reef, highlighting another critical marine ecosystem that deserves protection and care.

Across these voyages, the ships were not just means of transport, but moving platforms for documentation and challenging actions. They carried crew, activists, scientists, and storytellers who worked together to record what they saw and to confront environmental destruction wherever they encountered it. The images that emerged from these journeys show both the scale of the challenges and the determination of people standing up for the planet.

The 10 best images from 2018 bring this all together: moments on deck in wild seas, quiet scenes in remote forests, and snapshots of life and resistance in communities around the world. Each photograph offers a window into the work of Greenpeace’s ships and the people who sail on them.

These visual stories were shaped and shared by Greenpeace International’s Multimedia Editor, Sudhanshu Malhotra, who is based in Hong Kong. For those who want to see more of this work and follow these journeys more closely, Sudhanshu’s photography and storytelling can be found on Instagram.
