Last night I dreamt that my son came running up to me, eyes shining, begging for the latest video game console on sale for Black Friday. In the dream, he was surrounded by screens, flashing discounts and “limited-time offers,” his excitement fuelled by an endless stream of ads and brand logos. I remember feeling torn: wanting to make him happy, but also feeling a deep sadness that his idea of joy was so tightly wrapped around a plastic box and a discount tag.

When I woke up, I realised the nightmare wasn’t really about a console. It was about the world we’re building for our children.

What I want for my son are memories rooted in nature: muddy shoes after a long walk in the forest, the thrill of spotting a bird he’s never seen before, the quiet awe of watching a sunrise. I want his happiest moments to come from what he does, not what he owns. But it’s hard to raise a child on those values in a culture where consumerism is treated as a way of life, and where the loudest voices are those of advertisers telling us we’re not enough unless we buy more.

This pressure to overconsume is not just a personal problem; it shapes our cities and our climate. Cities are responsible for nearly three-quarters of global emissions, and our current way of living is so resource-hungry that we would need 1.8 Earths to sustain it. That number is more than a statistic—it’s a warning that the way we produce, sell and buy things is pushing the planet beyond its limits.

The burden is not shared equally. The richest 10% of people are responsible for an estimated 36–45% of global emissions. Their lifestyles, and the systems built to serve them, are driving climate breakdown, destroying nature and undermining global food supplies. While many people are struggling to afford basic necessities, a small minority is living in a way that the Earth simply cannot support.

If we want a livable future, we need to change the rules that reward this excess. That means putting in place measures like carbon taxes that target the super‑rich, instead of asking those who have done the least to cut back even more. It means finally phasing out fossil fuels, instead of allowing them to remain the invisible engine behind our consumption and our cities.

But system change is also about culture: about the stories we tell ourselves and our children about what it means to live well. We can promote low‑carbon lifestyles that focus on reusing, repairing and sharing, and on choosing experiences over objects. Borrowing instead of buying, swapping instead of discarding, fixing instead of replacing—these are not sacrifices, but steps toward a life less cluttered by things and richer in meaning.

Advertising plays a huge role in shaping our desires. Today, it relentlessly promotes overconsumption, especially in urban spaces where billboards, screens and branded content are impossible to escape. Regulating advertising—especially for the most polluting products and lifestyles—is essential if we want to free people, and especially children, from constant pressure to buy more.

Ultimately, this is about what we teach the next generation. If children grow up believing that happiness comes from the latest gadget or fashion trend, we lock them into a cycle that harms both them and the planet. If they grow up learning that joy can be found in relationships, creativity, time in nature and shared experiences, we give them a different path.

When I think back to that nightmare, I remind myself that it doesn’t have to be our future. We can choose to build cities where life is measured not in shopping bags but in clean air, green spaces and time spent together. We can choose policies that hold the biggest polluters and the super‑rich accountable. And we can choose, every day, to show our children that the best moments in life are not bought—they’re lived.
