Our oceans are in trouble, but there is a clear and achievable way forward.

Greenpeace, together with leading scientists, is calling for a bold rescue plan: a global network of ocean sanctuaries that would cover at least 30% of the world’s oceans by 2030. These sanctuaries would be fully protected, with bans on fishing, mining, and drilling in key areas identified using the best available data on habitats, species, and climate impacts.

This is a very different vision from so‑called “paper parks” – protected areas that exist in name only and fail to stop destructive activities. The proposed sanctuaries would come with strict rules and real enforcement. To make that possible, Greenpeace is pushing for a new UN body under a strong Global Ocean Treaty, with the authority and tools needed to ensure that protections are not just promised, but delivered.

Why does this matter so much? Oceans are essential to life on Earth. They provide much of the oxygen we breathe, food for billions of people, and a powerful buffer against climate breakdown. Healthy oceans absorb heat and carbon, support rich webs of marine life, and help stabilize our climate.

Establishing a robust network of sanctuaries would give marine ecosystems the space they need to recover and thrive. In fully protected areas, marine life can become more abundant and diverse, and these thriving sanctuaries can boost the resilience of ocean wildlife and habitats to mounting threats such as climate change and pollution.

But this transformation will not happen automatically. Powerful industries that profit from exploiting the oceans are already pushing back against strong protections. That is why public support is critical. People everywhere can play a role in demanding that governments stand up to industry pressure and agree to a Global Ocean Treaty strong enough to create and enforce this network of sanctuaries.

By backing this plan and calling for at least 30% of the oceans to be fully protected by 2030, we can help secure a safer future for marine life, for the climate, and for all of us who depend on a living, thriving ocean.
