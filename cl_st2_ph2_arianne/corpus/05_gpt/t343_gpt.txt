Nearly fifty years ago, a small group of activists set out from Vancouver to protest U.S. nuclear tests near Amchitka Island, off Alaska. That inaugural voyage helped give birth to Greenpeace. During Women’s History Month, it is essential to recognize the women whose vision, courage, and persistence made that journey—and the movement it sparked—possible.

Dorothy Stowe was a co-founder of Greenpeace and a source of stabilizing leadership at a time when the fledgling organization was still defining its identity. Her commitment and guidance helped hold people together through uncertainty and internal tensions. In a campaign that challenged powerful governments and military interests, her steady presence anchored the effort.

Marie Bohlen played a pivotal role by proposing the idea that became the core tactic of the Amchitka protest: sailing directly to the U.S. nuclear test site. She also co-founded the Don’t Make A Wave Committee, the group that organized the voyage and laid the groundwork for what would become Greenpeace. Her strategic insight—to confront nuclear testing by placing a small boat and its crew in harm’s way—helped define the kind of non-violent, direct action that has characterized Greenpeace ever since.

Dorothy Metcalfe supported the mission from shore, relaying media reports to the crew at sea and encouraging them to persist when conditions were difficult and the outcome uncertain. She also lobbied Canadian Members of Parliament, pressing political leaders to act. Her work helped connect the crew’s courageous stand on the water with the public and political pressure needed on land.

Zoe Hunter contributed in ways that shaped both people and logistics. She introduced Bob Hunter to pacifism, influencing the philosophy that underpinned the voyage and future Greenpeace actions. She also helped provision the ships, ensuring the crew had what they needed to undertake a risky and demanding journey.

The crew that actually sailed toward Amchitka was all male, and this is now recognized as a mistake. That decision overlooked the essential contributions women were already making—not just behind the scenes, but at the heart of the strategy, organization, and moral vision of the campaign. The story of the Amchitka voyage is incomplete without acknowledging that women co-founded the organization, conceived the central tactic, sustained the effort through communications and political advocacy, and helped shape the movement’s values.

Honoring Dorothy Stowe, Marie Bohlen, Dorothy Metcalfe, and Zoe Hunter during Women’s History Month is not only about correcting the historical record. It is about recognizing that from Greenpeace’s earliest days, women were indispensable to its founding, its first great voyage, and its ongoing commitment to non-violent environmental action.
