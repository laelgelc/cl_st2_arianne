Savio Carvalho’s recent visit to Berap village in West Papua began with a simple but powerful act: walking the land alongside Indigenous leaders of the Namblong tribe as they carefully mapped their clan boundaries. On the surface, it looked like a technical exercise in drawing lines on a map. In reality, it was a strategy of survival.

These maps are being created to block palm oil plantation permits that threaten the forests the Namblong people have depended on for generations. By documenting where each clan’s territory begins and ends, and how these areas are used, the community is building a crucial legal and political shield against companies that see their land only as a site for profit.

At the heart of this struggle is a groundbreaking lawsuit led by Hendrikus “Franky” Woro, an Indigenous leader from the community. Franky is challenging a permit granted to a Malaysian company on traditional Namblong lands. The case is remarkable not only because it confronts a powerful corporate actor, but because it asserts, in a formal legal setting, that Indigenous land rights and forest protection must come before the relentless drive to expand commodity frontiers.

Franky’s case is emblematic of a broader fight across West Papua, Indonesia, and the world: a fight against deforestation driven by a global economic system that treats forests as expendable raw material. The demand for commodities like palm oil continues to push companies into ever more remote and ecologically rich areas, turning living forests into industrial landscapes. This pattern is not accidental; it is a direct outcome of a capitalist model that prioritizes short-term profit over the long-term health of people and the planet.

The consequences are not only environmental but deeply cultural. In Jakarta, at a Papuan cultural festival, these themes surfaced again and again in conversations with young Papuans. They spoke about forest conservation and the violence they face from the state when they try to defend their lands. They discussed what it means to be Papuan in a context where their identity, culture, and territories are constantly under threat.

A recurring lament was the loss of local foods like sago, a staple that has sustained Papuan communities for generations. As forests are cleared and traditional lands are converted into monoculture plantations, sago becomes harder to find. The disappearance of sago is not just about diet; it is about the erosion of knowledge, rituals, and relationships to place that define who people are. When a forest is destroyed, an entire web of life, memory, and meaning is destroyed with it.

Yet, running through both Berap and the Jakarta festival was a strong current of resistance and hope. The Indigenous leaders mapping their lands and the young people debating their future share a commitment to protecting their forests and cultures. They are not only opposing destructive projects; they are asserting alternative ways of living with the land—ways rooted in reciprocity, respect, and long-term stewardship.

On World Forest Day, these stories carry an urgent message. Ending global deforestation is not just a technical or policy challenge; it is a moral and cultural imperative. Forests are among the richest reservoirs of biodiversity on Earth. Allowing them to be sacrificed for commodities undermines the stability of the climate, the survival of countless species, and the rights and futures of Indigenous peoples.

The struggle in West Papua shows that protecting forests is inseparable from defending Indigenous rights and cultures. It also shows that real, lasting change depends on transmitting Indigenous wisdom to younger generations, so they can continue to challenge destructive systems and imagine new ones. Cultural resistance—through language, food, art, and everyday practices—becomes a form of environmental defense.

On this World Forest Day, the work of people like Franky Woro and the Namblong community, and the voices of Papuan youth in Jakarta, remind us that forests are not just carbon stocks or resources. They are homelands, teachers, and living archives of knowledge. Ending deforestation to protect biodiversity means standing with those who are on the frontlines, ensuring that their wisdom, rights, and visions for the future guide the systemic changes our world so urgently needs.
