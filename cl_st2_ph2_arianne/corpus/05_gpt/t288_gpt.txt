In 2021, extreme weather events around the world gave a stark reminder that the climate crisis is already here. Deadly floods swept through parts of Europe and New York, turning streets into rivers and overwhelming infrastructure that was never designed for such intense rainfall. In central China and Uganda, catastrophic flooding destroyed homes and livelihoods, leaving communities to pick up the pieces after waters receded. These weren’t isolated freak events; they were part of a global pattern of escalating climate impacts.

At the same time, unprecedented heatwaves hit Canada and Morocco, pushing temperatures to dangerous levels. Cities baked under extreme heat, with serious consequences for people’s health, energy systems and food supplies. In Japan, heavy rains triggered destructive mudslides, while in India, cloud bursts unleashed sudden, torrential downpours that devastated communities in minutes. Each of these events showed how exposed and vulnerable cities and towns have become as the climate crisis accelerates.

Climate change is no longer a distant warning. It is speeding up, and our urban centres – where so many people live and work – are on the frontlines. The scale and frequency of these disasters reveal how unprepared many places are, and how urgently we need robust early warning systems, better planning and coordinated responses that protect the most vulnerable first. Without these, every new storm, heatwave or flood will hit harder than the last.

But better emergency response is only one part of the story. The root causes of the crisis must be confronted. Extractive industries, especially fossil fuels and industrial agriculture, continue to drive emissions while clinging to colonial business models that exploit people and nature. These industries pour resources into greenwashing to protect their image, even as they resist the deep and rapid cuts in emissions that science demands. Their influence has delayed action for decades, and people are paying the price with their lives and homes.

With just 100 days to go before COP26, the world cannot afford more delay or half-measures. Governments must break with the interests of extractive industries and commit to real, transformative change. That means rapidly phasing out fossil fuels, ending destructive agricultural practices, and investing in resilient, just and sustainable societies.

Above all, world leaders must act to keep global temperature rise capped at 1.5ºC. Every fraction of a degree matters. The floods, heatwaves, mudslides and cloud bursts of 2021 are a warning of what lies ahead if we fail. Bold, decisive action now can still limit the damage, protect communities and give future generations a fighting chance.
