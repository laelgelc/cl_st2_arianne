Industrial fishing is tearing through our oceans, leaving devastated seabeds, collapsing wildlife populations and broken promises to the coastal communities that depend on the sea for food and livelihoods. This week’s failure by the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC) to agree on conservation measures for overfished yellowfin tuna is another stark example of how profit is still being put before the planet.

At the IOTC meeting, urgently needed protections for yellowfin tuna were blocked by the European Union and powerful industrial fishing interests from France and Spain. Instead of backing measures that could help a critically overfished species recover, these actors chose to protect short-term gains. This decision effectively gives the green light for continued overfishing, despite clear warnings that yellowfin tuna in the Indian Ocean is at risk of collapse by 2024.

The consequences reach far beyond a single species. Tuna are a vital part of marine food webs; their decline ripples across entire ecosystems, putting sharks and many other ocean animals under further pressure. Industrial fleets, with their massive capacity and destructive gear, don’t just target tuna – they damage seabeds, catch vulnerable species as bycatch, and undermine the very foundations of ocean health.

For small-scale fishers in countries like Mauritius and Seychelles, this is not an abstract policy failure. It is a direct threat to food security, income, and cultural traditions tied to the sea. While distant-water industrial fleets scoop up dwindling fish stocks, local communities are left with less and less to live on.

This is happening in an ocean that is already on the brink. Only about 1% of the world’s oceans are properly protected, while around 93% of fish populations are overfished. Without strong, enforceable protections, the pattern is clear: industrial interests push ecosystems to collapse, and the people least responsible pay the highest price.

A strong Global Ocean Treaty is urgently needed to turn this around. Such a treaty can create vast ocean sanctuaries where marine life can recover, free from industrial exploitation. These safe havens are essential if we are to restore fish populations, protect wildlife like sharks and tuna, and secure the future of coastal communities.

This is a moment for governments to choose: continue siding with industrial interests, or act in the interests of people and planet. Join the calls to pressure governments to back a strong Global Ocean Treaty and to support real protections for the high seas. Our oceans cannot afford more delays.
