For decades, neoliberal policies have promised prosperity through deregulation, privatisation and so‑called “free trade.” Yet when crises hit – from Covid‑19 to accelerating climate breakdown – these same policies have left communities with dangerously few options. Supply chains snapped, essential goods became scarce or unaffordable, and governments often seemed more accountable to markets than to people or the planet.

This is not an accident; it is a feature of an economic model that treats efficiency and corporate profit as higher priorities than resilience, justice and ecological limits. Free trade rules have been written and enforced in ways that systematically favour large corporations, while the social and environmental costs are pushed onto workers, communities and ecosystems. Jobs are offshored to wherever labour and environmental protections are weakest, local industries are hollowed out, and people are told this is the unavoidable price of “competitiveness.”

In the face of overlapping crises, that story is collapsing. We need a different approach: relocalisation that builds resilient, sustainable supply chains and strong communities. Relocalisation is not about isolation or nationalism. It is about internationalism and solidarity grounded in the understanding that people everywhere deserve dignified work, secure access to essentials, and a safe environment. Instead of a race to the bottom, it means cooperating across borders to raise standards, share knowledge and support each other’s transitions.

This requires a fundamental rethinking of trade rules. Trade must be organised around human dignity, fair wages and ecological sense rather than around corporate prerogatives. That means asking basic questions that current rules often ignore: Does this trade arrangement protect workers’ rights? Does it respect ecological limits? Does it help diversify economies instead of locking them into extractive or low‑wage roles? Does it strengthen communities’ capacity to weather shocks?

Tariffs, long treated as taboo in neoliberal orthodoxy, can be part of a more just and sustainable toolkit. Used thoughtfully, they can help countries diversify their economies, support local and regional production, and manage transitions away from polluting industries. They can offer breathing room for sectors that are essential for social and ecological resilience but cannot compete on a playing field tilted towards corporate giants exploiting cheap labour and lax environmental rules.

However, tariffs alone are not enough. To truly support a just transition, they must be paired with strong social policies that ensure everyone can access the basics of a good life. Affordable housing is crucial so that people are not priced out of their communities as local economies shift. Basic income or similar guarantees can provide security during periods of economic change, giving workers the freedom to move into new, more sustainable sectors without facing destitution.

Relocalisation, fair trade rules and supportive social policies together can create economies that are both more resilient to crises and more aligned with climate and social justice. Instead of being locked into fragile global supply chains and extractive industries, communities can build diverse, low‑carbon livelihoods that meet real needs. Instead of accepting that corporations are the primary beneficiaries of trade, we can insist that trade serves people and the planet.

The frustration so many feel with the current system is justified. Crises like Covid‑19 and climate change have exposed how dangerous it is to rely on a model that strips away public capacity, undermines local resilience and treats environmental breakdown as an acceptable cost of doing business. Changing course means challenging the dominance of neoliberal ideas and rebuilding our economies around solidarity, democracy and ecological responsibility.

That work is already beginning in many places, through campaigns for stronger labour rights, climate‑conscious industrial policy, community‑owned energy, local food systems and more democratic control over trade decisions. The task now is to connect these efforts, deepen international solidarity and push for trade and economic rules that put human dignity, fair wages and ecological sense at their core.
