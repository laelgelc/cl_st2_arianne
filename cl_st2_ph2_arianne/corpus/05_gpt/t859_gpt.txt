Stretching in a vast green belt around the Arctic, the Great Northern Forest – also known as the boreal forest or Taiga – is one of the planet’s most important natural defenses against climate change. Beneath its surface lies a powerful, often overlooked ally: carbon-rich soil that stores more carbon than tropical forests. This immense underground reservoir helps keep greenhouse gases out of the atmosphere, slowing the pace of global warming.

This forest is also a sanctuary for wildlife uniquely adapted to its extremes. Species such as the Siberian Tiger, bears, and salamanders depend on these ecosystems for their survival. Life here must withstand dramatic seasonal swings, with Siberian winters plunging to around -35°C and summers rising to about 25.5°C. 

Animals have evolved remarkable strategies to cope with these conditions. Some change their coat colour with the seasons to stay camouflaged in snow or summer foliage. Others produce antifreeze-like chemicals in their bodies to prevent ice crystals from forming in their tissues. Many species enter hibernation, slowing their metabolism to survive the long, harsh winters when food is scarce.

The forest’s trees are no less extraordinary. Conifers such as pine and spruce are built to resist freezing. Their needles contain little sap, reducing the risk of damage in sub-zero temperatures, and their shapes help them absorb precious sunlight during short northern days. These adaptations allow them to endure year after year, forming ancient stands that anchor the forest ecosystem.

Protecting these ancient trees and the life they support is crucial for the climate and for biodiversity. The Great Northern Forest is not just a distant wilderness; it is a living shield against climate breakdown. Its survival depends on collective action. Joining the effort to safeguard this forest means standing up for a stable climate, thriving wildlife, and a healthier planet for generations to come.
