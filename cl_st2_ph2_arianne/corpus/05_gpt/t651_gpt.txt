At the UN climate talks at COP24 in Katowice, Poland, people from coal-affected communities came together to demand an end to coal and a rapid shift to renewable energy. Their stories, rooted in lived experience, underscored how urgent it is to move away from fossil fuels as climate impacts worsen.

From Indonesia, a young activist described how coal pollution harms health and tears at the fabric of communities. She spoke about the daily reality of breathing dirty air and watching neighbours get sick, and how this personal experience pushed her into action. At COP24, she took that message directly to decision-makers, even climbing structures to confront climate denial head-on — including the denial she has encountered within her own family, from her father. Her protest was a call to recognise the human cost of coal and to stop ignoring the damage it causes.

In Poland itself, residents of Imielin are resisting plans to expand a coal mine that threatens to destabilise their homes and cause building collapses. Their struggle is not only about protecting their houses, but also about defending their right to a safe place to live. The people of Imielin have drawn strength from and built connections with other movements, such as the protests at Hambach Forest in Germany, where activists have also stood up against coal expansion. This growing web of solidarity shows that local fights against coal are part of a wider, global movement for climate justice.

Voices from within Poland’s own coal heartlands are also calling for change. A Silesian activist from a coal-mining family is demanding a just transition away from coal — one that protects workers and communities while ending dependence on fossil fuels. She points out that wind energy is now cheaper than coal, challenging the idea that coal is the backbone of affordable power. For her, and for many others, Poland has a chance not just to follow, but to lead on climate action by embracing renewables and planning a fair, managed phase-out of coal.

Together, these testimonies from Indonesia, Imielin, and Silesia brought a clear message to COP24: coal is damaging people and the climate right now, and the solutions are already within reach. Ending coal use and accelerating the shift to renewable energy, while ensuring justice for affected communities, is not only necessary — it is both possible and urgent.
