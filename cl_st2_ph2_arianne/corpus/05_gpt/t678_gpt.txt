In late October, governments from around the world will gather in Hobart, Australia, to decide the fate of one of the most important ocean protection proposals on the planet: a vast Antarctic Ocean Sanctuary in the Weddell Sea. If agreed, this sanctuary would cover nearly two million square kilometers, making it the largest protected area on Earth.

The proposal, led by the EU, would create a refuge in the icy waters of the Weddell Sea where industrial fishing is restricted. This protection is vital for the wildlife that depends on these waters, including whales and penguins, which are already under pressure from global threats such as pollution and climate change. By limiting industrial activity, the sanctuary would help safeguard food sources, breeding grounds and migration routes for these species.

Antarctica’s ocean is also a crucial carbon store. Its cold, rich waters help absorb and lock away carbon, playing a significant role in stabilising the global climate. Protecting this region is not just about conserving wildlife—it is also about helping to keep our climate in balance.

The decision will be taken at a meeting of the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), which brings together 24 countries and the European Union. CCAMLR works by consensus, meaning every single member must agree. Just one objection could block the Weddell Sea sanctuary or force it to be weakened.

Alongside the Weddell Sea proposal, there are additional plans on the table to create a wider network of Antarctic Ocean sanctuaries. Together, these could form a shield for some of the most pristine and vulnerable waters on Earth, offering a buffer against the combined impacts of overfishing, pollution and a rapidly changing climate.

More than two million people around the world have already voiced their support for the Weddell Sea sanctuary. Their backing shows that this is more than a technical negotiation—it is a major opportunity for governments to respond to global public demand for strong ocean protection.

In Hobart, governments will face a clear choice. They can seize this moment to create the largest protected area on Earth and help secure the future of Antarctic wildlife and our climate, or they can allow a single objection to stand in the way. The world will be watching to see whether they choose to protect the Antarctic Ocean when it matters most.
