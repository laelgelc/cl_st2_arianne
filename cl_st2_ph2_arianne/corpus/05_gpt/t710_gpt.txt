In September 2013, the Arctic Ocean became the backdrop for a confrontation that would resonate far beyond the ice. The “Arctic 30” — 28 Greenpeace activists and two journalists — set out aboard the Dutch-flagged ship Arctic Sunrise to protest against Arctic oil drilling at Gazprom’s Prirazlomnaya platform. Their action, aimed at drawing attention to the risks of Arctic oil exploration, quickly escalated into an international legal dispute.

Russian authorities seized the Arctic Sunrise in international waters and towed it to Murmansk. All 30 people on board were arrested and jailed for two months. The charges and detention sparked widespread concern and debate about the treatment of peaceful protest, the rights of journalists, and the extent of Russia’s jurisdiction over a foreign-flagged vessel in international waters.

Following their release on bail and subsequent amnesty, the story did not end. In March 2014, the Arctic 30 brought a case before the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR). They argued that their detention had been unlawful and that their right to freedom of expression had been violated. Their case sought recognition that peaceful environmental protest and the work of journalists covering such actions must be protected rather than criminalised.

Parallel to this, the Netherlands — whose flag the Arctic Sunrise flies — brought its own case against Russia before an international tribunal. In 2017, the Netherlands won that case, a significant step in affirming the rights of flag states and the protections owed to vessels operating under international law. However, while that ruling addressed state-to-state issues, it did not resolve the individual human rights claims of the Arctic 30 themselves.

On 12 July 2018, the Arctic 30 submitted detailed arguments to the ECtHR. Their submissions are supported by the NGOs ARTICLE 19 and the Media Legal Defence Initiative, reflecting broader concern within the human rights and media freedom communities. Together, they are asking the Court to hold a hearing on the case. Such a hearing would give the Arctic 30 an opportunity to present their arguments in full and seek a ruling on whether their detention and the restrictions placed on their protest and journalistic work violated the European Convention on Human Rights.

As of now, the European Court of Human Rights has not set a date for its decision. The outcome remains pending, and with it, crucial questions about how far states can go in responding to peaceful protest at sea, and how robustly international human rights law will protect those who speak out against environmental destruction.
