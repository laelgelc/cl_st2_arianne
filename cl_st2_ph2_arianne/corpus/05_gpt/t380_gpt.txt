Greenpeace International, together with 350 organizations from around the world, is calling out the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) for signing an agreement with CropLife International – the powerful lobby group representing pesticide and genetically engineered seed corporations such as Bayer, BASF, and Syngenta.

The FAO describes this agreement as a way to help transform agri-food systems, promote rural development, and strengthen farmers’ resilience to climate change through investment and innovation. But by partnering with CropLife, the FAO is effectively giving profit-driven multinationals greater legitimacy and influence over how global food systems are shaped and governed.

This is deeply troubling. Corporations represented by CropLife have a direct commercial interest in expanding the use of chemical pesticides and genetically engineered seeds. Allowing them a stronger role in global food policy risks sidelining approaches that put people and the planet first, and further entrenching an industrial farming model that has already caused widespread environmental harm and social injustice.

Critics of the agreement stress that the FAO is ignoring key alternatives and long-standing recommendations. Agroecology – farming that works with nature, not against it – is a proven pathway to healthier ecosystems, resilient livelihoods, and climate-friendly food production. Food sovereignty – the right of people and communities to define their own food and agriculture systems – is essential for justice, democracy, and local resilience.

These principles are not new. The 2009 International Assessment of Agricultural Knowledge, Science and Technology for Development (IAASTD) recommended shifting away from a narrow focus on industrial, input-intensive agriculture and towards diversified, ecological, and farmer-centered systems. Instead of building on these recommendations, the FAO’s agreement with CropLife moves in the opposite direction, reinforcing the power of corporations whose business models depend on selling more pesticides and proprietary seeds.

By choosing to partner with a pesticide and biotech lobby, the FAO is undermining its own mandate to end hunger and promote sustainable agriculture. It risks locking farmers and communities into dependency on costly inputs, eroding biodiversity, and worsening the climate and ecological crises.

Greenpeace International and hundreds of allied organizations are urging the FAO to change course. Public institutions must serve the public interest, not corporate profit. That means rejecting partnerships that hand over influence to pesticide and seed multinationals, and instead prioritizing ecological farming and agroecology as the foundation of future food systems.

For a healthy planet and a just food system, the FAO must stand with farmers, communities, and nature – not with the corporations driving industrial agriculture.
