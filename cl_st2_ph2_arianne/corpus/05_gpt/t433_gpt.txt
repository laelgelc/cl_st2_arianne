When streets emptied and factories fell silent during COVID-19 lockdowns, something remarkable happened above our heads: the air cleared. Across the world, reduced use of fossil fuels, shuttered factories and a dramatic drop in transport emissions led to cleaner skies and healthier air.

In India, people shared images of the Himalayas visible from cities that hadn’t seen the mountain range for decades. In many places, levels of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) fell, showing just how quickly air quality can improve when pollution from traffic and industry is cut.

But as restrictions have eased, pollution has begun to rebound. In countries like China and the Philippines, as factories restart and traffic returns, dirty air is creeping back. The brief glimpse of blue skies and clear horizons is at risk of becoming just a memory.

This moment is a crossroads. The choices governments make about how to rebuild economies will shape our air, our health and our climate for years to come. Recovery packages can either lock us back into fossil fuel dependence and toxic air, or they can accelerate a green transition.

A sustainable recovery means directing stimulus away from polluting industries and towards clean solutions. That includes investing in renewable energy instead of fossil fuels, so that power generation no longer poisons the air we breathe. It also means rethinking how we move: expanding and improving green transport options like safe bike lanes, public transport and electric vehicles to cut emissions from cars, trucks and buses.

Stronger emission regulations are essential to keep air pollution down as economies reopen. Clear, enforced limits on pollutants from factories, power plants and vehicles can prevent the return of the worst smog days and protect people’s health.

Individual choices matter too. Many people discovered during lockdowns that less travel and more working from home are possible for at least part of the week. Keeping some of these changes—fewer unnecessary flights, more remote work, choosing walking, cycling or public transport where possible—can help reduce pollution and climate-wrecking emissions.

Clean air is not just an environmental issue; it sits at the intersection of health, climate and the economy. Breathing easier means fewer health problems, lower healthcare costs, and more resilient communities. Cutting air pollution also reduces greenhouse gas emissions, helping to tackle the climate crisis while building a fairer, more sustainable economy.

Greenpeace is campaigning to ensure that clean air is at the heart of post-pandemic recovery plans. The brief, clearer skies of lockdown showed what is possible. Now governments, businesses and individuals must choose to make that cleaner air permanent.
