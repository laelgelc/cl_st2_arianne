Across the world, air pollution is poisoning the air we breathe — and it’s not just in Beijing or Delhi. From Europe to Asia and beyond, cities are regularly exceeding safe pollution levels, and a major culprit is still the same: fossil fuel-powered vehicles clogging our streets and filling our lungs with toxic fumes.

To mark the EU’s Green Week, Greenpeace volunteers and allies across Europe took to the streets to demand cleaner air and a different kind of city — one built for people, not for cars.

In Berlin, volunteers highlighted just how skewed our streets have become. Cars occupy around 60% of street space, while cyclists are left with just 3%. By making this imbalance visible, they showed how current transport priorities lock us into pollution, congestion and unsafe streets, instead of supporting cleaner, healthier ways of moving around.

In Paris, activists braved the rain to cheer on cyclists, turning a wet day into a celebration of those choosing a cleaner mode of transport. Their support sent a clear message: people who bike through the city are doing their part for cleaner air and deserve streets that protect and encourage them.

In Rome, campaigners unfurled a banner calling on politician Nicola Zingaretti to take responsibility for tackling the city’s toxic air. By naming decision-makers directly, they underlined that air pollution is not an abstract problem — it’s a political choice, and it can be changed.

In Moscow, cyclists joined forces with the group Let’s Bike It to raise awareness of the health impacts of air pollution. By getting people onto bicycles and into the streets, they demonstrated that cleaner transport solutions are already here, if governments choose to back them.

Across Belgium, creativity powered the protests: banners, bike-powered events and flashmobs all drew attention to the urgent need to move beyond fossil fuel vehicles. These actions showed that people are ready for bold change — and that they’re prepared to speak out until they get it.

These street actions are part of a growing movement demanding clean air, safer streets and an end to our dependence on fossil fuel cars. Greenpeace will keep up the pressure on governments and car companies to act. The more people who get involved, the stronger that pressure becomes.

If you want to be part of this change, Greenpeace is inviting you to sign up and join the ongoing efforts to reclaim our streets and our air.
