In September 2019, people around the world took to the streets to demand serious action on the climate crisis. More than seven million people in 180 countries joined what became the largest global climate demonstration in history. Young people, especially those organizing through groups like Fridays For Future, were at the heart of this moment, calling on governments to act with the urgency that science demands.

The protests were as diverse as the places they took place. In Moscow, activists tag-teamed their demonstration to navigate restrictions on public gatherings. In Kabul, marches were held under protection, showing the courage it takes to stand up for the climate in dangerous circumstances. In Nairobi, people wore outfits made from plastic, turning the problem of pollution into a visible, powerful statement. Across Latin America, countless events showed how deeply the climate crisis is felt across the region.

These mobilizations brought together a wide range of people and groups. Trade unions, NGOs, grandparents, teachers, and parents all joined the youth on the streets. The demonstrations were marked by creativity: vibrant colors, handmade banners, music, and dance transformed public spaces into powerful calls for change.

Then the COVID-19 pandemic reshaped public life and made mass gatherings impossible in many places. Instead of stopping, the climate movement adapted. On April 24, 2020, activists shifted to digital strikes, using online tools to keep the pressure on decision-makers. Their demands focused on green legislation, including measures like the Green New Deal, to ensure that recovery from the pandemic would also mean progress on climate justice.

Social media and digital technology became crucial tools to stay connected. They allowed people from different countries and backgrounds to participate, share messages, and debate ideas in real time. Even without marching side by side, the movement found new ways to make itself heard and to keep pushing for the climate action the world urgently needs.
