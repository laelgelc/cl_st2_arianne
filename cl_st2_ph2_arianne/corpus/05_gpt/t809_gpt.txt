For more than a decade, coal has been the world’s dominant source of power and the single largest driver of climate change. It has held the top spot in the global energy mix since 2003 and is the biggest source of CO2 emissions, while coal mining itself releases significant amounts of methane, another potent greenhouse gas. Even as some politicians, including Donald Trump, have tried to revive and protect fossil fuels, the world is beginning to move in a different direction.

New research from Greenpeace and CoalSwarm reveals that 23 countries, states, and cities are now planning to phase out coal by 2030. Among them are three G7 economies, with Italy also potentially joining this group. Taken together, these commitments would mean shutting down or avoiding the construction of 370 coal-fired power plants. That’s enough capacity to power six countries the size of the UK. It also represents the planned retirement of coal assets worth around half a trillion US dollars.

This shift is not happening in a vacuum. Around the world, people are standing up to demand clean air, a safe climate, and a rapid transition to renewable energy. From the early battles against new coal plants at places like Kingsnorth in the UK, to the determined clean air activists in Delhi, a global movement has been building for years. Local communities, health professionals, climate campaigners, and ordinary citizens are uniting behind a clear message: it’s time to move beyond coal and accelerate the roll-out of renewable energy.

The emerging wave of coal phase-out plans shows that this pressure is working. Even in the face of political attempts to lock in fossil fuels, governments and cities are starting to chart a different course—one that moves away from coal and opens the door to cleaner, safer energy systems.
