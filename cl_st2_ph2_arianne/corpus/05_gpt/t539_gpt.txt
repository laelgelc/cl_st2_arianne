All around the world, people are refusing to stay silent in the face of the climate emergency. While political leaders continue to stall and delay, millions are stepping into the streets to demand the action that science says is urgently needed.

Over the last two Fridays, more than seven million people have joined climate marches, making them the largest climate protests in history. Students and school children have been at the heart of this wave of action, leading the way and showing what real courage looks like.

From Wellington to Washington and in roughly 4,000 places across the globe, streets have filled with colour, sound and creativity. Marchers have carried giant globes, marched alongside towering puppet oil CEOs, and used art, music and theatre to call out the fossil fuel industry and demand a safe future. These powerful displays have turned city centres into galleries of resistance and hope, transforming public spaces into reminders that the climate crisis affects everyone, everywhere.

The latest global climate strike brought some of the most striking and imaginative actions yet. These creative masterpieces do more than catch the eye – they tell the story of a generation refusing to accept business as usual, insisting that leaders listen to scientists and act at the scale the crisis demands.

But this movement is not a one-off event. The call is clear: keep going. Weekly climate strikes will continue until leaders finally heed the science and take meaningful, transformative action. The next global strike is on November 29, and everyone is invited to be part of it.

If you’ve never joined a climate strike before, this is the moment to start. Show up. Bring your friends, your family, your colleagues. Add your voice to the millions already demanding change. Each person who joins makes the message louder: in a climate emergency, inaction is not an option.
