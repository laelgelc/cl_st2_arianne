The GAIPE investigation into the 2016 murder of Honduran Indigenous leader and environmental defender Berta Cáceres lays out a stark and disturbing picture of how corporate, state, and financial interests converged against a community resisting a destructive project.

According to the investigation, the company behind the Agua Zarca dam, Desarrollos Energéticos S.A. (DESA), did not act alone. Planning, execution, and cover-up of the crime began as early as November 2015. DESA is described as having deployed its own security structures and hired hitmen to target Lenca activists who opposed the dam. Beyond direct violence, the company also used its influence over law enforcement to repress and criminalize those defending their territory and river.

The Honduran government is identified as having protected DESA throughout this period. Rather than safeguarding Berta Cáceres, a woman who had already received threats and was internationally recognized for her work, the state denied her effective security. At the same time, government forces were directed against the dam’s opponents, deepening the climate of fear and impunity around the project.

Financing banks, whose money made the Agua Zarca dam possible, are also called out in the report. Despite mounting evidence of repression, threats, and attacks on Lenca communities and their leaders, these banks continued to back the project. The investigation highlights how their failure to act in the face of clear warning signs helped enable a context in which violence could escalate.

Berta Cáceres’ murder is not presented as an isolated event. The report situates her killing within a global pattern of rising attacks on environmental and land defenders. In 2016 alone, 200 environmental defenders were killed worldwide. Honduras is highlighted as one of the places where these attacks are most intense and systemic, with violence used as a tool to silence opposition to projects imposed on Indigenous and rural communities.

The GAIPE findings underscore that justice in Berta Cáceres’ case cannot be limited to those who pulled the trigger. It must reach those who planned, financed, protected, and then tried to cover up the crime. The report points to the urgent need to confront the structural forces behind the murders of environmental defenders in Honduras and globally, and to ensure that those who defend rivers, forests, and territories can do so without paying with their lives.
