In Embalenhle, a township in South Africa’s Mpumalanga Highveld, the air people breathe is shaped by coal-fired power plants, refineries like Sasol, and intensive mining activities. For many residents, this pollution is not an abstract issue—it is something they feel in their lungs and see in the illnesses affecting their families and neighbours.

Community activist Fana Isaac Sibanyoni has made it his mission to challenge this reality. Living in one of the country’s declared pollution hotspots, he has seen how high levels of nitrogen dioxide (NO₂) and sulphur dioxide (SO₂) contribute to respiratory illnesses, cancer, strokes and premature deaths. These are not just statistics; they represent lives cut short and communities under constant health strain.

Fana’s work centres on making sure that the constitutional right to a clean and healthy environment is not just words on paper. He engages directly with municipalities, companies and local communities, pushing authorities to take responsibility for the air people breathe. By bringing affected residents together with decision-makers, he helps build pressure for stronger regulation and enforcement.

Education is a key part of his approach. Fana focuses on helping people understand where pollution comes from, how it affects their health and what rights they have. This knowledge, he believes, is essential for holding both government and industry accountable. When communities understand the links between emissions from coal plants, refineries and mines and the illnesses they experience, they are better equipped to demand change.

In 2022, a court ruling affirmed the rights of Mpumalanga Highveld residents to cleaner air, recognising the severe impacts of pollution in the region. Yet despite this legal victory, Fana and his community still face resistance. Industries and government authorities often ignore their concerns, and the promised improvements in air quality have been slow to materialise.

Against this backdrop, Fana continues to organise, speak out and insist that the right to a clean environment must be realised in practice, not just acknowledged in law. For him and many others in Embalenhle, the struggle for breathable air is ongoing—and deeply rooted in the demand for dignity, health and justice.
