Our oceans are the blue heart of our planet. They provide half of the oxygen we breathe and are a vital source of food for a billion people. At the same time, they absorb huge amounts of carbon, helping to slow the pace of climate change. Yet the very systems that keep our world alive are under growing pressure from destructive industries and a lack of effective global protection.

Far from coasts and out of sight, the open ocean is often treated as a dumping ground or a limitless resource. In reality, these waters are home to a rich web of life. Beneath the surface lie vast mountain ranges and deep trenches, supporting extraordinary marine ecosystems. Many of these areas are still largely unexplored, but we know enough to understand that they are crucial for biodiversity, for climate regulation, and for the livelihoods of people around the world.

Right now, most of these international waters are poorly regulated or not regulated at all. That leaves them vulnerable to overfishing, pollution, and emerging industries that see the ocean only as a frontier to exploit. To change this, governments are negotiating a new UN Ocean Treaty. This treaty could finally give the world a way to create ocean sanctuaries on the high seas—large, fully protected areas where marine life can recover and thrive, free from destructive human activity.

A strong UN Ocean Treaty would allow us to put in place a global plan to protect at least one-third of the world’s oceans. This would mean setting aside vast sanctuaries in the open ocean, including around underwater mountains and in deep-sea trenches, where life is especially diverse and vulnerable. Science shows that well-designed, well-managed protected areas help fish populations rebound, safeguard habitats, and make marine ecosystems more resilient to climate change.

To help secure this protection, a Greenpeace team aboard the ship Esperanza is undertaking a year-long expedition from the Arctic to the Antarctic. Traveling from the North Pole to the South Pole, they will document the threats facing our oceans, support scientific research, and bear witness to the beauty and fragility of marine life in some of the most remote places on Earth. Their journey will help build the case for ambitious ocean sanctuaries and bring the reality of the high seas into public view.

But while many governments recognize the need for ocean protection, powerful industries are working behind the scenes to weaken the treaty. They want to keep the high seas open for business as usual, even if that means sacrificing the health of marine ecosystems and the stability of our climate. To counter this pressure, a strong wave of public support is essential.

Everyone has a stake in the outcome of these negotiations. Whether you live in a coastal community or far from the sea, your life is tied to the ocean’s health through the air you breathe, the climate you depend on, and the global food systems that feed millions. By adding your name to the petition calling for a strong UN Ocean Treaty, you can help ensure that world leaders hear a clear message: the high seas must be protected, not plundered.

Protecting one-third of our oceans from destructive activities is an ambitious goal, but it is also a necessary one. With a robust treaty, effective enforcement, and public backing, we can create a global network of ocean sanctuaries that safeguards marine life, supports communities, and strengthens the planet’s resilience to climate change. The Esperanza’s journey is one step in this effort. The next step is ours.
