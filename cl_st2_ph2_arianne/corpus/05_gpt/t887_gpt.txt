When the OSPAR nations met in Tenerife, they had a historic chance to protect one of the most fragile places on Earth. Instead, they failed to establish an Arctic sanctuary. Norway, Denmark, and Iceland refused to even enter negotiations, and with that refusal they left the Arctic’s international waters open to destructive fishing and future oil drilling at the very moment the region needs protection most.

From the deck of the Greenpeace ship Arctic Sunrise, volunteer deckhand Paloma saw what is now at stake. Sailing from Svalbard into uncharted northern waters, she watched the Arctic unfold in front of her in a way that no meeting room or policy paper could ever capture. The ship passed towering ice formations, vast glaciers calving into the sea, and snow‑capped mountains rising starkly from the water. Seals rested on drifting ice, birds wheeled overhead, and every shift of light revealed a new side of this remote, fragile world.

For Paloma, who had already spent years campaigning against oil companies, the experience was overwhelming. She had long understood, in abstract terms, what was being threatened by fossil fuel expansion and industrial exploitation. But being there in person—hearing the crack and roar of ice breaking, seeing the scale of the glaciers, watching wildlife move through this harsh, beautiful environment—made the stakes feel painfully real. The Arctic was no longer just a place on a map or a talking point in a campaign; it was a living, breathing world that could be lost.

That is why the failure in Tenerife cuts so deeply. While governments sidestep responsibility and powerful countries block progress, the Arctic remains vulnerable. Without a sanctuary, its high seas are exposed to destructive fishing practices and the looming threat of oil drilling, even as the climate crisis accelerates and the ice retreats. Every delay in protection increases the risk that decisions made far from the ice will irreversibly damage this unique region.

Paloma’s journey aboard the Arctic Sunrise left her with a clear conviction: witnessing the Arctic’s beauty comes with a responsibility to act. She is calling on others to raise their voices, to demand that leaders return to the table and finally agree to protect this extraordinary place. The Arctic cannot speak for itself. It depends on people everywhere—whether they have stood on the deck of a ship in northern waters or only imagined that frozen horizon—to insist that it is safeguarded from destructive industry.

The failure in Tenerife is not the end of the story. It is a reminder that public pressure matters, that silence only benefits those who want to keep exploiting the Arctic, and that every person who cares about this fragile world has a role to play. Paloma’s message from the Arctic is simple: having seen what could be lost, she refuses to give up—and she is asking others to join her in demanding the protection the Arctic urgently needs.
