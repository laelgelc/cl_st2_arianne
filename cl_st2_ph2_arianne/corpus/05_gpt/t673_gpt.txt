After eight years of sustained public pressure and campaigning, one of Europe’s biggest tuna companies, Bolton, has taken a significant step toward more responsible fishing.

Back in 2011, Bolton was a clear laggard on sustainability. Now the company has committed that half of all the tuna it sources will come from more selective fishing methods such as pole and line or fish-aggregating-device (FAD)-free purse seining. This marks a 22% increase in the share of its tuna that must come from these more selective methods, which are designed to reduce the amount of unintended marine life caught in tuna nets.

Bolton has also pledged to cap the number of FADs it uses at 300 and to prohibit the use of supply vessels, both of which are important measures for reducing bycatch and limiting the broader ecological impact of industrial tuna fishing.

These moves come on the heels of landmark commitments by Thai Union last year, following major Greenpeace campaigns targeting destructive practices in the tuna industry, including overfishing, high levels of bycatch, and serious labor abuses at sea. Together, these changes at leading tuna companies indicate growing momentum across the sector to better protect both the oceans and the workers who depend on them.

This progress is a direct result of people taking action: writing letters, joining campaigns, and demanding better standards from the brands behind the cans on supermarket shelves. It shows that sustained public pressure can help push even the largest seafood companies to change course.

But the work is far from over. As Greenpeace continues to press companies to improve their policies and practices, we are also calling for strong protections at sea, including the creation of an Antarctic ocean sanctuary. Strong company commitments and ambitious ocean sanctuaries are both essential parts of safeguarding marine life and ensuring that tuna and other species have a future in our oceans.
