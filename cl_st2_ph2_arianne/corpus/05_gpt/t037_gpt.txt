When I think about why I’m here in Jamaica, at the International Seabed Authority conference, it’s not because I love being in conference rooms or navigating UN processes. I’m here because of my whakapapa, because of my deep connection to the land and the ocean as someone of Ngāpuhi, Ngāti Wai, Ngāti Porou, and Ngāti Whatua o Kaipara.

I’ve travelled with Pacific activists aboard Greenpeace’s Arctic Sunrise to be present in this space where decisions are being made about the future of the deep sea. For us as Indigenous peoples, these aren’t abstract negotiations. They are decisions that cut straight into our cultural, spiritual, and physical survival.

Our relationship with the moana is not something that can be measured in dollars or in tonnes of minerals. It’s woven into our identity, our stories, and our responsibilities. When people talk about the deep sea as a “resource” or a “frontier”, they ignore that, for us, this is part of our kinship network. The ocean is not a blank space to be carved up; it is part of who we are.

Deep sea mining threatens to extend and intensify the violence of colonization. We already live with the impacts: high rates of incarceration, mental illness, and systemic failures that fall hardest on our people. These are not isolated statistics – they are symptoms of a long history of land theft, cultural suppression, and decisions made about us without us.

Mining the deep sea risks layering yet another wound on top of those we’re still trying to heal. It pulls us further away from the healing and liberation we are working towards. When our relationship with the moana is damaged, it affects our wairua, our communities, and our ability to imagine a different future.

Being here, I feel guided by my tīpuna. Their presence reminds me that showing up in these international spaces is part of our responsibility. We don’t just come to make submissions or sit quietly in the back of the room. We come to stand in solidarity with other Indigenous and Pacific peoples, to be seen and heard, and to bring our whole selves – including our joy and our playfulness – into spaces that are often cold and technical.

Playful protest is one of our tools. It’s a way to disrupt the idea that these negotiations are neutral or purely bureaucratic. When we bring colour, song, and humour into these halls, we’re reminding everyone that what’s at stake is living communities, not just lines of legal text.

But presence alone is not enough if it’s not grounded in our own tikanga. When outsiders enter our spaces without proper protocols like karakia and karanga, they undermine our mana and intrude on our ways of relating to each other and to the world. These practices are not ceremonial add-ons; they are how we open and close space, how we keep each other safe, and how we acknowledge the seen and unseen.

We know that Papatūānuku has an incredible capacity to cleanse and restore. Our lands and oceans have healed from many harms when given the chance. But that capacity is not limitless. Deep sea mining threatens to push ecosystems, and our own communities, beyond what can be repaired in our lifetimes.

For Māori, our livelihoods and our identities are tied to the moana. When we talk about protecting the deep sea, we’re also talking about protecting our right to exist as Māori in a way that honours our ancestors and our descendants. That’s why being here, standing with Pacific activists and using every avenue we have to resist deep sea mining, is not just political work. It’s cultural work, spiritual work, and an expression of love for our people and our ocean.
