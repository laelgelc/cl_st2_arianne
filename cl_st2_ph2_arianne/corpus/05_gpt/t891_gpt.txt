For more than three decades at sea with Greenpeace, Peter Willcox has seen the front lines of environmental destruction up close: the polluters, the arrests, and the moments when standing up for the planet meant risking lives. One of those moments was the French bombing of the Rainbow Warrior in Auckland Harbour, an attack that sank the ship and killed his crewmate. That loss is part of what shaped his understanding of what it really means to protect our shared home.

Willcox often compares Earth to a boat. On a boat, everyone’s fate is linked: if someone starts drilling holes in the hull, it doesn’t matter where you’re standing—eventually the water reaches you too. With more than 7 billion people aboard this planetary vessel, we are, as he puts it, drilling holes: tearing down forests, poisoning water, destabilising the climate, and watching the waters rise. In that situation, the only honest message is an S.O.S.—Save Our Selves.

His drive to keep sending that S.O.S. comes from a deeply personal place: the future of his daughters. For him, the fight is not abstract. It’s about whether the next generation will inherit a world where they can live safely and with dignity, or one where environmental breakdown fuels ever more human suffering.

Willcox’s years with Greenpeace have shown him that environmental destruction is never just about landscapes or wildlife; it’s about people. On Rongelap Atoll, he witnessed the human toll of nuclear fallout. Residents there were living with the legacy of nuclear testing, their health and homes compromised by radiation. Evacuating the community was not just a symbolic gesture—it was a matter of survival, a direct response to the suffering caused by decisions made far from their shores.

He has seen the water rise and threaten communities who did nothing to cause the crisis. Rising seas are not a distant possibility but a lived reality for people whose homes, histories, and cultures are tied to vulnerable coastlines and islands. Their stories are warnings from the edges of a world under pressure.

In the Amazon, Willcox encountered another face of the crisis: people trapped in conditions of slavery linked to deforestation. The destruction of the forest is intertwined with the exploitation of workers, showing how the drive to extract and consume at any cost harms both the Earth and those with the least power to resist.

On a voyage involving Liberian stowaways, he saw how desperation pushes people into extreme risk. Their presence on board was a stark reminder that environmental and economic injustice often travel together, forcing people into dangerous journeys in search of a livable future.

In the Philippines, he met families living with the toxic legacy of US military waste. Pollution there was not an abstract contamination event but an everyday reality—poison in water, soil, and bodies. Among those affected was a young girl named Crizel, dying as a result of that poisoning. Her story, and the grief of her family, encapsulated what Willcox has learned again and again: behind every statistic about pollution or contamination are real people, often children, paying the price.

From nuclear fallout on Rongelap to rising seas, from slavery in the Amazon to toxic waste in the Philippines, the pattern is the same. Environmental destruction translates into human suffering—illness, displacement, exploitation, and loss. For Willcox, these experiences confirm why Greenpeace’s work matters: challenging polluters, confronting governments, and standing with communities are all part of one struggle to keep the boat afloat.

On this crowded planet-boat, we do not have the option to stand aside. The holes being drilled into our shared hull—by pollution, by militarism, by deforestation, by toxic dumping—threaten everyone aboard. The S.O.S. that Willcox talks about is not a call for rescue from somewhere else; it’s a call for us to act together, to Save Our Selves, before the rising waters reach us all.
