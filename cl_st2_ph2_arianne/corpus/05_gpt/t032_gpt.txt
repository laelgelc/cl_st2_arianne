At the 28th session of the International Seabed Authority (ISA), governments failed to agree on stopping deep sea mining, leaving the door open for destructive industrial exploitation of the ocean floor to begin as early as this year. This failure comes despite mounting global opposition and intensifying warnings from scientists, communities, and civil society.

The pressure on governments has been escalating since The Metals Company triggered the “2‑year rule” loophole to push for mining to start in July. This move attempted to force the ISA to rush through rules, or even allow mining to proceed without robust regulations in place. In response, Greenpeace took direct action against related expeditions at sea, challenging the industry’s attempts to fast-track one of the most harmful new extractive frontiers on the planet.

Indigenous Pacific activists have been at the forefront of resistance, raising the alarm about the risks deep sea mining poses to fragile ecosystems, vital food sources, and the wellbeing of coastal and island communities. They have firmly rejected what they describe as a new wave of neo-colonial exploitation in their waters, where powerful corporations and distant governments stand to profit while local people bear the environmental and social costs.

Protests have spread across the world, from the ISA’s headquarters in Kingston to the financial centre of Zurich, as people demand that governments protect the deep ocean rather than hand it over to mining companies. These mobilisations have coincided with growing scientific warnings about the irreversible damage deep sea mining could cause, and with a major corporate backer pulling its support from the industry.

Despite all this, the failure of governments at the 28th ISA Session to agree on a halt to deep sea mining means that the industry still has a path to start operations this year. With the July ISA meeting approaching, the responsibility now lies squarely with governments to act before it is too late. They must close the loopholes, heed Indigenous leadership and scientific evidence, and prevent deep sea mining from beginning in our oceans.
