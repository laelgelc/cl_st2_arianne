In Brasilia, the voices of over 5,000 Indigenous leaders from 120 different groups are rising together with a clear and urgent message: the destruction of the Amazon must stop, and the violence against those who protect it must end.

For ten days, these leaders are gathered at the 18th Free Land Camp, a powerful space of non-violent protest and collective resistance. Under the theme “Retaking Brazil: Demarcating Territories and Indigenize the Politics,” they are demanding immediate action on land demarcation and calling attention to fundamental rights such as health and education.

Their demands are rooted in lived reality. Indigenous Peoples are denouncing escalating threats to their territories and lives, including deforestation and the advance of mining. They are raising alarm over legislative proposals such as PL 191/2020 and the broader package known as #PacotedaDestruição, which they see as opening the door to further environmental devastation and violations of their rights.

Amid this context of pressure and violence, the numbers tell a stark story: murders and invasions of Indigenous territories are on the rise, as documented by the Indigenous Missionary Council (CIMI). These are not abstract statistics but lives cut short and communities under constant siege for defending the forest.

To confront this reality, the movement at the Free Land Camp has also taken its demands directly to the federal government. A petition with 517,000 signatures was delivered to the Ministry of Justice, symbolized by a totem pole adorned with ribbons. Each ribbon represents a voice calling for justice, protection of territories, and respect for Indigenous rights and knowledge.

The mobilization in Brasilia is a reminder that the future of the Amazon and the safety of its guardians are inseparable. Indigenous Peoples are making it clear: protecting their territories, ensuring their rights, and listening to their political demands are essential steps to defending the forest and all who depend on it.
