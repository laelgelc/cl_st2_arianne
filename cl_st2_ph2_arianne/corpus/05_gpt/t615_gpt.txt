From the frozen Arctic to the icy waters of Antarctica, Greenpeace is setting sail on an ambitious pole-to-pole expedition aboard the ship Esperanza. This journey will follow a path through some of the most unique and fragile ocean ecosystems on Earth, with one clear purpose: to expose the threats facing our oceans, confront environmental destruction, and champion real solutions.

The voyage begins in the Arctic, a region on the frontlines of the climate crisis. Here, Greenpeace will work alongside scientists to study how climate change is reshaping marine life. Shrinking sea ice is already transforming the Arctic landscape and putting species like polar bears at risk as their habitat and hunting grounds disappear. By gathering evidence at sea, the expedition will help show the human-driven changes unfolding in real time in one of the planet’s most important and vulnerable regions.

As the Esperanza travels south, the crew will document plastic pollution in the Sargasso Sea. This area, known for its clear blue waters and floating seaweed, is also becoming a symbol of how plastic waste is infiltrating even the most remote parts of our oceans. Recording the scale and impact of this pollution will help expose how single-use plastics and poor waste management are leaving a lasting mark on marine ecosystems and wildlife.

Further along the route, the expedition will investigate illegal fishing in the South Atlantic. Unsustainable and unlawful fishing practices are devastating fish populations and threatening the livelihoods of coastal communities that depend on healthy oceans. By shining a light on these activities, Greenpeace aims to hold those responsible to account and push for stronger protections and enforcement at sea.

Deep beneath the waves, another emerging threat looms: deep-sea mining. The Esperanza’s journey will also take it to the area known as the Lost City, a remarkable deep-sea ecosystem that could be at risk from mining operations. This fragile environment, largely unexplored and poorly understood, faces potential damage from industrial activity before its secrets are even fully known. Documenting the risks to places like the Lost City will help show why deep-sea mining must not be allowed to proceed unchecked.

Throughout the expedition, Greenpeace will highlight the incredible diversity of ocean life and habitats encountered along the way. From polar wildlife to deep-sea ecosystems, each stop on the journey will help tell the story of how interconnected and essential our oceans are—and how urgently they need protection.

This pole-to-pole voyage is part of the broader #ProtectTheOceans campaign, which is calling for a strong Global Ocean Treaty. The goal is clear: to secure protection for at least a third of the world’s oceans by 2030. By gathering evidence from across the seas and exposing the threats they face, the Esperanza’s journey aims to build the case for bold, binding global action to safeguard the oceans that sustain life on Earth.
