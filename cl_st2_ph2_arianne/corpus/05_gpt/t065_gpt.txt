Across the world, young people are using their voices and platforms to demand climate justice, challenge powerful interests, and reimagine what a fair and sustainable future could look like. Social media has become one of their most important tools: a way to share lived experiences, connect struggles across borders, and mobilise thousands—sometimes millions—into action.

This blog post introduces nine such activists, each using digital platforms in powerful and personal ways to raise awareness about the climate crisis and inspire others to get involved.

From Uganda, Edwin Namakanga shares first-hand experiences of how the climate crisis is already reshaping daily life. Inspired by the impacts he sees around him and by trailblazing activists such as Vanessa Nakate, he uses social media to highlight the realities faced by communities on the frontlines. His posts call attention to both the urgency of the crisis and the leadership emerging from African youth, who are too often sidelined in global conversations despite bearing the brunt of climate impacts.

In Germany, Fabian Grischkat brings together climate advocacy and LGBTQ+ rights, using his platforms to show how these struggles are connected. By speaking openly about identity, justice and the need for systemic change, he challenges followers to see climate action not as a single-issue fight, but as part of a broader push for dignity, equality and human rights. His content underscores that a safe climate future must be inclusive and affirming for everyone.

From Japan, Lillian Ono uses her online presence to connect the dots between the climate crisis and wider systems of injustice. She highlights how environmental breakdown intersects with issues such as inequality and discrimination, and uses social media to amplify the idea that climate action must tackle root causes, not just symptoms. By framing climate as a justice issue, she encourages her audience to think critically about power, responsibility and solidarity.

Also from Uganda, Rose Kobusinge focuses on centring African voices and promoting sustainable energy solutions. Through her posts, she challenges narratives that portray Africa only as a victim of the climate crisis, instead highlighting local leadership, innovation and resilience. She uses her platforms to advocate for clean, accessible energy that can power development without deepening the climate emergency, and to insist that African perspectives belong at the heart of global climate debates.

Straddling Hong Kong and the UK, Tori Tsui uses social media to explore the intersection of mental health and the climate crisis. She speaks openly about eco-anxiety, grief and the emotional toll of living in a warming world, helping others to feel less alone in their fears. By linking psychological wellbeing to activism, she encourages people to care for themselves and each other while continuing to push for systemic change, reminding followers that emotional honesty and political engagement can—and must—coexist.

In the UK, Venetia La Manna directs her online activism at the fast fashion industry. She uses her platforms to question the true cost of cheap clothing, spotlighting the exploitation of workers and the environmental destruction hidden behind glossy marketing. By calling out brands and promoting more responsible choices, she pushes her audience to think critically about consumption and to see fashion as a key battleground in the fight for climate justice.

From Brazil, Amanda Costa connects climate justice with racial justice. Her social media presence highlights how Black and marginalised communities are disproportionately affected by pollution, extreme weather and environmental degradation. By foregrounding these realities, she challenges followers to recognise that climate policies must confront structural racism and inequality, not just reduce emissions. Her work shows that a truly just transition must uplift those who have been historically excluded and harmed.

In Pakistan, Ayisha Siddiqa uses her voice and platforms to confront major polluters and stand up for marginalised communities. She calls out the companies and systems driving the climate crisis, while amplifying the stories of those whose lives and livelihoods are already being devastated. Her activism on social media is rooted in a demand for accountability and in the conviction that those who have contributed least to the crisis should not be the ones paying the highest price.

From France, Camille Etienne focuses her online advocacy on opposing destructive projects such as pipelines and mining. She uses digital platforms to raise awareness, mobilise support and put pressure on decision-makers, emphasising the urgency of stopping new fossil fuel infrastructure and extractive projects that lock in emissions and harm communities. Her work shows how targeted, strategic online campaigning can support on-the-ground resistance and influence public debate.

Across continents and contexts, these nine activists are using social media to make the climate crisis impossible to ignore and to insist that another world is possible. Their work demonstrates that online spaces can be powerful arenas for organising, storytelling and solidarity—especially when used to uplift frontline communities, expose injustice and invite others into collective action.

By following their journeys, sharing their messages and supporting their campaigns, people everywhere can tap into a global movement that is creative, intersectional and determined to transform the systems driving the climate emergency.
