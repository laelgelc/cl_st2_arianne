When I left Senegal for New York, I carried with me the hopes of millions of people back home and across the African continent. I was traveling to the UN negotiations at IGC5 on a global oceans treaty, a moment many of us believed could finally deliver a historic agreement: protecting at least 30% of the world’s oceans by 2030.

For communities in Senegal, the ocean is not an abstract concept or a distant horizon. It is daily life. Fish account for about 70% of the animal protein in our diet. The sea feeds our families, sustains our coastal communities, and supports countless livelihoods. When the ocean suffers, we feel it immediately in our plates, our markets, and our homes.

That is why this treaty matters so deeply to us. It is not just about numbers, percentages, or legal language. It is about whether vulnerable communities will still be able to rely on the ocean in the years to come.

In New York, after days of intense work and long hours, negotiations were suspended without a resolution. The talks ended without the global oceans treaty we so urgently need. Standing in that conference venue, with the process on hold, I felt the weight of what was at stake.

I had the opportunity to address the delegates on behalf of more than five million people around the world who are calling for strong ocean protection. I reminded them that for countries like mine, this is about survival and dignity. I urged them to protect the oceans not only for biodiversity, but for the communities whose lives are intertwined with the sea.

There had been progress in the room. We could feel momentum building. Some key issues were moving forward. And yet, in the end, the negotiations collapsed without an agreement, despite that sense that we were closer than ever.

This failure does not happen in a vacuum. It comes after around 20 years of discussions while the situation in the oceans has become more and more urgent. During those two decades, we have seen species pushed closer to extinction, more frequent and intense marine heatwaves, and the loss of around 70% of shark populations. All of this has unfolded while governments have talked, delayed, and postponed decisions.

We cannot afford to lose more time. Every year without a strong global oceans treaty is another year of mounting damage to ecosystems and additional pressure on the communities who depend on them most.

My message leaving New York is simple: the talks must resume as soon as possible, and governments must finalize this treaty this year. The world’s oceans, and the people who rely on them, cannot wait any longer.
