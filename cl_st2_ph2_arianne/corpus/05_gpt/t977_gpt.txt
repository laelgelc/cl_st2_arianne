Everyday wood products can carry a hidden cost far beyond their price tag: the destruction of ancient forests and the violation of human rights. Greenpeace has exposed how wood surfaces that end up in homes, offices, and public spaces in Europe may have their origins in illegal logging deep in the Congo Basin forests of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).

In the Congo Basin, illegal practices are widespread and devastating. These forests are among the most important on Earth, supporting biodiversity, regulating the climate, and sustaining local communities. Yet companies continue to profit from logging operations that destroy these environments and undermine the livelihoods of the people who depend on them.

Greenpeace traced a shipment of Wengé wood, a valuable and endangered tropical species, from its illegal felling by the company Bakri Bois Corporation in the DRC. From there, the timber was transported along the Congo River, one of the region’s main export routes, before being shipped to the European port of Antwerp.

Once in Antwerp, the wood was sold to the trading company Bois d’Afrique Mondiale. It was then sent on to a processing facility in the Czech Republic operated by the Danzer Group. This facility had recently been disassociated from the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) following human rights violations, raising serious concerns about the credibility of its sourcing and operations.

This case exposes serious weaknesses in the implementation of the European Union Timber Regulation (EUTR), which has been in force since 2013. The law is clear: timber placed on the EU market must not come from illegal sources. Yet, as this shipment shows, illegal wood can still move through supply chains and enter the EU market, despite the regulation.

Greenpeace is calling for authorities to fully enforce the EU Timber Regulation. That means conducting thorough investigations into suspicious timber flows, seizing illegal shipments, and holding companies accountable when they place illegal timber on the market. Without strong enforcement, the law remains a paper promise, and forests and communities in places like the Congo Basin continue to pay the price.

By exposing this Wengé wood trail—from illegal felling in the DRC to processing in Europe—Greenpeace is urging governments, companies, and consumers to confront the reality behind many wood products. Protecting the Congo Basin’s forests and the people who rely on them requires closing the loopholes that still allow illegal timber to slip into everyday life.
