On 29 May, a diesel oil tank at the Nadezhda plant on Russia’s Taymyr peninsula burst, spilling more than 20,000 tonnes of fuel into local waterways. The spill contaminated around 20 kilometres of rivers and streams, turning the Ambarnaya River red as it flowed toward the sea. The plant is operated by a division of Nornickel in the heavily polluted industrial city of Norilsk in the Russian Arctic.

The scale of the disaster only became widely known after media reports, rather than through timely disclosure by the company. This delay triggered public outrage and drew the attention of President Vladimir Putin, who reacted angrily and declared a federal state of emergency in response to the spill.

Greenpeace has estimated that the environmental damage from this single incident exceeds 10 billion roubles. At the same time, it notes that companies involved in such disasters often manage to evade full liability. According to Greenpeace, many corporations are also using the Covid pandemic as an opportunity to push for weaker environmental regulations instead of improving safety and accountability.

This disaster starkly illustrates the risks of fossil fuel production and storage in the fragile Arctic environment. Greenpeace is calling for the Russian government to conduct comprehensive audits of similar facilities and to introduce much more frequent inspections to prevent future accidents. Beyond emergency measures, Greenpeace is urging a broader shift: a green recovery package that supports a just transition away from oil and other fossil fuels, protecting both people and ecosystems in the Arctic and beyond.
