The Congo Basin, home to the world’s second-largest tropical rainforest, is at a critical moment. This vast forest plays a central role in stabilising the global climate by storing enormous amounts of carbon. When its trees are cut down or degraded, that stored carbon is released into the atmosphere, driving further climate breakdown.

New research suggests that deforestation rates in the region may be slowing. Yet, on the ground, evidence points to mounting threats. In the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), projections indicate the potential loss of 2.435 million hectares of intact primary forest over the next decade, largely driven by agricultural expansion and logging. These intact landscapes are some of the planet’s most important carbon sinks, making their protection essential for climate stability.

Forest loss in the Congo Basin is not only about clear-cutting. Degradation – the gradual thinning and damaging of forests through activities like selective logging and road-building – accelerates overall forest loss. Even when forests are not completely cleared, degradation weakens their ability to store carbon, support biodiversity, and sustain local communities.

Despite the signs of slowing deforestation, the pressure on the Congo Basin is intensifying. Oil palm plantations are among the growing threats, pushing deeper into forested areas and putting intact primary forests at risk. As these plantations expand, they can open the door to more logging, more roads, and more forest destruction.

In response, Greenpeace is calling for a clear shift in how the Congo Basin’s forests are treated. This means halting illegal logging, strengthening protection for remaining intact forests, and supporting responsible community use that prioritises long-term forest health over short-term profit. Protecting these forests is not only about safeguarding wildlife and local livelihoods; it is also about defending one of the world’s most important natural defences against climate chaos.
