Our current economic system is driving us deeper into crisis. It is built on inequality, overconsumption, and the dangerous myth that infinite growth is possible on a finite planet. This model depends on extracting more and more from nature, no matter the social or ecological cost, and it is fuelling climate breakdown and biodiversity loss.

Instead of using public money to accelerate a just transition, many governments are still pouring billions into propping up coal, oil, and gas. These fossil fuel subsidies artificially lower the price of the most polluting energy sources, locking us into an outdated and destructive system. Redirecting this money could rapidly scale up renewable energy and energy efficiency, while supporting communities and workers through the transition. Ending these subsidies is not a marginal tweak: removing them could cut global emissions by up to 10% by 2030.

This moment demands more than minor adjustments around the edges of a failing model. It calls for a radical transformation of the economic system itself. That means reimagining an economy that operates within planetary boundaries and is grounded in equity, care, and sufficiency rather than endless extraction and profit maximisation.

Public investment has a crucial role to play in this transformation. Instead of funding pollution, governments can channel resources into sustainable infrastructure, resilient and fair food systems, renewable energy, and accessible, low-carbon mobility. These choices can create decent jobs, reduce inequality, and restore ecosystems, while cutting emissions at the speed and scale required.

Transforming the system also requires a shift in values. An economy that truly serves people and nature must prioritise collective wellbeing, solidarity, and harmony with the living world. It means centring communities, especially those most affected by environmental and social injustice, in decisions about how resources are used and how the benefits are shared.

This change will not come from the top down alone. It depends on our ability to imagine and articulate alternatives together. By collectively envisioning different ways of organising our societies and economies, we can build the power and solidarity needed to move beyond a system that treats both people and the planet as expendable.

The crises we face are interconnected, and so are the solutions. By ending fossil fuel subsidies, investing in sustainable systems, and reorienting our economies around justice and ecological limits, we can move towards a future where both people and nature can thrive.
