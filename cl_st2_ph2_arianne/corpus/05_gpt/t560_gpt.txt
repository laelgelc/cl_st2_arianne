From the air, the Siberian taiga looks endless. A green sea of conifers stretches to the horizon—until, suddenly, it doesn’t. The trees give way to blackened ground and skeletal trunks, a vast charred landscape smothered in thick smoke. What used to be forest is now a patchwork of flame, ash, and haze.

Below, massive fires are burning across Siberia, together covering an area larger than Belgium. Yet only about 9% of these fires are being actively fought. Russian authorities have decided that tackling the rest is too costly and logistically difficult, leaving huge swathes of forest to burn on their own.

On the ground, the conditions are primed for disaster. Hot, dry weather is fueling new outbreaks every day. Villages sit in the path of advancing flames, and wildlife has little chance to escape. Sables, bears, deer, and elk are among the animals whose habitats are being destroyed, their forest homes turned into smoking ruins.

From the helicopter, it’s possible to trace how human activity feeds this catastrophe. Around logging sites and along roads, scars in the forest align with many of the ignition points. Around 90% of the fires are human-caused, flaring up where people work, travel, and alter the land. Once started, the fires are driven further and faster by the same climate change they help worsen, as rising temperatures and prolonged dry spells make the taiga ever more vulnerable to burning.

Firefighters on the front lines are doing what they can—digging firebreaks, dousing hotspots, working long hours in dangerous conditions. But in many places, the blazes are simply beyond human control. The scale is too vast, the weather too favorable to fire, the resources too limited.

The smoke doesn’t respect distance. It drifts far beyond the burning forests, spreading to distant cities and towns. People hundreds of kilometers away wake to hazy skies and the smell of burning wood, breathing in the distant disaster as it unfolds.

What is happening in Siberia is not a series of isolated incidents. It is a vast, interconnected crisis: human-caused fires, intensified by a warming climate, destroying forests, displacing wildlife, threatening communities, and sending their smoke and emissions far beyond the fire lines. From above, it’s clear how quickly a living forest can turn into a dead, smoking expanse—and how small human efforts look against the scale of what is burning.
