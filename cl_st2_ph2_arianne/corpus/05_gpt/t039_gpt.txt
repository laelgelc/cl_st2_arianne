The latest findings from the IPCC’s Sixth Assessment Report make clear that human-caused climate change is already intensifying weather extremes across the globe. From more frequent and severe heatwaves to heavier rainfall and longer, more intense droughts, these impacts are being felt in every region. Ecosystems are under mounting pressure, and communities that are already vulnerable are suffering the most—despite having contributed the least to the crisis.

The report shows that risks are escalating at lower levels of warming than previously understood. What was once considered “safe” is now recognised as far more dangerous. On our current trajectory, the world is heading toward around 3°C of warming by 2100. This path threatens irreversible losses, including the potential for large-scale ice sheet melt and the extinction of countless species. These are changes that cannot simply be undone, with consequences that will echo for generations.

Yet the IPCC is equally clear that this future is not inevitable. Limiting global warming to 1.5°C is still possible, but only if urgent and far-reaching action is taken this decade. That means halving global greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. It means a rapid phase-out of fossil fuels, replacing coal, oil, and gas with clean, renewable energy sources. It also requires large-scale restoration and protection of ecosystems, which can absorb carbon and help shield communities from climate impacts.

Finance must be equitable, ensuring that resources flow to those who need them most to adapt, recover, and pursue low-carbon development pathways. Transformative, inclusive changes are needed across all sectors—energy, transport, industry, agriculture, and cities. According to the IPCC’s assessment, only through such comprehensive and just transitions can we secure a sustainable future and reduce the worst risks of climate breakdown.
