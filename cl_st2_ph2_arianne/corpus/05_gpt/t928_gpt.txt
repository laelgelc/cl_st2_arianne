Forests are vital allies in the fight against climate change, absorbing CO2 and releasing oxygen. Yet they are under severe threat. Between 1990 and 2005, the world lost 14.5 million hectares of forest every year – an area equivalent to one football pitch disappearing every two seconds. This loss is not just about trees being cut down entirely; forests are also being degraded and fragmented, weakening their ability to support biodiversity, regulate climate, and sustain local communities.

A major driver of this destruction is agriculture. Products such as palm oil and soy are linked to around 80% of global deforestation. These commodities often enter consumer markets through complex international supply chains, making it essential that importing regions take responsibility for the impacts of what they buy and sell.

The European Union has taken steps to tackle illegal logging and trade in illegal timber through its Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade (FLEGT) Action Plan and related measures. Since 2009, the EU has also been working with China to address illegal timber flows. However, China’s ongoing apathy towards strong action on illegal timber undermines these efforts and weakens global attempts to protect forests.

Within the EU itself, implementation of existing rules is uneven. Some countries, such as Spain, have not yet fully enforced the measures designed to keep illegal timber off the market. There are also concerns that FLEGT licenses and agreements could be approved prematurely, before robust safeguards and enforcement systems are truly in place. This risks giving a false sense of progress while illegal logging and forest destruction continue.

The EU must therefore fully implement its FLEGT measures and use its political and economic weight to influence China and other major players to act decisively against illegal timber. At the same time, the EU needs to confront the broader role of its imports in driving deforestation beyond timber alone. Palm oil, soy and other agricultural commodities linked to forest loss must be addressed if the EU is to reduce its true deforestation footprint.

In 2013, the European Commission formally recognized the scale and urgency of the problem. It is now considering new policies aimed at achieving zero-deforestation supply chains by 2020. These potential measures include supporting better forest governance in producer countries, upholding the rights of indigenous peoples and local communities, and increasing funding for forest protection.

Ensuring that these commitments translate into real change will require closing enforcement gaps within the EU, avoiding rushed approvals that weaken FLEGT, and tackling all major deforestation-linked imports. Only then can forests continue to play their crucial role in stabilizing the climate and sustaining life on Earth.
