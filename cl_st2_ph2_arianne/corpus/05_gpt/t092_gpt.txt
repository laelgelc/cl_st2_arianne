After days of tense, overtime negotiations, governments at COP27 finally agreed to establish a Loss and Damage fund to support communities already being hit hardest by the climate crisis. This was a hard-won outcome for many climate-vulnerable countries and communities that have long demanded support for the devastating impacts they did not cause. It stands out as a crucial step forward in an otherwise deeply compromised outcome.

Beyond this breakthrough, COP27 fell far short of what is needed to keep global heating within 1.5°C. Despite strong calls from many countries, governments failed to agree on a phase-out of fossil fuels. This leaves coal, oil, and gas corporations largely unchecked and ramps up the pressure on COP28 to finally confront the root cause of the crisis.

COP27 was billed as both an “implementation COP” and an “Africa COP,” raising expectations that it would deliver stronger national climate plans and concrete progress for people on the frontlines. Instead, it delivered little on strengthened commitments to limit warming to 1.5°C, risking a retreat from the ambition agreed in Paris. The gap between what science demands and what governments are currently willing to do remains dangerously wide.

Urgent action is still needed to cut emissions rapidly and fairly, and to ensure that those most responsible for the crisis pay for the solutions. Polluters must fund adaptation to escalating impacts, deep and sustained emissions cuts, and a just transition away from fossil fuels that protects workers and communities. With COP28 in the UAE on the horizon, people power will be essential to push governments and corporations to move from words to real action that protects people and the planet.
