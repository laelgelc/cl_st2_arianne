In the arid landscapes of Egypt’s Sinai region, the community around St. Catherine faces mounting pressure from tourism development and the accelerating impacts of climate change. This area, recognized as a UNESCO site, is not only ecologically fragile but also home to a rich cultural heritage that risks being eroded as modern pressures intensify.

In 2017, Dina Kafafi founded Sinaweya as a social enterprise to help safeguard this unique place. Rooted in St. Catherine, Sinaweya’s work centers on preserving both the ecological integrity of the region and the cultural traditions that have allowed people to live in balance with their environment for generations.

A cornerstone of the project is its close collaboration with the Bedouin Jabaliya tribe, whose ancestral knowledge is central to the initiative. For centuries, the Jabaliya have cultivated expertise in horticulture, herbalism, and crafts, developing ways of living that are deeply adapted to the harsh desert conditions. Sinaweya recognizes this knowledge as a vital resource, not a relic, and works to bring it to the forefront of local development.

One of the key efforts is the rehabilitation of traditional gardens. These gardens are more than plots of land; they are living archives of seeds, plants, and techniques that have sustained the community over time. By restoring and caring for them, Sinaweya and local gardeners are reviving traditional horticultural practices that support food security, biodiversity, and resilience in the face of a changing climate.

Alongside this, Sinaweya is building a herbal database that documents local plants and their uses. This initiative helps protect the community’s herbal knowledge from being lost and creates a foundation for future generations to learn from and build upon. It also underscores the value of local ecosystems, highlighting the importance of conserving the plants that have long provided medicine, nutrition, and income.

Economic empowerment is woven through all of this work. Through the be.do brand, Sinaweya helps transform local skills and resources into sustainable livelihood opportunities. Traditional crafts, such as the embroidery practiced by local women, are given new visibility and market access, allowing artisans to earn an income while keeping their cultural expressions alive. At the same time, young gardeners are engaged in the rehabilitation and care of gardens, gaining practical skills and a sense of ownership over their land and traditions.

This approach strengthens self-sufficiency by grounding economic activity in practices that care for the environment rather than deplete it. By centering the knowledge and leadership of the Jabaliya community, Sinaweya creates pathways for people to stay on their land, maintain their cultural identity, and adapt to new challenges without abandoning what makes their home unique.

In St. Catherine, the work of Sinaweya shows how ecological preservation and cultural continuity can reinforce one another. As tourism and climate change reshape the Sinai, this community-based effort offers a way forward that respects the past while creating tangible opportunities in the present—supporting livelihoods, restoring landscapes, and keeping ancestral knowledge alive.
