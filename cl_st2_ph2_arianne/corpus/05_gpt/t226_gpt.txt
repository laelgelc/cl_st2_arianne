From coastal villages to megacities, a new generation of Greenpeace volunteers across Asia is stepping up for climate justice, each shaped by the crises unfolding around them and united by a shared determination to protect their communities.

In the Philippines, Ronan’s journey into activism began in the aftermath of Typhoon Haiyan, one of the most devastating storms to hit the country. Witnessing the destruction and loss, he turned to advocacy that connects personal stories with policy change. For Ronan, storytelling is not just about remembering what happened; it’s about making sure decision-makers cannot look away from the human reality of the climate crisis. His work bridges the gap between lived experience and the laws and policies needed to protect people on the frontlines.

In Malaysia, Hui Ling helped lay the foundations for Greenpeace’s presence by founding the local office. She now leads campaigns against pollution and deforestation, confronting the industries and practices that are degrading forests and poisoning air and water. Her activism is rooted in the belief that people deserve to live in healthy environments, and that communities can push back against destructive projects when they are organized and informed.

In Indonesia, Tya faces climate impacts in the most direct way possible: as a volunteer firefighter battling forest fires. On the ground, she confronts smoke, flames, and the toll that recurring fires take on people’s health, livelihoods, and ecosystems. Her work shows how climate activism can mean both challenging the drivers of environmental harm and stepping in to protect communities when disasters strike.

In Thailand, Amika focuses on the growing plastic waste crisis and its links to climate change. She works to reduce plastic pollution and address the broader climate impacts that threaten communities and ecosystems. By tackling waste and climate together, Amika highlights how everyday consumption and global warming are intertwined, and how solutions must address both.

In South Korea, severe floods pushed Minseop to act. He now uses design to support climate policy change, creating visuals that make complex issues understandable and urgent. His work helps translate scientific and policy language into images that resonate with the public and decision-makers, turning data into a compelling call for action.

In India, Neha promotes practical, community-based solutions like composting and clean air initiatives. By encouraging composting, she supports ways of living that reduce waste and restore soils. Through clean air work, she confronts one of the most immediate and visible impacts of environmental degradation on people’s health. Her efforts show how climate and environmental action can start at home and spread through neighborhoods and cities.

Across these stories, a shared thread emerges: resilience in the face of disaster, a commitment to direct action, and a deep belief in the power of community. Whether through policy advocacy, creative communication, firefighting, local campaigns, or everyday solutions, these Greenpeace volunteers from Asia are demonstrating that climate justice is built by people who refuse to accept that destruction is inevitable.

Their experiences remind us that environmental protection is not an abstract ideal. It is the work of people standing up for their homes, their loved ones, and their future—together.
