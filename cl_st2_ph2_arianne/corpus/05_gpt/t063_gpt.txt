Once again, the World Economic Forum has gathered in Davos under the banner of “fixing” the world’s biggest crises—inequality, climate breakdown, environmental exploitation. Yet the mountain resort is crowded with private jets, helicopters and luxury convoys, a stark reminder that those most responsible for the problem still insist on arriving in the most polluting way possible. The message is clear: the world’s elite want to talk about climate solutions while maintaining lifestyles that fuel climate chaos.

This hypocrisy runs deeper than individual choices. Davos is built on the premise that the same profit-driven system that caused these overlapping crises can somehow solve them. Corporate leaders, financiers and politicians meet to discuss “inclusive growth” and “green transitions,” but the underlying model remains untouched: a capitalism that concentrates wealth, extracts from nature and communities, and treats both as resources to be exploited rather than relationships to be cared for.

Oxfam’s latest analysis exposes just how extreme this concentration has become. Since 2020, the richest 1% have captured most of the new wealth created globally. While billions of people face rising living costs, precarious work and the escalating impacts of climate breakdown, a tiny elite continues to amass fortunes at unprecedented speed. This is not an accident or a glitch in the system—it is how the system is designed to work.

In this context, calls for modest reforms or voluntary corporate pledges ring hollow. Oxfam’s demand for wealth taxes is a clear, concrete step toward rebalancing power and resources. Taxing the richest individuals and corporations is not about punishment—it is about justice. The revenues could support climate action, public services, social protection and community-led solutions, especially in countries that have been pushed into debt and dependency by a global economic order they did not design.

Debt cancellation is central to this shift. Many countries in the Global South are trapped in a cycle where servicing external debt takes precedence over investing in climate resilience, health, education and renewable energy. Canceling unjust debts would free up resources for communities to respond to the climate crisis on their own terms, instead of being forced to choose between austerity and survival.

The Davos model also sidelines alternative ways of organizing our economies and societies. Indigenous peoples and frontline communities have long practiced forms of stewardship that prioritize balance, reciprocity and collective well-being over short-term profit. Community-focused models—cooperatives, commons-based governance, local energy systems, solidarity economies—are already delivering real benefits in the Global South. They show that it is possible to live well without treating the planet as a mine and people as disposable.

Yet those who bear the brunt of climate impacts and economic injustice are largely excluded from the Davos conversation. Decisions are made in their name, without their presence. This exclusion doesn’t just undermine the legitimacy of the WEF—it undermines its ability to find real solutions. You cannot solve inequality by centering the voices of the already-powerful, and you cannot design fair climate policies while sidelining those who are losing homes, lands and livelihoods.

A different path is both necessary and possible. It means shifting from an obsession with GDP growth to a focus on well-being: clean air and water, secure livelihoods, healthy ecosystems, strong public services and democratic participation. It means taxing extreme wealth and corporate profits to fund a just transition. It means canceling debts that lock countries into fossil-fuel dependence and austerity. And it means embracing multilateral cooperation grounded in justice, not in the narrow interests of the richest countries and corporations.

Community innovations across the Global South are already pointing the way—through local food systems, renewable energy projects, Indigenous land governance and grassroots climate adaptation. These efforts prove that solutions do not need to come from elite boardrooms; they are being built, tested and refined by the very people most affected by crisis.

As long as Davos clings to private jets, profit-first thinking and exclusive spaces, it will remain part of the problem, not the solution. Real transformation will come from centering Indigenous knowledge, community power and justice-based cooperation—not from hoping that those at the top of a deeply unequal system will voluntarily dismantle the very structures that keep them there.
