In a few days, world leaders, negotiators and observers will gather in Poland for COP24, the next major UN climate conference. On the surface it might look like just another big meeting with long speeches, complicated agendas and endless acronyms. But what’s at stake is very simple: whether governments can agree the detailed “rulebook” for the Paris climate agreement – the plan that will guide how we protect our climate, oceans, forests and the wildlife that depends on them.

Think of it like a global Google document that every country is editing at the same time. The words that end up on the final page will shape how fast we cut emissions, how fairly we share responsibilities, how we support the most vulnerable, and how honestly we report what we’re doing. Every bracket and every line matters, because this is the manual for turning promises into real-world action.

My first UN climate meeting showed me just how messy that process can be. The rooms were full of people speaking in acronyms and technical language, talking in circles, and spending hours debating phrases that, from the outside, might look insignificant. It was frustrating to watch how slow it all seemed when we know climate impacts are already here.

But sitting in those rooms, another truth was impossible to ignore: countries from every corner of the world were there, trying to work together on a shared problem. Delegates who disagree on almost everything else were at the same tables, arguing over the details of how to protect our common home. And in the corridors and side meetings, civil society and NGOs like Greenpeace were there too – lobbying, pushing, reminding governments why this matters and who they are accountable to.

This isn’t an abstract diplomatic exercise. It affects all of us. Communities in developing countries, who have done the least to cause the climate crisis, are already facing some of the harshest impacts. For them, the outcome of COP24 will influence whether there is support to adapt, rebuild and protect lives and livelihoods. For people everywhere, it will influence how quickly we move away from fossil fuels and how seriously governments take their promises.

We’re already seeing climate disruption around the world, and that’s exactly why these negotiations can’t just drift into more vague statements and distant targets. We need clear, concrete action plans. The rulebook agreed in Poland has to make it obvious who must do what, by when, and how progress will be measured.

There is real reason to hold on to hope. A recent UN report has shown that there is still a window to act – to limit the worst impacts of climate change if we move fast enough and with enough ambition. That window is not wide, but it is still open. COP24 is one of the key moments where governments can decide to step through it.

Public pressure is essential. These talks shouldn’t just be a conversation between politicians behind closed doors. They need to hear from the people whose futures are on the line. One way to do that is by joining the global call for action online. Ahead of COP24, people around the world are being invited to send messages using the hashtag #TakeYourSeat. Those messages will help shape the address that David Attenborough delivers to world leaders at the conference.

If you care about the oceans, forests, animals and communities already feeling the effects of climate change, this is your chance to speak up. Add your voice, share your concerns, your demands and your hopes. The negotiators in Poland will be editing the rulebook for our shared future. Let’s make sure they know the world is watching – and expecting them to deliver.
