For 50 years, oil has shaped life in Scotland. It brought jobs, money and a sense of security to communities, especially in the north-east. Now, as the industry changes and declines, that sense of security is disappearing – and people are being left to pick up the pieces.

Workers are facing rising unemployment. Families who once relied on steady offshore wages are struggling to get by, and food bank usage is increasing. Communities that were built around oil are losing not just income, but a way of life.

Greenpeace UK digital campaigner Ravishaan Rahel Muthiah is working for a different path – a just transition to clean energy and secure green jobs. That means moving away from fossil fuels in a way that supports workers and communities, instead of abandoning them as the industry winds down.

To understand what this really looks like on the ground, Greenpeace spoke to people who know the industry from the inside.

Wullie described the realities of offshore work: long stretches away from home, tough conditions, and serious impacts on health. On top of that, he’s lived through waves of redundancies, watching colleagues and friends lose their livelihoods as the industry contracts.

Robbie highlighted another barrier: the cost of change. He wants to move into new, cleaner industries, but faces high training fees that make retraining difficult or impossible for many workers. The people who powered the economy for decades are being asked to pay out of their own pockets just to stay employed.

Yvonne focused on the role of government. She believes those in power must put the planet and people ahead of oil company profits. That means planning properly for the end of oil, investing in alternatives, and making sure workers aren’t the ones left carrying the burden of the climate crisis.

Alan offered a glimpse of what a better future could look like. He sees hope in renewable energy and believes there is a path where workers can move into new, greener jobs – if they’re given the right support, training and opportunities.

Together, these stories reveal common struggles: insecure work, financial pressure, health impacts and a lack of support during a time of huge change. They also show a shared understanding that workers in polluting industries should not be made to shoulder the costs of tackling climate change on their own.

That’s why Greenpeace UK, alongside Friends of the Earth Scotland and Platform, is campaigning for a supported transition – one that guarantees secure, well-paid green jobs and protects communities as the oil era comes to an end.
