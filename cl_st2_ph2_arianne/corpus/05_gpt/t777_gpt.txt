Samsung’s flashy launch of the S9 might look like the cutting edge of innovation, but behind the slick marketing, the company is lagging badly where it matters most: cleaning up its energy use.

While major tech rivals like Apple, Google and Facebook have already committed to 100% renewable energy and are making real progress, Samsung is stuck in the past. Despite its size and influence, Samsung currently uses only 1% renewable energy. That’s a staggering failure of leadership for one of the world’s biggest electronics manufacturers.

This isn’t just a technical detail. Around 80% of the climate-warming emissions from our gadgets happen before we ever open the box. The vast majority of that comes from manufacturing, which is still heavily powered by coal and gas. Every new phone rolling off a fossil-fuelled production line locks in more pollution.

The scale of this problem is enormous. Smartphone production between 2007 and 2017 alone created emissions on the scale of Japan’s entire annual electricity consumption. Last year, 1.53 billion phones were sold worldwide, driving massive resource extraction and a growing mountain of electronic waste. Samsung, as a global market leader, sits right at the centre of this system.

What makes Samsung’s inaction even more indefensible is that people clearly want better. A 2015 study found that 66% of customers are willing to pay more for sustainable brands. In a Greenpeace survey, 85% of more than 8,000 supporters said they would be more likely to buy Samsung products if the company were leading on sustainability. The demand is there. Customers are ready. Samsung is the one dragging its feet.

Instead of using its technological prowess to accelerate a transition to clean energy, Samsung is clinging to a fossil-fuelled business model that undermines any claims of innovation. As long as its factories are powered by coal and gas, every new product launch comes with a hidden climate price tag.

This needs to change, and Samsung won’t move unless it feels pressure from the people it cares about most: its customers and fans. You can help push Samsung to do the right thing.

Go to Samsung’s Facebook page and post a comment calling on the company to commit to 100% renewable energy and clean up its supply chain. Tell Samsung that a truly “smart” phone shouldn’t come with a dirty energy footprint. Let them know that until they switch to renewables, they’re not leading the future – they’re holding it back.
