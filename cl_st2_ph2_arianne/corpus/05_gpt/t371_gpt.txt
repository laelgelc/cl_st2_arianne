In a year defined by lockdowns, isolation, and a global health crisis, people everywhere were told to stay home, keep quiet, and wait it out. Yet across continents and oceans, Greenpeace activists refused to let 2020 become a lost year for the climate.

In San Francisco, activists took to the water, sailing out to send a clear message: public money should not be used to bail out the oil industry. While governments rushed to support polluting corporations, these activists insisted that recovery funds must fuel a just, green transition instead of propping up an industry driving the climate crisis.

In the Philippines, people mobilised to call out their government’s failures. Even as communities faced the twin threats of the pandemic and climate impacts, activists found ways to make their anger and demands visible, refusing to accept inaction and neglect.

In Berlin, where streets and squares fell quiet, the climate movement went digital—but not invisible. Activists used light painting to bring digital climate strikes to life in public spaces, turning darkness into a canvas for demands for climate justice, and proving that creativity could overcome physical distance.

Off the coast of the UK, activists directly confronted the fossil fuel industry by blocking a BP rig. As the world learned hard lessons about vulnerability and resilience, this action underscored the urgent need to leave fossil fuels behind and keep oil and gas in the ground.

In Seoul, youth voices were amplified through powerful projections. Instead of being sidelined, young people’s demands for a livable future were literally cast into the public eye, a reminder that the next generation is watching—and taking action.

In Germany, the demolition of a nuclear plant became a moment of celebration. For years, communities and campaigners had pushed for an energy system free from risky, outdated technologies. Marking the end of this plant was also a call to accelerate the shift to safe, renewable energy.

In Hong Kong, a paraglider soared over contested waters to protest land reclamation. From the air, the message was unmissable: destructive projects that damage marine ecosystems and coastal communities are not a solution to urban or economic pressures.

In Jakarta, activists stood up for Indonesian migrant fishers, whose lives and rights are too often exploited and ignored. Linking labour justice with environmental protection, they highlighted how the same systems that abuse workers also plunder the oceans.

In Denmark, activists occupied an oil rig to demand bans on fossil fuels. This bold action in the heart of the industry showed that phasing out oil and gas is not a distant dream, but a necessary step that governments must take now.

Far to the north, in Norilsk, Russia—one of the most polluted places on Earth—banners were raised against toxic contamination and environmental destruction. Even in a city scarred by industrial pollution, people still found the courage to speak out and demand change.

Across all these places, 2020 was not only a year of crisis; it was a year of persistence. On boats and rigs, in cities and industrial zones, in the air and online, people kept pushing for climate justice. Their actions showed that even in the most difficult times, the movement for a safer, fairer, greener world does not stop.
