In July 2010, two of Greenpeace’s founding figures, Jim Bohlen, 84, and Dorothy Stowe, 89, passed away within days of each other. Their lives were intertwined not only as friends and collaborators, but as catalysts for a movement that would grow from a small group of concerned citizens into a global environmental organization. Remembering them is also a way of remembering how Greenpeace began: as an experiment in courage, community, and creative nonviolence.

Jim Bohlen’s journey toward pacifism began in the shadow of Hiroshima. The bombing, and the dawning nuclear age it symbolized, left a lasting mark on him. Over time, this experience shaped his deep commitment to nonviolence and his determination to challenge the escalating nuclear arms race. Seeking a different kind of life, he immigrated to Canada, where he found both a new home and a new context for his activism.

In Vancouver, Bohlen joined with others who shared his alarm at U.S. nuclear testing in Alaska’s Aleutian Islands. Together they formed the Don’t Make a Wave Committee, a small but determined group that blended moral conviction with strategic creativity. The committee’s name captured their immediate concern: stopping a planned U.S. nuclear test at Amchitka, an earthquake-prone island in the North Pacific. Their idea was both simple and bold—sail a boat into the test zone to bear witness and draw public attention to the danger. That first anti-nuclear voyage to Amchitka, launched under the banner of the Don’t Make a Wave Committee, became the seed from which Greenpeace would grow.

If Bohlen’s story speaks to the power of personal transformation, Dorothy Stowe’s life highlights the importance of organizing, care, and community-building in social change. Trained as a social worker, she brought to her activism a grounded understanding of people’s everyday struggles. She was also a union leader, experienced in collective action and in standing up for justice in workplaces and communities.

Stowe’s peace activism connected her to broader movements for disarmament and social justice. In Vancouver, she became one of the central figures who helped knit together the diverse people who would launch Greenpeace. She was known for building coalitions—bringing together individuals and groups who might otherwise never have found common cause. Her home became a hub of activity, as she hosted meetings where strategy, ethics, and logistics were debated around kitchen tables. These gatherings were crucial to the early development of the organization, providing both a physical space and a sense of shared purpose that sustained the fledgling movement.

The Vancouver that nurtured Greenpeace’s birth was itself a kind of hybrid. It attracted immigrants from the United States, many of them disillusioned by war and politics south of the border, and it brought together people of different generations who were searching for new ways to make change. This mix of backgrounds and ages helped shape Greenpeace’s character from the start: a blend of youthful idealism and seasoned experience, of radical imagination and practical organizing.

Media strategy was also part of this hybrid culture. From the beginning, the founders understood that images and stories could shift public opinion and pressure governments. The plan to sail to Amchitka was not only an act of moral defiance; it was a way to capture the world’s attention and make distant nuclear tests impossible to ignore. This approach—bearing witness directly and making sure the world could see—became a hallmark of Greenpeace’s work.

At the heart of these early efforts were core founding couples like Jim Bohlen and his partner, and Dorothy Stowe and her partner—people whose personal relationships were inseparable from their political commitments. They shared homes, resources, and responsibilities; they raised families while organizing campaigns; they turned their private lives into bases for public action. Their partnerships embodied the idea that social change begins in the everyday choices people make about how to live, work, and care for one another.

Commemorating the lives of Jim Bohlen and Dorothy Stowe is more than an act of remembrance. It is an opportunity to recognize how much of Greenpeace’s strength came from ordinary people who refused to accept the inevitability of war and environmental destruction. Their legacies live on not only in the organization they helped to found, but in every act of peaceful resistance that challenges the powerful and defends the planet.

In July 2010, the world lost two remarkable agents of social change. Yet the spirit that guided Bohlen from Hiroshima’s shadow to the deck of a protest vessel, and that led Stowe from social work and union halls to a kitchen table crowded with activists, continues to guide Greenpeace’s work today. Their lives remind us that movements are built by people who open their homes, cross borders, form unlikely alliances, and dare to say no—loudly, publicly, and together—when the future is at risk.
