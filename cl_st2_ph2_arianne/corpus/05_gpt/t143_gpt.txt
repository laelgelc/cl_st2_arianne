Nature is collapsing around us. Forests are being razed at a terrifying rate, driving the intertwined crises of climate breakdown and biodiversity loss. As deforestation tears through some of the most precious ecosystems on Earth, entire webs of life are being pushed toward extinction. This destruction is not inevitable; it is the result of political choices, economic systems, and conservation models that too often ignore the people who are best placed to protect nature.

At the heart of the solution lies a truth that governments gathering at COP15 in Montreal must finally act on: protecting biodiversity means recognizing and upholding the rights of Indigenous Peoples. Indigenous territories are home to some of the world’s richest biodiversity, and evidence shows that when Indigenous communities are in charge, ecosystems are better protected. Their knowledge, governance systems, and deep relationships with their lands and waters consistently deliver more effective and enduring conservation outcomes than many conventional approaches.

Yet instead of being supported, Indigenous Peoples are frequently criminalized, displaced, and stripped of control over their territories. While they are defending forests and ecosystems, their lands are being carved up and taken over by destructive industries, from logging and mining to large-scale agribusiness. This double injustice—being both guardians of nature and targets of dispossession—must end.

One of the most harmful drivers of this injustice is the model often referred to as “fortress conservation.” Under this approach, conservation areas are created and enforced by excluding or expelling the very communities who live there. It treats local and Indigenous people as threats to nature rather than as its stewards. Fortress conservation has led to serious human rights abuses, including violence in places such as Tanzania and Central Africa, where communities have been beaten, harassed, or driven from their ancestral lands in the name of creating or maintaining protected areas. This exclusionary model is rooted in colonial thinking: it replicates the old logic of land grabs, where powerful actors decide who belongs and who does not, and who benefits and who pays the price.

This colonial mindset has no place in a just and effective response to the biodiversity crisis. Conservation cannot be built on dispossession. If COP15 is to be a turning point for nature, governments must reject fortress conservation and embrace an approach that centers justice, rights, and community leadership.

A crucial step is the formal recognition of Indigenous Peoples’ rights within global biodiversity agreements. This includes creating a new category of conservation specifically for Indigenous lands—one in which Indigenous Peoples themselves lead decision-making, set priorities, and have direct access to funding. Such a category would acknowledge that Indigenous territories are not empty spaces to be managed from afar, but living homelands where culture, identity, and ecosystems are inseparable.

Placing Indigenous Peoples in the lead also means shifting how conservation finance is designed and delivered. Funding must flow directly to Indigenous institutions and community organizations, not just to large conservation NGOs or state agencies that may continue exclusionary practices. With adequate resources, Indigenous communities can strengthen their own governance systems, defend their territories from industrial encroachment, and restore damaged ecosystems in ways that align with their values and knowledge.

There are signs of progress. In countries such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, steps are being taken that point toward a more just form of conservation and a greater recognition of Indigenous rights. These developments show that change is possible when governments listen to communities and begin to move away from top‑down, exclusionary models. But these examples remain the exception, not the rule. Around the world, fortress conservation still dominates too many policies, parks, and funding streams.

COP15 in Montreal is a critical moment to change course. Governments have the opportunity to commit to a new global framework for biodiversity that not only sets ambitious targets, but also transforms how those targets are pursued. That transformation must include:

- Explicit recognition of Indigenous Peoples as rights-holders, not stakeholders.
- A dedicated conservation category for Indigenous territories where they lead decisions and control funding.
- A clear rejection of conservation approaches that dispossess or criminalize communities.
- Increased investment in rights-based, community-led conservation as a central strategy for protecting biodiversity.

The collapse of nature cannot be halted with more of the same failed, colonial-era approaches. It demands courage from political leaders to confront entrenched interests and outdated models. It demands solidarity with Indigenous Peoples who are already protecting the forests, savannas, wetlands, and other ecosystems that all of us depend on.

As delegates meet in Montreal, the choice before them is stark. They can continue to endorse conservation that walls off nature and pushes people out, or they can help build a future where thriving ecosystems and thriving Indigenous communities go hand in hand. Protecting biodiversity is not just about drawing new lines on a map; it is about recognizing who has protected these places all along and ensuring they have the power and resources to continue doing so.

The world is watching COP15. To truly safeguard nature, governments must stand with Indigenous Peoples, reject fortress conservation, and invest in just, rights-based conservation that addresses both the ecological and human dimensions of this crisis.
