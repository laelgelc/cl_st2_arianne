The COVID-19 crisis has revealed how quickly our world can change, and how deeply those changes affect our health, our economies, and our daily lives. As societies grapple with the fallout, the choices made in the months and years ahead will shape not only how we recover from the pandemic, but also how we confront the climate emergency.

There is a real risk that, as restrictions ease, major polluters will seize the moment to ramp up emissions and push for a return to the old, destructive status quo. Short-term drops in pollution and greenhouse gas emissions during lockdowns have shown how dramatically human activity impacts the planet, but these reductions will be fleeting if they are followed by a surge in fossil fuel use, deregulation, and weakened environmental protections.

Instead of allowing a polluting “rebound,” the financial support being mobilized in response to the pandemic can and should be used to drive a just, green transition. Public money must serve the public interest. That means investing in quality, secure jobs that are compatible with a stable climate; strengthening public services that protect people’s health and wellbeing; and ensuring that support reaches those who are most vulnerable, not just those with the loudest corporate lobbies.

A recovery that doubles down on fossil fuels and inequality would leave societies more exposed to future shocks. By contrast, directing stimulus and recovery packages toward clean energy, sustainable transport, and resilient communities can help build economies that are both fairer and less fragile. This is an opportunity to redesign systems so that they protect people and the planet together, rather than sacrificing one for the other.

The pandemic has also highlighted the importance of compassion and cooperation. Communities have come together to care for one another, and governments have taken extraordinary measures to safeguard public health. These same values are essential for addressing the climate crisis. Fundamental shifts are needed: away from short-term profit and towards long-term wellbeing; away from division and towards shared responsibility; away from policies that deepen inequality and towards ones that promote justice and solidarity.

Resilience must be at the heart of these changes. The world faces overlapping crises—health emergencies like COVID-19, the accelerating climate emergency, and widening inequality. None of these can be solved in isolation. Efforts to protect people from one crisis must not undermine efforts to tackle another. This means rejecting false choices between economic recovery and environmental protection, and instead recognizing that a healthy environment underpins healthy societies and economies.

The temporary dip in emissions during the pandemic is not a climate strategy. Without deliberate, sustained action, pollution will rebound and the climate emergency will continue to escalate. The lesson from COVID-19 is not that crises automatically fix other crises, but that rapid, collective action is possible when the stakes are clear and the political will exists.

The path chosen now will determine whether we lock in more vulnerability and injustice, or move toward a future that is safer, more equitable, and more sustainable. By learning from the pandemic and applying those lessons to the climate emergency—using public resources for a just, green transition; strengthening public services and social protections; and fostering compassion and cooperation—we can build societies that are better prepared for the challenges ahead, and fairer for everyone.
