In São Gabriel da Cachoeira, deep in the Rio Negro region of the Brazilian Amazon, Indigenous communities faced the COVID-19 pandemic with a combination of traditional knowledge, local organization, and urgent solidarity.

Known as Brazil’s most Indigenous city, São Gabriel da Cachoeira is home to numerous Indigenous peoples whose languages, cultures, and elders carry centuries of knowledge. When COVID-19 began spreading, it threatened not only lives, but also the continuity of this cultural heritage. The health system quickly came under immense pressure and, as the pandemic advanced, the region saw a collapse in healthcare capacity and high mortality, especially among the most vulnerable Indigenous peoples.

In response, local actors moved quickly. The Coping with COVID-19 Committee was formed, bringing together city hall, Indigenous organizations such as FOIRN (the Federation of Indigenous Organizations of the Rio Negro), FUNAI, ISA, DSEI, and the Army. This coalition put in place a series of preventive measures designed specifically for the local reality.

Communication about the virus and prevention reached communities in their own languages, ensuring that vital information was accessible and culturally appropriate. Sanitary barriers were established to control the movement of people and reduce the risk of contagion entering and spreading between communities. Lockdown measures and mandatory mask use were adopted, even in the face of logistical and social challenges in such a vast and remote region.

While these measures helped slow the spread, the needs on the ground remained enormous. With minimal support from the federal government, local organizations and partners stepped in to help fill the gaps. Greenpeace, alongside partners, contributed by delivering COVID-19 tests, oxygen, personal protective equipment, food, and essential medical and logistical equipment to strengthen the fragile health response.

A key part of this effort was the creation of 12 field hospitals, known as UAPI, across the Rio Negro region. These units brought community-based treatment closer to where people live, reducing the need for long and difficult journeys to distant hospitals. By enabling earlier and more accessible care, the UAPI helped more people recover and reduced pressure on already overwhelmed health facilities.

For the Indigenous peoples of São Gabriel da Cachoeira, every recovered patient represents more than a life saved. It means the preservation of stories, languages, and ancestral wisdom—especially that held by elders, who have been among the most at risk during the pandemic. The combined efforts of Indigenous organizations, local authorities, health services, and supportive partners like Greenpeace helped protect not just health, but also the living memory and cultural continuity of the Rio Negro’s Indigenous communities at a time of profound vulnerability.
