Eleven years ago, Kate Nelson’s life changed when she came face to face with the reality of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. Seeing the scale of plastic pollution in the ocean pushed her to ask a difficult question: what would it take to live without plastic?

That question turned into a long-term commitment. Over more than a decade, Kate has worked to remove single-use plastics from her daily life. She stopped using items like plastic straws, bags, bottles, and cups, and replaced them with reusable alternatives. Cloth bags took the place of plastic shopping bags. Glass jars became a go-to for storage and refills. Refillable vessels became her standard for drinks and other liquids.

What began as a personal challenge became a lifestyle that reshaped how she eats, shops, and connects with others. Finding ways around single-use plastics pushed her to be more creative—thinking ahead, planning what she needed to bring, and discovering new ways to reuse what she already had. This shift also led to healthier eating habits, as avoiding plastic often meant moving away from heavily packaged, processed foods and toward fresher options. Along the way, she found community with others trying to reduce their plastic footprint, building relationships around shared values and practical tips.

Kate’s journey is not just about individual change; it’s also about collective action. She promotes Global Refill Day on November 6 as a way for people everywhere to participate in a growing reuse movement. The idea is simple: bring your reusable containers and bags to stores, ask staff to fill them instead of using single-use packaging, and document the experience.

By sharing photos and stories with the hashtags #ReuseRevolution and #BreakFreeFromPlastic, people can help make reuse more visible and more normal. Every shared image of a refillable bottle at a café or a glass jar at a bulk store sends a signal that there is demand for alternatives to throwaway plastics.

Kate’s message is that these everyday actions matter not only for reducing individual waste, but also for driving systemic change. When enough people show that reuse is possible and desirable, it increases pressure on companies to move away from single-use plastics and invest in refillable and reusable solutions. Her 11-year journey demonstrates how one person’s response to ocean plastic pollution can grow into a broader push for change—one refill, one conversation, and one shared photo at a time.
