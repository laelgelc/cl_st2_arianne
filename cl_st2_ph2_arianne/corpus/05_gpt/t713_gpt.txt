The Great Northern Forest stretches across Canada, Scandinavia, and Russia, forming one of the planet’s last vast wildernesses. It holds nearly a quarter of the world’s trees and stores more carbon than all tropical rainforests combined. For Greenpeace staff in Helsinki, a recent documentation trip brought home both its breathtaking beauty and the scale of the damage being done there.

In the forest, towering trees, clear rivers, and thriving wildlife create a landscape that feels almost endless. This is the home of Indigenous peoples such as the Sami and the Cree, whose cultures, livelihoods, and knowledge are deeply rooted in these lands. It is also a refuge for diverse species that depend on intact, old-growth ecosystems to survive.

Yet only 3% of this immense forest is currently protected. Industrial logging is rapidly turning ancient trees into disposable products, stripping the land of its natural defenses against climate change. When these forests are cut down, the carbon they store is released, and the Great Northern Forest risks becoming a massive carbon bomb instead of a crucial carbon sink.

For the Helsinki team, witnessing this contrast—between untouched forest and clear-cut devastation—underscored how urgently the Great Northern Forest needs protection. Safeguarding it is not just about saving trees; it is about defending a living system that stabilizes our climate, supports Indigenous communities, and shelters wildlife.

To help more people experience what is at stake, Greenpeace is inviting the public to explore the forest virtually. Through an augmented reality experience created with Arilyn, anyone with a compatible device can immerse themselves in the wonders and threats facing the Great Northern Forest. By bringing this remote ecosystem into everyday spaces, the AR app is designed to make the forest’s beauty, and its vulnerability, impossible to ignore.

Protecting the Great Northern Forest is essential for tackling the climate crisis. The choice is stark: allow it to be logged into short-lived products, or defend it as a living shield against global warming and a home for people and nature alike.
