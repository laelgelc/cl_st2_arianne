The Amazon River mouth, where the dark, sediment-rich waters of the world’s largest river meet the Atlantic Ocean, was long thought to be too muddy and low in light to host a vibrant reef ecosystem. Yet in 2016, scientists revealed something extraordinary: a vast, previously unknown reef system stretching from Brazil to French Guiana, covering an estimated 9,500 square kilometers.

This Amazon Reef is unlike the clear-water coral reefs many people imagine. It thrives in low-light, murky conditions with strong river influence. Giant sponges and extensive beds of rhodolith — nodules formed by red algae that create complex, reef-like structures — provide habitat and shelter for a wide variety of marine life. This unique biome is still only beginning to be understood, but it is already clear that it plays a vital role in the region’s ocean ecosystem.

Despite its recent discovery and scientific importance, the Amazon Reef is under immediate threat. Oil companies Total and BP have targeted the area for offshore oil exploration, with drilling blocks planned just eight kilometers from the reef. Any spill in such close proximity could have devastating consequences for this fragile environment.

Oil pollution would not only endanger the reef’s sponges and rhodolith formations, but also the many species that depend on the region’s waters, including endangered animals such as manatees, turtles, and otters. In a dynamic system shaped by river outflow and ocean currents, oil could spread quickly, making it extremely difficult to contain and clean up, and putting an irreplaceable ecosystem at risk before it has even been fully studied.

To confront this threat, Greenpeace has launched a campaign to protect the Amazon Reef and stop oil exploration in the area. Central to this effort is an expedition by the Greenpeace ship Esperanza, which is heading to the region to explore the reef underwater. Using submarines, the crew will document this hidden world in greater detail, helping to reveal its beauty and importance to people around the globe.

The Esperanza’s mission is not only scientific; it is also a call to action. By sharing images and information from beneath the surface, the expedition aims to build public pressure on companies like Total and BP to abandon their plans for oil drilling near the reef. Supporters are being urged to speak out and demand that this unique biome be protected from fossil fuel exploitation.

The Amazon Reef has existed out of sight for countless years, quietly sustaining life in one of the most challenging marine environments on Earth. Now that it has been brought to light, its future depends on choices being made today. Through this campaign, Greenpeace is working to ensure that the Amazon Reef is preserved, not sacrificed to short-term oil interests.
