LGBTQIA2S+ communities are on the frontlines of the climate crisis, not only because of where they live and work, but because of the discrimination they already face in daily life. When climate disasters strike, existing inequalities are magnified, and queer and trans people are too often left without protection, support, or even recognition.

LGBTQIA2S+ people, especially Black, Indigenous and other people of colour, experience higher rates of homelessness. This pushes many into precarious housing in polluted areas and disaster-prone zones, where floods, storms, fires, and heatwaves hit hardest. When evacuations and emergency responses begin, those same communities then face barriers that others do not.

During Hurricane Katrina, trans people were denied access to shelters or even jailed instead of being offered safety and care. After the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, Aravanis in India were excluded from relief efforts. These are not isolated incidents; they are examples of how transphobia, homophobia, racism, and other forms of discrimination can turn a natural hazard into a human-made catastrophe for queer and trans communities.

Climate justice and queer liberation are deeply interconnected. A safe climate requires safe, dignified lives for everyone, and that means centering those who are most impacted yet least protected. Building a just response to the climate crisis means listening to LGBTQIA2S+ communities, recognizing their leadership, and ensuring that emergency systems, housing, and social protections work for all of us.

Greenpeace is committed to fighting for nature and for all people, regardless of gender identity, sexual orientation, race, or any other part of who they are. Confronting the climate crisis demands collective action that refuses to leave anyone behind and insists that a livable planet must also be an equitable one.
