Climate chaos doesn’t hit everyone equally. Around the world, LGBTQIA2S+ people are already living at the sharp edge of multiple crises—and the climate emergency is making that edge even sharper.

When storms, floods, fires, and heatwaves strike, they collide with existing inequalities in housing, healthcare, and access to basic resources. For queer and trans communities, those inequalities are not abstract. They show up in where people can safely live, whether they can access shelter in an emergency, and how they’re treated when they seek help.

In the United States, LGBTQIA2S+ people face a dramatically higher risk of homelessness—120% higher than their non-LGBTQIA2S+ peers. Among young people, the picture is even starker: LGBTQIA2S+ youth make up an estimated 40% of the homeless youth population, despite being a minority of the overall youth population. For Black, Indigenous, and other racialized queer and trans youth, that burden is heavier still, as racism and queerphobia compound one another.

Homelessness and housing precarity mean greater exposure to extreme weather, pollution, and climate disasters. People without stable housing are more likely to live in areas with higher levels of toxic pollution, less green space, and weaker infrastructure. When disaster hits, those already pushed to the margins are often the least protected and the last to receive support.

History shows how this plays out. During Hurricane Katrina, trans people were denied access to emergency shelters because their gender identity did not match the expectations of staff or rules on paper. One trans woman was even jailed instead of being given safe refuge. After the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, Aravanis—a community of gender-diverse people in parts of India—were excluded from aid distribution, left without the support they needed to survive and rebuild.

These are not isolated incidents; they are part of a pattern where queer and trans lives are treated as expendable in moments of crisis. Climate disasters magnify the violence and discrimination that LGBTQIA2S+ communities already face, from being turned away at shelters to being ignored in relief planning and resource distribution.

The queer and climate justice movements are deeply interconnected. Both are struggles for dignity, safety, and the right to live and thrive. Both demand that systems built on exclusion and exploitation be transformed. Fighting for climate justice means fighting for everyone on the frontlines of the crisis—including LGBTQIA2S+ people whose stories are too often erased.

Greenpeace is committed to fighting for all people and the planet. The rainbow flag, a symbol of queer resistance and joy, includes green—a reminder that our struggles are bound together with the living world we depend on. Defending the climate means defending queer and trans lives. Standing up for LGBTQIA2S+ rights means standing up for a safer, more just world, on a safer, more just planet.

In this shared struggle, unity is not optional—it is essential. Queer liberation and climate justice rise together, or not at all.
