In August 1945, the world witnessed devastation on a scale never seen before. The atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki killed over 214,000 people by the end of that year, and the suffering did not end there. Survivors continued to endure the lasting effects of radiation exposure, with impacts on health, families and communities that stretched across generations.

Less than a decade later, in 1953, U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower delivered his “Atoms for Peace” speech, promoting nuclear power as a way to harness atomic energy for constructive, civilian purposes. This vision helped reframe nuclear technology in the public imagination, from a weapon of mass destruction to a supposed engine of progress and modernity.

Japan, still living with the trauma of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, nonetheless embarked on a nuclear path. In 1966, the country built its first nuclear power plant. Over the following decades, the nuclear program expanded, even as the world watched serious nuclear incidents unfold elsewhere, including Three Mile Island in the United States and Chernobyl in the former Soviet Union. These events raised alarms about safety and long-term risks, but they did not halt Japan’s commitment to nuclear energy.

That changed dramatically in 2011. The Fukushima disaster forced more than 160,000 people from their homes. Many of them are still affected, facing long-term displacement, disruption of livelihoods, and ongoing uncertainty about their future. Fukushima made clear that the consequences of nuclear accidents are neither temporary nor easily contained; they touch land, sea, communities and generations.

Against this backdrop, the idea that nuclear energy can be truly “peaceful” is called into question. The same technology that produced the horrors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki underpins the reactors that power the grid. The chain from uranium mining to waste storage, from accident risk to unresolved contamination, contradicts the promise of a benign, risk-free energy source.

The argument put forward is that nuclear energy is not a path to peace. For Japan, a country that has already borne the brunt of nuclear devastation and nuclear disaster, continuing to rely on this technology deepens existing vulnerabilities rather than resolving them. Instead, the author urges Japan to abandon nuclear power and commit fully to renewable energy.

Shifting to renewables is framed not only as an energy choice, but as a moral and social one: a way to foster peace, protect people and the environment, and support sustainable development. By embracing renewable energy, Japan can move away from the shadow of nuclear risks and build a future grounded in safety, resilience and genuine peace.
