When the first reports of COVID-19 reached São Gabriel da Cachoeira, in the Brazilian Amazon, Indigenous artisans Elizângela da Silva (Baré) and Janete Alves (Desana) were focused on their usual work: handicrafts that help sustain families and keep ancestral knowledge alive. As the pandemic advanced and news showed people sewing masks at home, they decided to transform their skills into a tool for collective protection.

From their roles as coordinators of the Women’s Department of FOIRN (Federation of Indigenous Organizations of the Rio Negro), they began mobilizing other artisans in the region. Using patterns that had been donated and online tutorials as guidance, they organized a network of women to produce protective masks for Indigenous communities along the Rio Negro.

What started as a response to worrying images on television quickly became a large-scale effort. Together, they produced more than 16,000 masks, which were distributed to 23 Indigenous Peoples in the Rio Negro region. This work was supported financially by the “Rio Negro, Nós Cuidamos” (“Rio Negro, We Take Care”) project, and strengthened by Greenpeace’s Wings of Emergency initiative, which provided sewing machines to expand production.

Behind the numbers lies a story marked by grief and resilience. The pandemic brought painful losses to these communities, including elders who were cremated without the traditional funeral rites that are essential to Indigenous cultural and spiritual life. Amid this mourning, the women continued their work, driven by the urgency to protect their peoples.

Alongside the use of masks, communities have also turned to traditional medicines, drawing on ancestral knowledge to care for the sick and strengthen health. For Elizângela, Janete, and the artisans involved, each mask sewn is an act of resistance and love, a way to honor those who have been lost and to safeguard the lives and cultures of the peoples of the Rio Negro.
