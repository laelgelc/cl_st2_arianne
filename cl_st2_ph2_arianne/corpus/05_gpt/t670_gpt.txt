In communities across the Philippines and around the world, women are stepping forward to demand that the biggest polluters on the planet answer for the damage they have caused. Their fight is rooted in lived experience, deep loss, and a powerful vision of justice that reaches far beyond their own lifetimes.

In 2015, a groundbreaking petition was filed with the Commission on Human Rights of the Philippines. It called on the Commission to investigate the responsibility of major oil, gas, coal, and cement companies – including ExxonMobil, BP, Chevron, and Shell – for the human rights impacts of climate change. This petition opened the door for a historic inquiry into whether the world’s largest carbon producers can be held accountable for the harm their products have helped unleash.

Desiree Llanos Dee has been at the heart of efforts to connect these global carbon producers to the people whose lives are being upended by climate impacts. Inspired by the 2015 Rome-to-Paris Climate Walk, she has worked to bridge the gap between boardrooms and battered coastlines, policy debates and flooded homes. Her campaigning focuses on linking the emissions of powerful corporations to the real stories of those living on the frontlines of the climate crisis in the Philippines.

Climate lawyer Kristin Casper has been supporting this work at the global level. Through her legal expertise, she helps to bolster efforts to push for accountability from fossil fuel and cement companies, reinforcing the message that climate change is not only an environmental issue, but a profound human rights challenge. Her role underscores that the struggle for climate justice is also a struggle for legal recognition of the harms communities are enduring.

Survivors’ voices lie at the core of the Commission’s inquiry. Marielle Bacason, who lived through the terror of Super Typhoon Haiyan in 2013, carries the trauma of one of the most powerful storms ever to hit the Philippines. By sharing her testimony, she puts a human face to the statistics and headlines, reminding the world that behind every “extreme weather event” are families torn apart and communities struggling to rebuild.

Veronica “Derek” Cabe, whose life was upended by Typhoon Ketsana in 2009, also stepped forward to testify. Her experience of loss and disruption fuels her determination to speak out for climate and gender justice. For her, and for many others, holding major polluters to account is not only about redress for past harms, but about protecting those who will inherit the climate crisis in the years to come.

Together, these women are helping to transform grief and anger into a powerful demand for accountability. By bringing community stories into a formal human rights process, they are challenging some of the most powerful companies in the world to answer for their role in driving climate change. Their work is a reminder that the fight for climate justice is also a fight for dignity, equity, and the rights of future generations.

Their courage, persistence, and solidarity show that when people on the frontlines speak out, they can reshape the global conversation on responsibility and justice in the era of climate change.
