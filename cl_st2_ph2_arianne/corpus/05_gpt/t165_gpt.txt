In Amsterdam, Greenpeace volunteers from 16 countries joined Brazilian Indigenous leaders to block a ship carrying 60 million kilos of soy from Brazil. Their message was directed squarely at EU decision-makers: Europe must adopt a strong anti‑deforestation law that truly protects forests, vital ecosystems, and Indigenous rights.

The protest highlighted serious gaps in the current draft of the law. Key ecosystems such as the Brazilian Cerrado are excluded, even though they are critically important for biodiversity and for the communities who depend on them. The draft also contains weak provisions on human rights, failing to adequately protect Indigenous Peoples and local communities whose lands and livelihoods are threatened by agricultural expansion. At the same time, some corporations are pushing back against requirements for transparency in their supply chains, attempting to water down rules that would reveal where products come from and what damage they cause.

EU imports of soy are a major driver of this destruction. Most of the soy Europe buys is not eaten directly by people; it is used as animal feed in industrial livestock production. This demand fuels deforestation and ecosystem destruction in Brazil and beyond, and it intensifies pressure on Indigenous territories and communities.

The action in Amsterdam also pointed to the changes needed within Europe itself. To protect health, nature, and the climate, meat and dairy consumption in the EU must fall dramatically—by around 70% by 2030. Cutting demand for industrially produced meat and dairy would reduce the pressure to clear forests and other ecosystems for soy and other feed crops.

Across Europe, more than a million people have already called for strong action. Their demand is clear: a robust EU anti‑deforestation law that closes loopholes, defends Indigenous rights, covers threatened ecosystems like the Cerrado, and is backed by a rapid shift away from high meat and dairy consumption.
