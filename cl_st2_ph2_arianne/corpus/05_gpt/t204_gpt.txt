For more than two decades, a bright green ship carrying a single, powerful word on its bow cut through oceans across the globe: Esperanza – “Hope.”

Esperanza didn’t start its life as a Greenpeace vessel. It began as a Russian fire-fighting ship, built for a very different purpose. That changed when it was renamed through an online vote, and people around the world chose a new identity for it: Esperanza. From that moment, the ship took on a new role – one rooted in protection, solidarity, and resistance.

As the fastest ship in the Greenpeace fleet, and built to operate in icy waters, Esperanza became a vital tool in exposing and confronting environmental destruction in some of the most remote places on Earth. Its crews and activists sailed into the Antarctic and off the coast of West Africa, where they challenged pirate fishing operations, opposed whaling, and helped uncover environmental crimes far from public view.

The ship was not only a platform for direct action. It also hosted scientific work and documentation, supporting studies that shed light on what was happening out at sea and in fragile ecosystems. And when disaster struck, Esperanza was there too. After the 2010 earthquake in Haiti and during Typhoon Bopha in 2012, the ship helped deliver aid and support to communities in crisis.

Over time, Esperanza became more than a vessel. It was a symbol – of determination at sea, of solidarity with people and nature, and of the possibility of change. Its name captured what it represented to those who sailed on it and to those who followed its journeys from afar.

Yet even a ship called “Hope” has limits in a world that must rapidly move away from fossil fuels. Despite efforts to make it greener, Esperanza still carried a significant carbon footprint. Keeping it in service would not match the direction Greenpeace is committed to: a future built on zero-carbon solutions.

Now, Esperanza is retired in Gijón, Spain. It no longer chases illegal fishing vessels or navigates ice-strewn waters, but the decision to let it go is part of the same commitment that once sent it to the ends of the Earth: protecting the climate and our shared home.

Esperanza’s journeys have ended, but the spirit that powered them has not. The courage, solidarity, and hope that once sailed on its decks now move in new forms of action, new campaigns, and new tools for a zero-carbon world. The ship rests in port, but the work – and the hope it stood for – continues.
