Across the planet, our cities are at a crossroads. Humanity has reached 8 billion people, and more than half of us now live in urban areas. These cities are responsible for around 70% of global CO2 emissions, but they are also places where radical climate transformations can – and must – happen.

Over the next 30 years, most urban growth will take place in Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean. These regions are already experiencing the overlapping pressures of climate breakdown and deep social inequality. As cities expand, the way they grow will shape the lives and rights of billions of people – especially those who are already marginalized.

A justice approach to climate change starts with a simple truth: those who are most affected must be protected, included and heard. In cities, that means centering the experiences of people living in informal settlements, workers in precarious jobs, communities exposed to pollution and flooding, and all those who have historically been pushed to the edges of power.

The voices coming from frontline cities show that Urban Justice is not an abstract idea; it is being built every day by people working for healthier, greener urban spaces. They are organizing for clean air, safe housing, access to nature, reliable public transport, and protection from climate impacts. They are demanding that climate solutions do not reproduce existing injustices, but instead help dismantle them.

Urban Justice means tackling inequalities in an intersectional way – understanding how class, race, gender, migration status, disability and other factors combine to shape who is most at risk, and who is most excluded from decisions. It means recognizing that local, community-led solutions can offer new models of cities where climate and social justice are at the center, not an afterthought.

Grassroots movements are pushing hard for a real say in how their cities are planned and governed. They are insisting on participation in decision-making, not just consultation. They are showing that when communities lead, climate action becomes more ambitious, more equitable and more rooted in everyday realities.

In this moment of rapid urban change, the question is not whether our cities will transform, but who they will serve in the process. Will they become greener only for a privileged few, or will they be reshaped to protect and uplift those on the frontlines of the climate crisis?
