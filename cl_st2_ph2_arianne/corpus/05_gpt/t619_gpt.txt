Sailing through the Verde Island Passage in the Philippines, the Rainbow Warrior crew has seen firsthand how plastic pollution is invading every corner of our oceans. Even the smallest marine life is not spared: fragments of plastic are turning up where we should only be finding thriving ecosystems. This is one of the most biodiverse marine areas on the planet, yet it is being choked by throwaway plastic.

In this crisis, Nestlé plays a major role. The company uses 1.7 million tonnes of plastic every year. Instead of going down, that figure has grown by 5% over the last five years. A staggering 98% of this is single-use packaging—designed to be used once and then discarded. This dependence on disposable plastic has helped make Nestlé the third largest plastic polluter in the world.

The scale of this problem is no accident. It is the result of a business model built on single-use packaging. That model has unleashed a plastic monster that is now contaminating coastlines, rivers, and oceans, and threatening communities and wildlife alike. Nestlé has a responsibility to confront the damage caused by this system and to help stop the flow of plastic at its source.

The solutions are clear. Nestlé must phase out single-use plastics and move away from a throwaway approach to packaging. Instead of relying on more plastic production and false fixes, the company needs to invest in refill and reuse systems that drastically reduce the need for disposable packaging. These systems can cut pollution before it starts, rather than trying to clean up the mess afterward.

Nestlé itself has acknowledged that recycling alone is not enough to solve the plastic crisis. Yet its actions have not matched the urgency of its words. While the company recognizes the limits of recycling, it has not made the rapid, transformative changes needed to move away from single-use plastics.

Around the world, people are demanding more. As part of the #BreakFreeFromPlastic movement, activists delivered a “plastic monster” to Unilever’s headquarters in Rotterdam, a symbol of the crisis created by companies that continue to rely on throwaway plastics. Now, activists are sailing up the Rhine River on the Beluga to confront Nestlé directly with the same message: it is time to take responsibility for the plastic monster it created.

The Rainbow Warrior’s journey through the Verde Island Passage, and the Beluga’s voyage up the Rhine, are united by a single call: Nestlé must act now. Phasing out single-use plastics and investing in refill and reuse systems are not optional add-ons—they are essential steps to protect our oceans, our climate, and our future.
