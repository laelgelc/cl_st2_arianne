Greenpeace has long campaigned for clothing that is both affordable and free from hazardous chemicals. This work is grounded in the understanding that what we wear should not come at the cost of polluted rivers, unsafe factories, or toxic exposure for workers and communities.

In 2011, Greenpeace launched the Detox My Fashion campaign to push the textile industry to eliminate hazardous chemicals from production. As part of putting its own principles into practice, Greenpeace suspended the sale of its own textile products in 2012. That decision will remain in place until there is transparent, verifiable proof that these products can be made without hazardous chemicals.

The campaign has helped shift the industry. Since its launch, 80 companies have committed to eliminate hazardous chemicals from their supply chains by 2020. The “Destination Zero” report documents how this has led to greater transparency and improvements in supply chain management, and has also prompted broader initiatives across the fashion sector.

In 2018, a pilot project showed that Detox-compliant production is achievable in practice. Building on that experience, Greenpeace began trialling a new standard in April 2019 for a limited range of merchandise such as t-shirts and bags. This trial uses best available practices and independent third-party tools to support the elimination of hazardous chemicals and to ensure transparency along the supply chain. Only selected suppliers are involved in this process.

Despite these steps forward, the general suspension of Greenpeace textile merchandise remains in place. The ongoing trials aim to demonstrate that truly Detox-compliant products are possible, and to help set a benchmark for safer, more transparent clothing production across the industry.
