Greenpeace has been asked many times about the claims made in the documentary *Cowspiracy*, especially the suggestion that major environmental NGOs are influenced by the meat industry. Greenpeace does not accept funding from governments or corporations, including those linked to animal agriculture. This independence is central to being able to confront powerful industries and demand change without conflicts of interest.

Animal agriculture is a major driver of environmental destruction. It is responsible for around 18% of global greenhouse gas emissions and plays a significant role in the ongoing destruction of the Amazon rainforest. Large areas of forest are cleared for cattle ranching and for growing soya that is then used as animal feed for livestock and fish farming. Destructive fishing practices also threaten ocean ecosystems and the people who depend on them.

Greenpeace campaigns directly target these drivers. Work on cattle ranching and Amazon deforestation helped push global brands to change their supply chains. Nike stopped buying leather linked to cattle raised in the Amazon. A major World Bank loan that would have supported damaging cattle expansion in the region was withdrawn. Campaigning on soya used for animal feed led to reforms in McDonald’s supply chain, reducing pressure on the Amazon. In the oceans, sustained pressure on the tuna industry has helped secure improvements in tuna fishing practices.

These victories show that systemic change is possible when companies and financial institutions are forced to confront their role in environmental harm. But transforming the food system also means changing how much and what kind of animal products are produced and consumed.

Greenpeace supports a shift toward more plant-based diets and encourages people who can do so to eat less meat and dairy, or go vegan. At the same time, they recognise that food is deeply tied to culture, livelihood, and access. Not everyone has the same options or resources, and it is neither fair nor effective to place the entire burden of change on individuals while letting major polluters continue business as usual.

That is why Greenpeace focuses on changing the system as a whole: redirecting public money away from industrial animal agriculture, protecting forests and oceans, and pushing companies and governments to transform how food is produced. Within this broader transformation, they have set a goal of reducing global meat and dairy consumption by 50% by 2050.

This approach combines personal action with structural change. It acknowledges the environmental urgency of tackling animal agriculture’s impacts, while also recognising the realities of culture, equity, and accessibility in the global food system.
