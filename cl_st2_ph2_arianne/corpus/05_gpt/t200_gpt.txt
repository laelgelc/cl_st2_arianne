Industrial fishing fleets targeting squid are rapidly transforming our oceans – and not for the better. Vast armadas of industrial vessels are sweeping through key marine regions, taking far more than squid alone and leaving a trail of damage that reaches from the depths of the sea to coastal communities onshore.

Greenpeace’s latest report exposes how this booming squid industry is expanding at a pace that marine wildlife and governance systems simply cannot withstand. In the North-West Indian Ocean, the number of squid vessels has exploded by more than 800% in just five years. In the South-West Atlantic, fleets of more than 500 vessels at a time are now operating like floating factories, concentrating enormous fishing pressure in relatively small areas.

These fleets don’t just catch squid. Sharks, rays, dolphins and other marine wildlife are being decimated as collateral damage. The highly industrialized methods used to target squid are undermining the health of entire ecosystems, disrupting food webs and pushing already vulnerable species closer to the brink.

For coastal communities and small-scale, sustainable fishers, this is not an abstract problem. When industrial fleets move in, they deplete the shared resources that local people depend on for food and income. Squid and other marine life that once supported coastal livelihoods are being scooped up in huge quantities on the high seas, far from the eyes of the public and, too often, beyond the reach of effective regulation.

A major part of the problem is that vast areas of international waters remain largely unregulated. In these parts of the global ocean, industrialization can advance almost unchecked. Without strong rules, monitoring and enforcement, powerful fleets can overexploit marine life with little accountability, deepening the crisis for ocean ecosystems and the people who rely on them.

This is why a strong Global Ocean Treaty is urgently needed. Such a treaty is essential to bring real regulation to high seas fisheries, curb destructive practices and ensure that the global ocean is managed in the interests of people and planet – not just short-term profit. A robust treaty would enable the creation of ocean sanctuaries where marine life can recover, and provide tools to protect biodiversity, stabilize ecosystems and support climate resilience.

Protecting the oceans is also about food security and livelihoods. Healthy marine ecosystems underpin the nutrition and income of millions of people worldwide. If industrial fleets are allowed to continue decimating wildlife and undermining sustainable fisheries, the consequences will echo far beyond the water’s edge.

Around the world, people are demanding change. Nearly five million individuals have already signed a petition calling on governments to act for the oceans. Their message is clear: we need strong global rules to safeguard marine life, defend coastal communities and ensure that our shared seas can continue to sustain life on Earth.

The future of the oceans – and all of us who depend on them – hinges on whether governments listen to this call and deliver a Global Ocean Treaty capable of reining in destructive industrial fishing and creating the protections our blue planet urgently needs.
