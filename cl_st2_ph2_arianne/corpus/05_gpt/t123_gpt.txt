The Amazon rainforest is being pushed toward a dangerous tipping point by deforestation and intentional fires. Much of this destruction is driven by agribusiness and global meat consumption, which turn the forest into cattle pastures. On public lands cleared in the Amazon, 75% are converted into pasture for cattle, showing how closely linked forest loss is to the industrial meat supply chain.

Many of the fires that devastate the Amazon are not natural. They are often illegal and deliberately set by land grabbers who clear forest to claim and exploit public land. These fires threaten Indigenous peoples whose territories and cultures depend on the forest, and they endanger the Amazon’s extraordinary biodiversity. The rainforest also plays a vital role in stabilizing the global climate, storing vast amounts of carbon and influencing rainfall patterns far beyond South America.

Under the government of Jair Bolsonaro, anti-environment policies weakened protections and enforcement in the Amazon. During this period, deforestation increased by 52.9%. Fires rose as well, with a 16.7% increase recorded in early 2022. This surge in destruction is pushing the Amazon closer to a tipping point. Scientists warn that if 20–25% of the forest is lost, large parts of the Amazon could shift from rainforest to a drier savanna-like ecosystem. Such a transformation would have profound consequences for Indigenous communities, wildlife, and the global climate.

There are clear pathways to prevent further destruction. Enforcing existing environmental laws and cracking down on illegal deforestation and land grabbing are essential. Expanding and effectively managing protected areas can safeguard critical forest regions. Recognizing and upholding Indigenous land rights is also crucial, as Indigenous peoples are among the most effective guardians of the forest.

At the same time, the global food system must change. The current model, which relies heavily on expanding cattle pastures and agricultural frontiers into forests, is unsustainable. Reforming how food is produced and consumed—especially reducing the pressure that industrial meat production places on forests—is key to stopping the Amazon’s destruction and avoiding the tipping point that could permanently alter this irreplaceable ecosystem.
