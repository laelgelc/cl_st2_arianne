Across the Americas, women and gender-diverse people are confronting the climate crisis from the frontlines of their communities, linking environmental destruction with gender inequality, racism, and social injustice. Their stories show that the fight for climate justice is inseparable from the struggles of Black, Indigenous, LGBTQ+, and low-income communities whose lives and lands are most at risk.

In Brazil, Cláudia Farinha works to defend rural women’s rights, using communication as a tool for environmental organizing. For her, amplifying the voices of women who live closest to the land is essential to protecting it. By strengthening networks of rural women, she helps build the power needed to resist environmental harm and demand policies that respect both people and nature.

In Mexico, Jackie Zamora shares her journey with Greenpeace and reflects on the dangers women environmental defenders face. Her experience underscores how women who speak out against destructive projects often face threats, intimidation, and violence. Yet she continues, insisting that environmental activism must center the safety, leadership, and autonomy of women if it is to be truly transformative.

In the United States, Julialynne Walker focuses on community gardening and education. Through growing food and sharing knowledge, she connects neighbors to the land and to each other, building resilience in the face of climate and social crises. Her work shows how local, community-based initiatives can nourish both bodies and movements, especially in communities that have long been denied access to healthy food and green spaces.

A Brazilian trans woman activist draws a direct line between gender-based violence, human rights, and environmental access. For her, the right to live free from violence is bound up with the right to clean air, water, and safe public spaces. She highlights how trans and gender-diverse people face heightened vulnerability in a warming world, and how environmental justice must include the defense of their lives and dignity.

From Canada, a glaciologist contributes scientific research on glaciers to this shared struggle. As ice melts and water systems shift, her work documents the accelerating impacts of the climate crisis. She also emphasizes international solidarity, recognizing that what happens to glaciers in one part of the world affects communities everywhere, and that science must be paired with global cooperation and justice.

In Chile, Maria Paz Valenzuela uses mountaineering as a path to empowerment and planetary care. For her, climbing mountains is not only about personal challenge but also about cultivating responsibility toward fragile ecosystems. By taking more women into high-altitude environments and sharing these experiences, she fosters leadership, confidence, and a deeper commitment to protecting the Earth.

An Indigenous Brazilian student brings the perspective of youth fighting for their lands and the climate. Their activism defends territories that are vital for biodiversity and cultural survival, insisting that Indigenous rights and land protection are central to any real climate solution. Their voice is a reminder that the future of the planet depends on respecting the knowledge and sovereignty of Indigenous peoples.

In the United States, Billie Lee connects trans rights with food sustainability and protests against the oil industry. She highlights how trans communities are affected by pollution, economic precarity, and food insecurity, while also being powerful agents of change. By linking campaigns for sustainable food systems with actions against fossil fuels, she shows how defending trans lives and defending the climate are part of the same struggle.

Across these stories, a common thread emerges: the climate crisis is not only an environmental issue but a justice issue. Women, Indigenous peoples, Black communities, LGBTQ+ people, and low-income neighborhoods are bearing the brunt of climate impacts while also leading the way toward solutions. Their experiences point to collective action, community education, and international solidarity as essential tools for change.

They speak with urgency, calling on all of us to recognize that the window for action is closing, and that silence and inaction only deepen existing inequalities. By listening to and standing with those on the frontlines—rural women, youth, scientists, trans activists, Indigenous defenders, and community organizers—we can confront the intertwined crises of climate breakdown and social injustice, and build a more just and livable world for everyone.
