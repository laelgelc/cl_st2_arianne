Around the world, our food system is failing the very people it is supposed to nourish. It fuels ill health, drives environmental destruction, and deepens inequality. While corporations profit from industrial agriculture and long, fragile supply chains, millions struggle to afford a decent meal. At the same time, mountains of perfectly edible food are wasted every day. This is not a system in crisis by accident; it is a system designed to prioritise profit over people and the planet.

The Covid-19 pandemic exposed these cracks even more brutally. As economies shut down, many urban poor communities were pushed to the brink of hunger. With jobs lost and incomes slashed, people living in cities found themselves caught between soaring food prices and empty plates. In a world that already produces more than enough food, this widespread insecurity is a stark indictment of how broken our food system has become.

Yet in the middle of this injustice, people are building their own solutions. In Chiang Mai, Thailand, Supawut Boonmahathanakorn and his team refused to accept that food insecurity was inevitable. During the pandemic, they looked at a 4,800-square-meter vacant dumping ground in the city and saw not waste, but possibility. With support from the local community and municipal authorities, they transformed this neglected plot into an urban farm.

What grew out of that space is more than just vegetables. The farm produces organic crops such as morning glories and corn, proving that healthy food can be grown right where people live, without relying on chemical-intensive industrial agriculture. Harvests are shared with community members, helping to ease the pressure on families facing food insecurity. Any surplus is sold, creating income that helps keep the project going and demonstrates how local, people-powered food systems can be both just and sustainable.

The farm also supports soup kitchens, turning fresh, locally grown produce into meals for those who need them most. In a city where many are excluded from the benefits of the global food economy, this is a direct challenge to the idea that hunger is unavoidable. It shows that when land, knowledge, and community are brought together, people can take back control over how their food is grown and who it serves.

Beyond feeding people, the space has become a place for learning and organising. It offers educational opportunities where community members can see, touch, and understand what a different kind of food system looks like. In doing so, it helps spread the idea of food sovereignty: the right of people to define their own food systems, prioritising local needs, ecological care, and social justice over corporate interests.

This urban farm in Chiang Mai is not a silver bullet, and it does not pretend to fix everything that is broken in the global food system. But it is a powerful example of what becomes possible when communities reclaim land, challenge waste, and insist that food must nourish people and the planet, not just profit margins. In a world of empty supermarket shelves for some and overflowing bins for others, people-powered initiatives like this are planting the seeds of a fairer, more resilient future.
