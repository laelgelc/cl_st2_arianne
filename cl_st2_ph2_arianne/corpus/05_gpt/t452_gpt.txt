World Tuna Day is a moment to celebrate one of the ocean’s most extraordinary creatures. Tuna are fast, powerful, and capable of travelling vast distances across the high seas. Their size and beauty have inspired coastal cultures and sustained communities for generations. But behind the cans and steaks on supermarket shelves lies a story that is far less inspiring.

Industrial fishing has pushed many tuna populations to the brink and continues to damage ocean ecosystems. Massive fleets, often operating far from their home ports, use methods that scoop up not just tuna but a whole web of marine life. Turtles, sharks and many other species are caught as bycatch, injured or killed in nets and on longlines meant for tuna. This wasteful and destructive approach tears at the fabric of marine biodiversity and undermines the health of the ocean as a whole.

Illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing makes the situation even worse. When vessels hide their catches, fish in prohibited areas, or ignore agreed rules, it becomes nearly impossible to manage tuna stocks responsibly. IUU fishing undermines conservation measures, cheats coastal communities, and allows the most destructive operators to gain an unfair advantage over those trying to follow the rules.

The human cost is also profound. Many distant water fishing vessels rely on migrant workers, who can find themselves trapped in dangerous and exploitative conditions. Reports from across the industry have highlighted long hours, unsafe working environments, and wages that are delayed or withheld altogether. These abuses are part of the same system that treats tuna and other marine life as limitless resources to be extracted, rather than living beings within a fragile ecosystem.

There is another path. Small-scale, ethical fisheries offer a model that respects both people and the planet. When governments invest in these community-based operations, they help build local economies instead of concentrating profits in the hands of a few large companies. Small-scale fishers are closely tied to the waters they depend on, giving them a powerful incentive to protect fish populations and habitats for the long term.

Supporting these fisheries is also a way to strengthen worker rights. Transparent, local supply chains make it easier to ensure fair pay and safe conditions. When fishers can earn a decent livelihood from sustainable practices, they are better able to feed their families, contribute to their communities, and help steward the ocean that sustains them.

The COVID-19 pandemic exposed how fragile global food systems can be. Disruptions in transport and trade highlighted the risk of depending on long, opaque supply chains that stretch across oceans. Investing in small-scale, sustainable fisheries can make food systems more resilient, ensuring that coastal communities and consumers alike have reliable access to nutritious seafood, even in times of crisis.

A just transition away from destructive industrial methods and toward sustainable, equitable fishing is not only possible, it is essential. By shifting support and subsidies from harmful practices to responsible ones, governments can help tuna populations recover, safeguard marine life from bycatch, and uphold the rights and dignity of workers at sea. Stronger local fleets, healthier oceans, and fairer working conditions are all part of the same solution.

This World Tuna Day is a chance to recognise tuna not just as a commodity, but as a symbol of what is at stake in our relationship with the ocean. Choosing to back small-scale, ethical fisheries and demanding that governments do the same can help secure a future where tuna thrive, coastal communities flourish, and global supply chains are both sustainable and just.
