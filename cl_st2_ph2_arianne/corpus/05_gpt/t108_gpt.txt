World leaders are gathering in Montreal for the UN biodiversity conference, CBD COP15, at a moment when life on Earth is in deep crisis. The world is facing accelerating biodiversity loss and the real risk of mass extinctions, yet this emergency still does not receive the political attention it demands. While the climate crisis rightly dominates headlines, the collapse of ecosystems is just as serious – and deeply intertwined with climate breakdown – but far less visible in public debate and on political agendas.

This is why Greenpeace is urging heads of state and government ministers not to treat CBD COP15 as a minor technical meeting, but as a defining political moment. Their presence and leadership are essential to secure a strong global agreement and to ensure it is actually implemented when they return home.

At the heart of the negotiations is the need for ambitious protections for nature, including a global commitment to safeguard at least 30% of the world’s land and seas by 2030. This is not just about drawing lines on a map. Effective protection must mean real safeguards for ecosystems, species and genetic diversity, not paper parks or empty promises.

Central to any credible outcome is the recognition of Indigenous rights and the leadership of Indigenous Peoples. Indigenous territories already hold much of the world’s remaining biodiversity, yet Indigenous communities are too often excluded from decisions that affect their lands and waters. Greenpeace is calling for Indigenous Peoples to be at the centre of decision‑making and to receive direct access to funding to support their stewardship of nature.

Implementation will make or break any agreement reached in Montreal. Commitments on paper are meaningless if they are not backed by action in every country. That includes substantial and predictable funding for countries in the Global South and others that have been most impacted by colonialism and historical exploitation, and that now carry a disproportionate burden in protecting global biodiversity. Without this support, ambitious targets will remain out of reach.

The stakes could not be higher. Biodiversity underpins our health, our economies and our ability to respond to the climate crisis. From food and water security to medicines, livelihoods and natural climate solutions, our societies depend on thriving ecosystems. Allowing this crisis to continue unchecked would undermine efforts to tackle climate change and deepen global inequality.

Greenpeace is issuing an open invitation – and a clear challenge – to political leaders: come to Montreal, take this crisis seriously, and use your power to secure a strong, just and effective global agreement for nature. The decisions made at CBD COP15 will shape the future of life on Earth. Leaders must show up, step up, and act.
