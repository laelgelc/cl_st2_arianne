Air pollution is a serious health concern, but there are practical steps people can take in their daily lives to reduce exposure. Simple changes in routine can make a meaningful difference, especially for those who walk, cycle, or spend long periods near busy roads.

One way to lower exposure is to choose when and where to exercise outdoors. Exercising in the early morning or in the evening, when the air is often clearer, can help reduce the amount of pollution you breathe in compared with peak traffic times. Choosing side streets instead of main roads can also have a big impact: taking quieter routes can cut exposure to air pollution by up to 60%. This is especially relevant for people who commute on foot or by bike and have some flexibility in the routes they choose.

Green spaces offer another important opportunity for cleaner air. Visiting local parks can provide a break from traffic fumes and typically offer cleaner air than busy streets. Time in nature also brings mental health benefits, making parks a valuable refuge both for physical and emotional wellbeing.

Even small shifts in how people position themselves near traffic can help. When walking along busy roads, staying further from the curb increases the distance from vehicle exhausts. At traffic lights and junctions, where emissions can build up, standing a few steps back from the road can reduce exposure to concentrated pollution. This is particularly important for children, who are closer to exhaust pipes because of their height and are more vulnerable to the effects of polluted air.

At home, how windows are used can influence indoor air quality. Opening windows that face away from busy roads helps ventilate homes with relatively cleaner air, rather than drawing in pollution from heavy traffic.

While these day-to-day measures help people protect themselves, they do not solve the root of the problem. Long-term protection from air pollution depends on transforming the transport system. Switching to clean transport, including electric vehicles, is essential for reducing harmful emissions. Greenpeace campaigns for this transition and calls on governments to take ambitious action to lower pollution levels. Systemic change, alongside individual protection measures, is crucial to securing cleaner air for everyone.
