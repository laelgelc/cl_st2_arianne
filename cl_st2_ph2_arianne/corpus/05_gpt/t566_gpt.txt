Steve Sawyer’s life traced the arc of the modern environmental movement, from the decks of the Rainbow Warrior to the front lines of international climate and energy policy. His passing on July 31, 2019, from lung cancer marked the loss of a leader whose courage and persistence helped reshape how the world thinks about our shared planet.

Steve became Executive Director of Greenpeace International in 1988, stepping into the role at a time when environmental threats were escalating and global awareness was only beginning to catch up. Under his leadership, Greenpeace helped secure some of the most significant environmental protections of the late 20th century.

He played a central role in the campaign to protect Antarctica from oil exploration, helping to keep one of the last great wildernesses on Earth free from drilling. He was deeply involved in the work that led to the Montreal Protocol on ozone-depleting gases, a landmark agreement that set the world on a path to phasing out chemicals that were tearing a hole in the planet’s protective ozone layer. Steve’s tenure also saw the end of sea dumping of radioactive waste, closing a dark chapter in the industrial use of the oceans as a dumping ground. At the same time, he was among the early voices pushing climate change onto the global agenda, when the issue was still unfamiliar to many policymakers and the public.

Long before he was helping shape international agreements, Steve was a young activist at sea. Aboard the Rainbow Warrior, he took part in missions that defined Greenpeace’s identity: direct, peaceful confrontation with environmental injustice. One of the most powerful of these missions was the relocation of the residents of Rongelap atoll, whose home had been contaminated by nuclear testing. The ship and its crew helped move an entire community to safety, a vivid example of solidarity in the face of nuclear harm.

The Rainbow Warrior also sailed to protest ongoing nuclear tests in the Pacific. In 1985, the ship was bombed by French agents in Auckland harbour, an attack that killed photographer Fernando Pereira. Steve survived the bombing, emerging from that trauma with his commitment to non-violent environmental action intact and, if anything, strengthened.

After his years at Greenpeace International, Steve brought the same determination to accelerating the clean energy transition. As General Secretary of the Global Wind Energy Council, he helped guide the wind industry through a period of explosive growth. During his time there, global installed wind power capacity rose from 74 gigawatts to 539 gigawatts, a transformation that pushed wind energy from the margins toward the center of the world’s power systems.

Behind the public achievements was a person whose love of nature ran deep and personal. Steve was known not only for his strategic mind and steady leadership, but also for his passions beyond campaigning. He loved sailing, a way of life that kept him close to the sea he had spent so much of his life defending. He also played blues guitar, a quieter expression of the creativity and soul that fueled his work.

Steve Sawyer is remembered for his courage, his clear-eyed leadership in the face of immense global challenges, and his belief that determined people can change the course of history. His legacy lives on in the treaties that protect the atmosphere and the oceans, in the communities made safer from nuclear harm, and in the wind turbines now turning across the world—symbols of a cleaner, more hopeful future he helped bring within reach.
