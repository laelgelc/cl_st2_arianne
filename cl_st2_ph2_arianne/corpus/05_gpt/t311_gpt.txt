Indigenous Land Defenders in the Amazon are risking their lives to protect some of the world’s most vital ecosystems, even as threats to their safety grow more severe.

In Brazil’s Amazon, the Munduruku people are facing escalating violence linked to illegal gold mining. On May 26, illegal miners attacked a Munduruku village with gunfire and arson, setting homes ablaze and burning the house of Indigenous leader Maria Leusa. This attack did not happen in isolation. It follows a pattern of intimidation and brutality, including the destruction of the headquarters of an Indigenous women’s association in March and attacks on the Yanomami people.

These assaults are happening in a political context where illegal miners have been emboldened by the administration of President Jair Bolsonaro, whose policies and rhetoric have undermined Indigenous rights and environmental protections. As miners push deeper into Indigenous territories in search of profit, communities are left to confront armed invasions, fires, and the constant threat of displacement and death.

The environmental damage is already immense. Between 2008 and 2020, illegal mining destroyed more than 61 square kilometres of Munduruku land. Alarmingly, 63% of this destruction occurred in just two years, from 2019 to 2020, highlighting how rapidly the situation is deteriorating.

Indigenous peoples are on the frontlines of the climate and biodiversity crises, defending forests, rivers, and lands that are critical for the health of the planet. Their struggle is not only for their homes and cultures, but for the future of the Amazon and the global climate.

Greenpeace stands in solidarity with Indigenous communities in Brazil and around the world, supporting their rights and demanding an end to profit-driven destruction. Protecting Indigenous territories and respecting the leadership of Indigenous land defenders are essential steps toward safeguarding the Amazon and confronting the intertwined crises of climate breakdown and ecosystem collapse.
