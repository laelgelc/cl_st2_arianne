Taiwan’s rise as a global seafood powerhouse has come at a devastating human and environmental cost. A new Greenpeace East Asia report reveals that Fong Chun Formosa (FCF) – one of the world’s largest tuna traders, with annual revenue of around US$45 billion – is linked to forced labor of migrant workers, illegal fishing, shark finning, and transshipment at sea.

At the heart of this crisis is Taiwan’s two-tiered labor system, which excludes many Southeast Asian migrant fishers from basic protections. This system creates a legal and regulatory gap that allows exploitation to flourish: the people who spend months or years at sea catching tuna and other high-value species are often those with the fewest rights, the weakest protections, and the least access to justice.

The report highlights how these structural inequalities intersect with destructive fishing practices. Transshipment at sea – where catch is transferred from one vessel to another without returning to port – makes it easier to hide labor abuses and illegal activities. On vessels linked to FCF’s supply chain, this has been associated with forced labor conditions, illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing, and shark finning.

To break this cycle of abuse, Taiwan must urgently reform its laws and enforcement practices. Abolishing the two-tiered labor system is a critical first step, so that all fishers, regardless of nationality, are entitled to the same protections. Taiwan should adopt core International Labour Organization (ILO) conventions relevant to fishers’ rights and ensure that these standards are fully implemented at sea, not just on paper.

Strengthening inspections is equally vital. Authorities need the capacity and mandate to carry out robust, regular checks on vessels, including those operating far from shore. Effective, accessible grievance mechanisms must be created so that migrant workers can report abuses safely and seek redress without fear of retaliation or deportation.

As a dominant player in the global tuna trade, FCF has a responsibility to act. The company must disclose its full list of suppliers so that its supply chain can be independently scrutinized. It should immediately end transshipment at sea in its supply chains, a practice that undermines transparency and enables abuse.

FCF also needs to ensure credible, continuous monitoring of working conditions and environmental practices on vessels linked to its business, and upgrade its human rights policies so they align with international standards and are enforceable in practice. Paper commitments are not enough; there must be clear expectations, oversight, and consequences for violations throughout the supply chain.

Consumers have a role to play too. Reducing overall seafood consumption can help shrink demand that currently fuels abusive, high-risk fishing operations. When people do choose to eat seafood, supporting local fisheries with better traceability and closer community oversight can help shift the market away from opaque, industrial supply chains that too often rely on exploited labor and destructive practices.

The abuses documented in the Greenpeace East Asia report are not inevitable features of the seafood industry; they are the result of policy choices, corporate decisions, and a lack of transparency. By reforming laws, demanding accountability from companies like FCF, and changing consumption patterns, it is possible to protect both ocean ecosystems and the people whose labor brings seafood to our plates.
