The past year’s fires and storms have made the abstract idea of “global warming” feel brutally real. What was once discussed in charts, scenarios, and degrees Celsius has erupted into walls of flame and swirling columns of water and wind that people can see, breathe, and flee from. For many, this may be the moment when climate change stopped being a distant concern and became an undeniable, lived experience.

Across huge swathes of the planet, record-breaking wildfires have torn through landscapes that were already parched by intense heat waves and prolonged droughts. In Russia, China, and Mongolia, fires have raged over vast areas, fueled by hot, dry conditions that left forests and grasslands tinder-dry. North America has seen some of its most destructive fire seasons, with flames consuming homes and communities, forcing mass evacuations, and leaving behind charred towns and toxic smoke. Europe, too, has watched hillsides, forests, and rural areas burn in ways that once seemed exceptional but are now starting to feel like a new, dangerous pattern.

These fires are not isolated accidents. They are being supercharged by a hotter climate. As temperatures rise, heat waves become more intense and droughts more severe, drying out vegetation and soils. When ignition comes—from lightning, human activity, or infrastructure failures—fires spread faster, burn hotter, and are far harder to control. The result has been widespread destruction of homes and habitats, the loss of lives, and hundreds of thousands of people living under evacuation orders or choking smoke.

At the same time, the world’s oceans, warmed by accumulating greenhouse gases, have been feeding unprecedented storms. Warmer waters act as high-octane fuel for hurricanes and tropical storms, helping them grow more powerful and hold more moisture. In 2017, this helped drive a series of devastating storms that rewrote record books.

Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria pounded the Americas in rapid succession. Harvey unleashed extraordinary rainfall and flooding, Irma maintained ferocious strength over unusually warm waters, and Maria brought catastrophic damage to communities in its path. Together, they delivered record-breaking energy and destruction, and they left a trail of shattered infrastructure, displaced families, and long, painful recoveries. In Europe, Ophelia—also intensified by warmer seas—brought its own set of records and impacts, a stark reminder that the North Atlantic is not immune to the new extremes of a heating world.

What is especially alarming is that these impacts do not rise in a simple, linear way with temperature. The relationship between a warmer world and extreme events is non-linear: as global temperatures climb, the risks and damages can escalate much faster than the thermometer suggests. A few tenths of a degree can mean a sharp increase in the likelihood of deadly heat waves, mega-fires, and storms that overwhelm defenses and emergency systems. The fires and storms of 2017 hint at how quickly the situation can worsen as we continue to heat the planet.

This is happening against a backdrop of decades of climate science warnings that went largely unheeded. Scientists have been clear about the dangers of rising emissions and the need to act, but political and economic systems repeatedly failed to respond at the scale and speed required. Emissions kept climbing, and the window to avoid the most dangerous outcomes has narrowed.

Yet the same moment that exposes the failures of the past also sharpens the need for rapid, transformative change. The blog post points to “seven megatrends” as pathways for action—major shifts that can drive down emissions and build resilience. While the details of these megatrends are not laid out in the summary, their purpose is clear: to channel the urgency we now feel into concrete, systemic changes.

The fires and storms of 2017 are not just disasters; they are signals. They show us what a hotter world looks like and warn of how much worse it can become if temperatures continue to rise. They also underline that we still have choices. The scale of destruction we witnessed is not a fixed future; it depends on how quickly and decisively we act to reduce emissions and to reshape the systems that are driving this crisis.

The visceral shock of seeing cities flooded, forests turned to ash, and whole regions battered by record-breaking storms may, in time, be remembered as a turning point in public awareness. Whether it also becomes a turning point in action depends on what we do now, while the smoke still hangs in the air and the memory of these extremes remains impossible to ignore.
