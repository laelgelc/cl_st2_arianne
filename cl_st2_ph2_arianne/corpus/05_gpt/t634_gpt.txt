A hidden camera in a Polish slaughterhouse has revealed scenes that are difficult to watch and even harder to accept: cows so sick they could barely stand being dragged to slaughter, in clear pain, and their meat sent into the food chain without basic veterinary checks. That meat was then exported to 14 European countries and even ended up in school canteens.

This is not an isolated incident. It is a stark reminder of the ongoing problems in industrial meat production. When profit is put above health, animal welfare and the environment, corners get cut. We have seen this before with scandals like mad cow disease and listeria. The pattern is always the same: weak oversight and a system that treats animals as units on a production line rather than living beings.

In Poland, a worryingly high percentage of diseased livestock is still approved for human consumption. That means meat from animals that should never enter the food chain is ending up on people’s plates. It is a direct threat to public health and a clear sign that the system is not working.

The impacts go far beyond what happens inside slaughterhouses. Industrial meat production is a major driver of deforestation, pollution and the climate crisis. Forests are cleared to grow feed and to make space for grazing. Water, air and soil are polluted by waste from intensive farms. Greenhouse gas emissions from livestock and feed production are helping to heat the planet.

This scandal is a symptom of a deeper problem: a food system built on intensive animal farming, weak regulation and a lack of transparency. To protect people, animals and the planet, we need stronger rules, better enforcement and full traceability of where our food comes from and how it is produced.

But it is not only about regulation. It is also about changing what is on our plates. Shifting towards more plant-based diets reduces pressure on forests, cuts pollution and lowers climate emissions. It also weakens the demand that keeps industrial meat production in place.

Everyone can play a role in this change. Parents, teachers and students can push for eco-friendly, plant-based options in school canteens, helping ensure that what children eat is better for their health and for the planet. At home, trying more plant-based meals is easier when you have inspiration and practical ideas. The Greenpeace Cookbook is one tool people can use to explore tasty, plant-based recipes and make everyday choices that support a fairer, safer and greener food system.
