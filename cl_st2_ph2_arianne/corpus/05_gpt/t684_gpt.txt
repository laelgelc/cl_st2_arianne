Every year on 26 September, the UN International Day for the Total Elimination of Nuclear Weapons is a stark reminder that the most destructive weapons ever created still exist, still threaten life on Earth, and still absorb vast public resources that are desperately needed elsewhere.

In 2017, a powerful counterweight to this reality was born. That year, 122 states adopted the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW) at the United Nations. The treaty aims to place nuclear weapons in the same legal category as biological and chemical weapons, which are already prohibited under international law. It is a clear statement that nuclear weapons are unacceptable, not only morally but legally.

The TPNW will enter into force once 50 states have ratified it. At present, 15 states have ratified and 60 have signed. Each new signature and ratification brings the world closer to a formal, comprehensive ban on nuclear weapons. Yet, the states that possess nuclear weapons—and many of their allies—have boycotted the treaty process, refusing to participate in negotiations or sign the agreement. This boycott stands in sharp contrast to the growing global pressure to eliminate these weapons, reflected in the strong support the treaty has already received.

The urgency behind this effort is rooted in history and in human suffering. The devastation of Hiroshima remains one of the clearest examples of what nuclear weapons do in practice: they obliterate cities, annihilate lives in an instant, and leave survivors to endure radiation sickness, cancers, and trauma for decades. Nuclear weapons are inherently indiscriminate. They cannot distinguish between soldiers and civilians, between combatants and children. Their use would violate basic principles of humanitarian law and human rights.

In today’s world, nuclear weapons are also obsolete in the face of modern threats. They cannot address the climate crisis, pandemics, poverty, or cyberattacks. They do nothing to advance genuine human security. Yet governments continue to pour enormous sums into maintaining and modernising nuclear arsenals. While the total number of nuclear weapons in the world has fallen since the Cold War, spending on them is rising. Resources that could strengthen health systems, education, climate resilience, and social protection are instead diverted into weapons that, if used, would cause catastrophic humanitarian and environmental damage.

This contradiction is particularly stark when measured against commitments already made. In 1970, the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) entered into force, establishing a bargain: non-nuclear-weapon states agreed not to acquire nuclear weapons, and nuclear-weapon states committed to pursue disarmament. Decades later, that promise remains unfulfilled. Nuclear-armed states still possess thousands of warheads and are investing in keeping them operational for generations to come. At the same time, the risk of proliferation persists, as more actors seek to acquire or develop nuclear capabilities.

The TPNW is a response to this decades-long failure. It reinforces the demand that nuclear weapons be treated like other weapons of mass destruction—banned, delegitimised, and ultimately dismantled. It reflects the determination of the majority of the world’s countries not to be held hostage by the doctrines and arsenals of a few.

Marking the International Day for the Total Elimination of Nuclear Weapons means recognising that real security cannot be built on the threat of mass destruction. It means insisting that public funds be redirected from nuclear weapons to human security: healthcare, education, climate action, and peacebuilding. It means demanding that governments honour their obligations, end nuclear proliferation, and take concrete steps towards a world free of nuclear weapons.

The choice is clear: continue to invest in weapons that endanger everyone, or invest in people and the planet. The Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons offers a path forward. It is up to governments—and the global public holding them to account—to ensure that path is followed.
