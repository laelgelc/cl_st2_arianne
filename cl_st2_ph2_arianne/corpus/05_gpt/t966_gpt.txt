Greenpeace is celebrating a major win: LEGO has decided to end its contract with Shell following a three-month campaign backed by more than a million people around the world. Those supporters took action by emailing LEGO and calling on the company to cut its ties with Shell, a corporation pushing ahead with controversial plans for Arctic drilling.

This decision deals a blow to Shell’s attempt to use partnerships with much‑loved, family-friendly brands to polish its public image. As opposition to Arctic drilling grows, Shell has tried to associate itself with companies that parents and children trust. LEGO’s move shows that public pressure can make those partnerships too costly for brands that want to be seen as responsible.

The campaign that led to this moment was powered by creativity and people of all ages. A central turning point was a viral video that was watched nearly six million times. It helped expose how Shell was using LEGO’s positive reputation to distract from its drilling ambitions in one of the world’s most fragile regions.

Children were at the heart of the campaign. In London, young people built Arctic animals out of LEGO bricks and brought them to Shell’s headquarters, turning a children’s toy into a powerful symbol of what’s at stake in the Arctic. Across the world, miniature LEGO figures took part in “LEGOlution” protests, popping up in imaginative displays that called out Shell’s plans. At Legoland, activists staged a daring action in which a LEGO climber appeared at a Shell-branded petrol station, underlining the clash between a playful family attraction and a company drilling in the Arctic.

All of this added up to a huge public outcry that LEGO could not ignore. By choosing not to renew its contract with Shell, LEGO has shown that companies do not have to help fossil fuel corporations clean up their image.

This campaign victory comes at a time when Arctic sea ice is at record lows, underlining how rapidly the region is changing. Greenpeace is urging Shell to go further than losing a marketing partner: Shell must abandon its Arctic drilling plans altogether. Public pressure has already helped push one of the world’s most famous toy companies to walk away. Now that same pressure is needed to protect the Arctic itself.
