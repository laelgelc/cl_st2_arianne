Under the cover of darkness in the Indian Ocean, Greenpeace activists aboard the Esperanza confronted the Explorer II, a vessel deeply embedded in Thai Union’s global tuna supply chain. For weeks, the crew of the Esperanza had been tracking and dismantling destructive fishing gear, and the Explorer II was a stark example of why that work is urgently needed.

The Explorer II operates by anchoring at sea and using around 80 high-powered lights to attract marine life. Once drawn in, fish are then scooped up by industrial fishing vessels using nets that take almost everything in their path. This method doesn’t discriminate: it lures and captures a wide range of species, contributing to the overfishing crisis that is pushing ocean ecosystems to the brink and undermining the livelihoods of coastal communities who depend on healthy seas.

Owned by the Albacora Group, the Explorer II is part of the supply chain for major brands, including John West. That means the seafood ending up on supermarket shelves is directly linked to practices that damage marine life and threaten the long-term health of our oceans.

When Greenpeace activists reached the Explorer II at the Coco de Mer seamount, they took direct action. Using eco-friendly paint, they blacked out the ship’s 80 powerful lights, disrupting its ability to lure marine life. Rather than engage, the vessel fled the seamount, but the Esperanza pursued, determined to keep the spotlight on destructive fishing practices that companies would rather keep hidden far from public view.

This confrontation is part of a broader effort. For weeks, activists have been removing similar destructive gear from the ocean, exposing how industrial fishing operations rely on tools designed to maximize short-term catch at the expense of long-term sustainability. These actions are not isolated stunts; they are a response to a global crisis that has already been recognized by international decision-makers.

At a recent summit, governments agreed to ban the use of such powerful lights, acknowledging the severe impact of overfishing on marine ecosystems and on the communities whose food security and livelihoods depend on healthy fish populations. That decision marks an important step, but rules on paper are not enough. The Explorer II and other vessels like it show how much work remains to turn commitments into real change at sea.

The damage caused by overfishing is not abstract. When vessels use indiscriminate methods to haul in vast quantities of marine life, they strip the ocean of fish faster than populations can recover. This undermines the balance of marine ecosystems and erodes the foundation of coastal economies around the world. Communities that have fished sustainably for generations are left competing with industrial fleets that treat the ocean as a limitless resource.

The action against the Explorer II is a call to strengthen and enforce bans on destructive fishing methods and to hold powerful seafood companies accountable for what happens in their supply chains. It is also an invitation for people everywhere to be part of a growing movement demanding that the ocean is treated as a living system, not a mine to be emptied.

The summit’s ban on these lights shows that change is possible when pressure builds and the evidence of harm can no longer be ignored. But it will take sustained public engagement to ensure that commitments are enforced on the water, that destructive gear is removed for good, and that companies like those supplied by the Albacora Group and Thai Union are pushed to clean up their operations.

The Esperanza’s pursuit of the Explorer II is a reminder that the frontlines of ocean protection are often hundreds of miles from land, in places most people will never see. Yet what happens there affects us all. Each destructive light turned off, each piece of harmful gear removed, brings us one step closer to oceans that can sustain both marine life and human communities for generations to come.

This is the moment to turn outrage into action, and concern into a powerful, global demand for change in how we fish and how we value our seas.
