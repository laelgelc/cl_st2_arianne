Stretching 8,100 kilometres along Australia’s southern coastline, the Great Southern Reef is one of the country’s most remarkable – and least known – marine ecosystems. Beneath the surface, vast seaweed forests create an underwater world that is both highly productive and uniquely Australian.

These seaweed forests capture carbon and provide food and shelter for hundreds of species. An incredible 85% of the species found here are endemic, meaning they exist nowhere else on Earth. This rich habitat even attracts visitors from the icy south: Antarctic whales migrate through these waters, relying on the reef’s productivity and biodiversity.

Despite its importance, large parts of the Great Southern Reef remain largely unexplored. Harsh ocean conditions have made research and exploration difficult, leaving many of its secrets hidden. That’s beginning to change. Greenpeace’s iconic ship, the Rainbow Warrior, has been undertaking surveys along this coastline, shining a light on what’s at stake.

These expeditions have included first-time dives off Kangaroo Island, revealing more of the reef’s thriving – and fragile – marine life. They build on a major scientific study in the Great Australian Bight that identified 400 new marine species, underscoring just how little we still know about these southern seas, and how much there is to protect.

Yet this extraordinary ecosystem faces serious threats from the oil industry. Proposals for oil drilling in these waters bring with them the risk of spills that could devastate marine life, local industries, and coastal communities. A major spill would spread far beyond a single drilling site, smothering seaweed forests, harming wildlife, and disrupting the livelihoods that depend on a healthy ocean.

On top of the immediate danger of spills, burning more oil drives climate change, heating and acidifying the oceans that life in the Great Southern Reef depends on. This is happening at a time when renewable energy alternatives are rapidly expanding and becoming more affordable. Clinging to oil is not only dangerous – it is outdated.

Protecting the Great Southern Reef means choosing a different path. It means valuing living seas and thriving coastal communities over short-term fossil fuel profits. It means recognising that this reef, with its carbon-storing seaweed forests and extraordinary endemic species, is a natural treasure that cannot be replaced.

You can help by spreading the word. Share what you’ve learned about the Great Southern Reef and why it matters. Talk to friends, family, and colleagues about the risks of oil drilling in these waters and the urgent need to protect them. Add your voice to the growing call urging the Australian Government to safeguard this unique marine ecosystem from fossil fuel expansion.

The more people know about the Great Southern Reef, the harder it will be to ignore.
