Ten years ago, Greenpeace investigations pulled back the curtain on how some of the world’s biggest brands were getting their palm oil. Behind familiar logos and everyday products lay a supply chain driving the destruction of Indonesia’s rainforests and threatening the lives and livelihoods of people, tigers, and orangutans.

Public outrage forced change. In 2013, major traders like Wilmar – the world’s largest palm oil trader – began adopting “No Deforestation, No Peat, No Exploitation” (NDPE) policies. By 2014, most big traders had followed. On paper, this looked like a turning point: powerful companies committing to keep destruction out of their palm oil.

But recent investigations show that promise has not been fulfilled.

Today, palm oil traders still cannot prove that their supply chains are free from deforestation and abuse. Instead of tracing problems to their source and cutting off destructive suppliers, many operate with a “don’t ask, don’t tell” mindset. As long as there is no hard proof of wrongdoing in front of them, they continue business as usual. This wilful blindness has real, devastating consequences.

Indonesia’s forests have continued to fall at a massive scale. As habitat disappears, orangutan populations are pushed into ever smaller fragments of forest, making it harder for them to find food, mates, and safe places to live. Their numbers are declining, and every new clearing, road, or plantation makes survival more difficult.

The destruction doesn’t just affect wildlife. Fires used to clear land for plantations have helped fuel deadly haze, choking communities across Indonesia and beyond. People are forced to breathe toxic air, schools close, and daily life is disrupted. At the same time, human rights abuses linked to plantation expansion and operations continue, with local communities paying the price for a system that still prioritises cheap palm oil over human dignity and safety.

Despite years of pledges and policies, this is what NDPE too often looks like in practice: words on paper, while forests burn and communities suffer.

Major consumer brands like PepsiCo and Unilever sit at the end of this chain. They sell products that contain palm oil, but they still do not fully disclose where that palm oil comes from. Without full transparency, it is impossible for the public to know whether their products are linked to forest destruction, fires, and abuse. These companies must open up their supply chains, publish where their palm oil is sourced, and cut ties with suppliers that continue to destroy forests or violate human rights.

Amid this bleak picture, there is a reason for hope: the discovery of a new Sumatran orangutan species. This remarkable great ape is a powerful reminder of how much we still have to learn about the forests of Indonesia, and how much there is left to protect. But that hope is fragile. The same destructive forces that have driven other orangutan populations into decline now threaten the habitat of this newly identified species as well.

Ten years on from the first big palm oil exposés, the lesson is clear. Commitments on paper are not enough. To protect Indonesia’s rainforests, safeguard orangutans and other wildlife, prevent deadly haze, and uphold human rights, brands and traders must move beyond “don’t ask, don’t tell” and take real responsibility for their supply chains. That means full transparency, genuine monitoring, and the courage to walk away from suppliers that refuse to change.
