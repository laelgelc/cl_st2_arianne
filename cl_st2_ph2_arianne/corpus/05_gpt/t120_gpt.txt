Across the world, generations have grown up with reuse and refill systems as a normal, everyday part of life. Long before supermarket aisles were packed with disposable plastic packaging, people were already sharing, refilling, returning, and repairing. What has changed is not human behavior or needs, but the rise of a throwaway culture driven by corporate decisions.

Since the 1960s, brands like Nestlé, Unilever, Coca-Cola, and PepsiCo have aggressively pushed single-use plastics into markets everywhere, replacing traditional, low-waste systems with products designed to be used once and discarded. This shift has been fueled by corporate greed and a business model that treats our communities, air, land, and oceans as dumping grounds for packaging waste. The result is a global plastic crisis that communities—especially in the Global South—are forced to live with every day.

Yet the story of reuse is not one of the past. Around the world, people and movements are proving that reuse and refill are not only possible, but already thriving.

In India, the Dabbawalla system shows how efficient, low-waste logistics can work at massive scale. For decades, workers have relied on tiffin carriers—reusable metal lunchboxes—delivered and returned daily, demonstrating a living example of a circular system. Traditional thali meals, served on reusable plates and often shared in communal settings, reflect a cultural norm where reusables are at the heart of how people eat and share food.

Across many African countries, governments and communities are taking decisive steps to move away from single-use items, including bans on certain disposable products. These are not just policies on paper; they are part of a broader effort to protect local environments, public health, and livelihoods from the impacts of plastic pollution.

In Latin America, countries are also showing what systemic change can look like. Chile has introduced mandates for refillable bottles, requiring companies to offer and support reuse instead of relying solely on single-use packaging. In Brazil, returnable bottles have seen strong success, proving that when reuse systems are supported by regulation and infrastructure, they can become a mainstream, convenient choice.

In the Philippines, communities are building a powerful Zero Waste movement that challenges the dominance of single-use plastics. Wala-Usik stores—designed to eliminate waste—offer products without disposable packaging, allowing customers to refill containers and buy only what they need. These are real, working alternatives that prioritize people and the planet over corporate profit.

These examples show that the solutions to the plastic crisis are not hypothetical or futuristic. They already exist, led by communities, innovators, and policymakers—especially in the Global South—who are reimagining how we access products without being locked into a throwaway system.

Individual choices to reuse and refill matter, but they are not enough on their own. The scale of the problem demands systemic change. Corporations that have profited for decades from single-use plastics must be held accountable and required to shift their business models toward reuse. This means investing in refill and return systems, supporting regulations that prioritize reusables, and ending the relentless expansion of single-use packaging.

A reuse revolution is not only necessary; it is already underway. Around the world, there is a growing database of initiatives that document and celebrate these efforts—from community refill shops and delivery systems to large-scale returnable packaging schemes. These stories offer a blueprint for a future where reuse is the norm, not the exception.

The path forward is clear: support and scale up the reuse and refill systems that people have relied on for generations, and demand that the corporations responsible for the plastic crisis change course. By learning from and amplifying the leadership of Global South communities, we can build systems that work for people and the planet, and finally move beyond the era of throwaway plastics.
