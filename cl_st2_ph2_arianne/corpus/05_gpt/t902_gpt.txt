The first thing that strikes you underwater in the North Sea is how alive it is. Annet van Aarsen describes slipping beneath the surface into unexpectedly clear water, where wrecks loom out of the blue like underwater cities. Their metal ribs and decks are covered in colourful anemones, while fish weave between the structures. Crabs scuttle over the hulls, lobsters peer from crevices, and delicate nudibranchs and tube worms add flashes of colour and movement. Far from being lifeless or grey, these wrecks are vibrant reefs, supporting a rich and fragile ecosystem.

Annet has been diving since 2001 and made her first North Sea dive in 2002. Over the years, she has watched this underwater world change. Cod that were once a familiar sight have largely vanished from places where she used to encounter them. At the same time, she has seen more and more ghost nets: fishing gear lost or abandoned at sea that continues to trap marine life long after it has been discarded.

These ghost nets cling to wrecks and reefs, forming deadly curtains. Fish, crabs, lobsters and other animals become entangled and die, only to attract more scavengers that in turn get trapped. The wrecks that host so much life are also being turned into snares by this persistent, invisible pollution.

In 2009, confronted with these changes, Annet began volunteering on underwater cleanups and documenting what she saw to raise awareness. Her work underwater became not just about exploring, but about revealing the hidden damage and helping to restore what could be saved. In 2012, she joined the Ghost Fishing Foundation, a group dedicated to finding and removing lost fishing gear from the seabed.

Today, Annet is aboard Greenpeace’s ship Arctic Sunrise, working with eight other divers to remove ghost nets from wrecks in the Sylter Aussenriff area of the North Sea. Together, the nine divers are carefully cutting nets free from the wrecks and bringing them to the surface. Each net removed means fewer animals trapped and a better chance for the wrecks to remain thriving oases of marine life.

Their work is also a powerful reminder that places like Sylter Aussenriff need real protection. The same wrecks that harbour anemones, fish, crabs, lobsters, nudibranchs and tube worms are also bearing the scars of human activity. By showing both the beauty of this underwater world and its vulnerability, Annet and her fellow divers are making visible what is usually out of sight, and underlining why these ecosystems must be safeguarded.
