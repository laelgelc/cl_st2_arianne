In Kangiqtugaapik, also known as Clyde River, life is shaped by isolation, the Arctic environment, and a deep relationship with the sea. This Canadian Arctic town of about 1,000 people depends on the ocean and its wildlife in a way that’s both practical and cultural. Hunting marine animals like narwhals, bowhead whales, and seals is not only a tradition but a necessity. With store prices extremely high, these animals provide essential food that many families simply could not do without.

For generations, Inuit in Kangiqtugaapik have lived in close connection with the land and sea. Their knowledge of the ice, currents, and animal migrations has been passed down over thousands of years. Hunting is central to identity, community, and survival. It shapes how people share, celebrate, and care for one another. It is also a sustainable way of life rooted in respect for the animals and the environment.

Today, that way of life faces a serious threat. Energy companies are planning seismic blasting in the waters around Kangiqtugaapik. Seismic blasting involves powerful underwater explosions to search for oil and gas. These blasts can endanger marine animals like narwhals, bowheads, and seals—species that the community depends on for food and that are at the heart of Inuit culture.

For people in Kangiqtugaapik, this isn’t an abstract environmental issue. If the animals are driven away or harmed, it strikes directly at food security, health, and cultural survival. When the sea is disrupted, the whole community feels it.

This is happening in a place where Inuit have already endured a long history of oppression and attempts to undermine their ways of life. Yet the people of Kangiqtugaapik remain resilient. They are organizing, speaking out, and asserting their rights to protect their waters and their future.

They are calling on others to stand with them and help stop the seismic blasting. Supporting their efforts means backing a community that is defending not only its food and traditions, but also a sustainable relationship with the Arctic environment that has endured for thousands of years.
