Sharks have been cruising our oceans for more than 400 million years. They survived five mass extinctions that wiped out countless other species, adapting and evolving into the incredible diversity we see today. Some of the most surprising shark discoveries are still happening right now—like the tiny American Pocket Shark, which can secrete a glow‑in‑the‑dark liquid from a small pocket near its front fins. Even after hundreds of millions of years, sharks are still revealing new secrets.

But while sharks have survived planetary upheavals, they are now under intense pressure from human activity. Around the world, sharks are frequently caught as bycatch—unintended victims in commercial fishing operations targeting other species. Instead of remaining in the ocean to keep ecosystems healthy, many of these sharks end up in a global trade worth around $1 billion.

In the North Atlantic, for example, mako sharks have been caught in excessive numbers. These fast, powerful predators are among the many shark species whose populations are struggling to cope with industrial fishing. Yet they continue to be pulled from the water, processed, and traded across international markets.

Shark products show up in places many people would never suspect. Squalene, an oil derived from shark livers, is used in a wide array of products, from dietary supplements to cosmetics and even pet food. Every capsule, cream, or treat that relies on shark‑derived squalene represents more pressure on already stressed shark populations.

Despite their ancient resilience, sharks cannot withstand unlimited exploitation. They need safe spaces at sea where they are not constantly at risk of being caught and traded. Right now, only about 1% of the world’s oceans are properly protected. That leaves the vast majority of the high seas—areas beyond national borders—open to intense and often poorly regulated fishing.

A strong global oceans treaty is essential to change this. By creating and enforcing protections on the high seas, such a treaty could give shark populations room to recover and help restore balance to marine ecosystems. As we celebrate Shark Week and marvel at everything from massive apex predators to tiny glowing pocket sharks, it’s also a moment to recognize how urgently they need protection. Safeguarding sharks means safeguarding the health of the oceans they have called home for hundreds of millions of years.
