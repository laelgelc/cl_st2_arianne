Transport emissions are rising fast, and the cars we drive are a big part of the problem. Since 1990, transport emissions have grown by 25% in Europe and a staggering 74% globally. Road transport alone is responsible for around 70% of these emissions. Every additional year we tolerate polluting internal combustion engine (ICE) cars on our streets, we lock in more climate damage and put more people’s health at risk.

Greenpeace is tracking how the world is responding with a global map of phase-out dates for petrol and diesel cars. This tool shows which governments and cities are taking action, and which are lagging behind. It’s designed to spark a race to the top: a competition between cities and countries to become cleaner, faster. When people can see where their own city stands, it becomes much easier to demand that local leaders move up the ranking by committing to earlier phase-out dates and stricter rules on polluting vehicles.

Banning ICE cars is not just a climate necessity; it’s a public health imperative. The toxic exhaust from petrol and diesel engines contributes to lung cancer, asthma, and heart disease, and the health risks from this pollution are worse than those from smoking. Every day that high-polluting vehicles remain the default option, millions of people—especially children, older people, and those living near busy roads—are forced to breathe air that harms their bodies.

Phasing out ICE cars and restricting them from our streets can cut emissions and dramatically reduce these health risks. But getting rid of polluting cars is only half the story. We need to replace them with systems that truly put people first. That means streets designed for walking and cycling, where moving around without a car is safe, convenient, and pleasant. It means public transport powered by renewable energy, so buses, trams, and trains become clean, reliable backbones of everyday life. It also means shared electric vehicles that are available when needed, without everyone having to own a private car.

This transformation won’t happen on its own. Citizens have a crucial role to play in pushing representatives to adopt ambitious phase-out dates, introduce restrictions on ICE vehicles, and be held accountable for delivering cleaner air and safer streets. By using tools like the Greenpeace phase-out map, people can see who is leading, who is lagging, and where pressure is needed most.

Abolishing polluting ICE cars is about more than technology; it’s about redesigning our cities around people instead of exhaust pipes. Clean air, quieter streets, safer journeys, and a stable climate are all within reach—if we choose to leave petrol and diesel cars behind and build a future where walking, cycling, renewable-powered public transport, and shared electric vehicles are the norm.
