Across Europe, Greenpeace organizations are mobilizing in response to the war in Ukraine and the fastest-growing refugee crisis since World War II. In neighboring countries such as Slovakia and Romania, Greenpeace staff and volunteers are supporting people fleeing the violence with supplies, tents, food, and other essential aid. This immediate, practical solidarity is helping refugees find safety and dignity as they cross borders in search of shelter.

At the same time, the crisis is exposing how deeply war and fossil fuel dependence are intertwined. The conflict is closely linked to the global energy system’s reliance on oil and gas, and it is a stark reminder that fossil fuels do not only drive climate breakdown – they also fuel geopolitical tensions, instability, and violence. As long as economies remain locked into coal, oil, and gas, leaders will continue to make decisions constrained by access to these resources and the power they confer.

That is why Greenpeace is calling for a rapid transition away from fossil fuels and towards renewable energy systems that are cleaner, fairer, and more resilient. Moving to renewables is not only a climate necessity; it is a pathway to greater peace and security. Energy systems built on wind, sun, and efficiency can reduce the leverage of fossil fuel exporters and help prevent future crises driven by resource dependency.

Across the continent, activists are taking a clear stand against both the war and the fossil fuel flows that help sustain it. In Germany, Spain, France, and other countries, Greenpeace activists have carried out non-violent protests targeting Russian oil and gas imports. These peaceful actions highlight the moral and political urgency of cutting financial lifelines that enable aggression, and they demand that governments stop treating fossil fuel trade as business as usual in the midst of war.

These protests are part of a broader wave of global, peaceful demonstrations opposing the invasion. People around the world are coming together in streets, squares, and online spaces to denounce the violence and to call for peace, solidarity, and justice. This outpouring of non-violent resistance reflects a deep, shared conviction: war and militarism are incompatible with a livable planet.

For more than 50 years, Greenpeace has brought together peace and ecology, confronting nuclear testing, militarism, and environmental destruction as interconnected threats. The current moment continues that legacy. From supporting refugees on the ground, to challenging the fossil fuel system that helps underwrite conflict, to joining global peaceful protests, Greenpeace is acting on a simple but powerful idea: a green and peaceful future must be built together, without war and without fossil fuels.
