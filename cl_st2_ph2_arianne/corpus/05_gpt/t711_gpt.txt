Seven years ago, millions of people around the world joined together to demand that fashion stop poisoning our rivers, workers, and communities. From high streets to social media, from catwalks to factory gates, people raised their voices and pushed some of the world’s biggest clothing brands to change how they do business.

That pressure helped launch Greenpeace’s Detox My Fashion campaign, a global effort to halt toxic chemical pollution from clothing production. At the time, hazardous chemicals were routinely used in dyeing, printing, and treating fabrics, then discharged into waterways near factories. The true cost of cheap clothes was being paid by communities living downstream and by workers exposed daily to dangerous substances.

Public actions and consumer pressure worked. Over the past seven years, 80 companies — together representing about 15% of global clothing production — have committed to eliminate hazardous chemicals from their supply chains by 2020. These commitments and the progress made are documented in Greenpeace’s Destination Zero report.

Major brands such as Zara, adidas, and Tesco have begun to transform how their clothes are made. They are testing factory wastewater to track and reduce pollution, substituting hazardous substances with safer alternatives, and taking steps to improve working conditions in production hubs such as China, Mexico, and Indonesia. This kind of transparent monitoring and chemical phase-out was unthinkable from big fashion just a few years ago.

These changes show that when people demand better, fashion brands can move away from toxic production. Yet the overall system of fast fashion is still driving a different kind of pollution and waste. The rapid churn of cheap, short-lived clothing is fuelling overflowing wardrobes, bulging landfills, and the spread of microplastic fibres into our environment. Even as some chemicals are phased out, the sheer volume of clothing being produced and discarded keeps rising.

To truly detox fashion, we need to change not only how clothes are made, but how many are made — and how we use them. That means buying fewer new items, choosing pieces that last, and keeping clothes in circulation for as long as possible through care, repair, and creativity.

MAKE SMTHNG Week, running from 23 November to 2 December, is an invitation to do exactly that. Across these days, people everywhere are coming together for tutorials, events, and community actions that celebrate making, mending, sharing, and upcycling instead of mindless shopping. It’s a chance to learn how to repair a favourite garment, transform something old into something new, or swap clothes with friends and neighbours.

By buying less and making more of what we already have, we can cut waste, reduce pollution, and challenge the throwaway culture that feeds fast fashion. Every repaired seam, every upcycled shirt, and every shared outfit is a small act of resistance against a toxic, wasteful system — and a step toward a cleaner, fairer fashion industry for workers, communities, and the planet.
