Shell intends to abandon parts of four of its old oil rigs in the North Sea’s Brent Oil Field. Three of these platforms still contain more than 11,000 tonnes of oil. If left in place, this oil will eventually leak into the ocean, polluting the sea and setting a dangerous precedent that other companies could follow.

In October, Greenpeace activists carried out peaceful protests on two of Shell’s platforms, on the 14th and 15th of the month. They hung banners calling on Shell to clean up its mess and stop polluting the oceans. The action was aimed at drawing attention to the long-term threat posed by leaving thousands of tonnes of oil in aging structures on the seabed.

Rather than commit to a full clean-up, Shell has gone to court. The company is seeking an order from a court in Edinburgh that would indefinitely ban protests near its platforms. Shell’s move comes amid concern that sustained public pressure could push governments to rethink their stance on allowing these oil-filled structures to remain in the sea.

Greenpeace is defending the right to peaceful protest in the Scottish court on November 28th. The organisation is calling for public support to help ensure that the demand for a clean ocean and corporate accountability is heard as loudly as possible.
