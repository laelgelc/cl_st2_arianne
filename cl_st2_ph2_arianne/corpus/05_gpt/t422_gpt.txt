The COVID-19 pandemic has reshaped daily life in countless ways, and one of the most visible changes is the widespread use of face masks. While masks are essential for protecting public health, the surge in disposable personal protective equipment (PPE) is creating a new wave of plastic pollution at a time when our planet is already struggling with an overload of waste.

Single-use masks, often made with plastic-based materials, are being discarded in enormous quantities. They are turning up in streets, parks, rivers and oceans, adding to a mounting plastic crisis. This is especially troubling because we are still grappling with the long-term impacts of plastic pollution on ecosystems, wildlife and communities. The pandemic should not become the excuse for another waste emergency.

There is, however, a way to protect both people and the environment. For most of us who are not frontline health or essential workers, reusable masks offer a responsible alternative. These can be washed and worn again and again, significantly reducing the volume of waste generated. They can even be homemade, using materials people already have, which avoids additional strain on supply chains and keeps medical-grade PPE available for those who truly need it.

Choosing a reusable mask is not just a practical decision; it is an ethical one. It is a simple action that acknowledges our responsibility to each other and to the planet. By reducing our reliance on disposable items, we help prevent the pandemic from leaving behind a legacy of plastic waste that will persist long after the virus is under control.

There are powerful lessons to be drawn from places with a long history of mask-wearing. In Japan, for example, masks have been used since the 1918 Flu Pandemic as a common-sense measure to protect others from illness. Over time, wearing a mask became an everyday expression of care for the community. That tradition highlights a crucial point: masks are not only about individual safety, but about collective well-being.

In the context of COVID-19, this idea of altruism can be expanded. Wearing a mask helps safeguard those around us, especially the most vulnerable. Choosing a reusable mask extends that care to the environment, reducing the plastic burden on our shared home. Both actions reflect a commitment to confronting interconnected crises—public health and environmental degradation—together rather than in isolation.

The path forward is clear. We can continue to wear masks to protect one another from the virus, while also being mindful of the materials we choose. By opting for reusable masks whenever possible, except where disposable PPE is genuinely necessary for frontline protection, we help ensure that the fight against COVID-19 does not deepen the plastic pollution crisis.

This moment calls for solidarity on multiple fronts. Each reusable mask worn is a small but meaningful contribution to a healthier society and a more resilient planet. By embracing masks as an act of altruism—for people and for nature—we show that it is possible to respond to one global emergency without worsening another.
