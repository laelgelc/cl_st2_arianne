In Russia’s Amur region, this year’s wildfire season has turned vast stretches of former forest into burning wastelands. Exceptionally low winter snow and strong winds have created ideal conditions for fires to spread rapidly, sparing only the coldest permafrost areas. What was once dense, living forest is now scorched ground, smoke and ash.

The climate stakes are enormous. These wildfires are releasing massive amounts of CO2 into the atmosphere, undermining efforts to meet the Paris Agreement’s goals. On top of greenhouse gases, the fires are spreading soot that can travel long distances and settle on Arctic ice. This dark layer absorbs more sunlight, accelerating ice melt and feeding back into the climate crisis.

Greenpeace is calling for wildfire emissions to be fully recognized in national climate and carbon plans. Ignoring these emissions paints an incomplete—and dangerously optimistic—picture of a country’s real climate impact. Countries with large, fire-prone landscapes, including Russia, need to account for these emissions and take urgent action to prevent and reduce fires.

Most of these fires are not natural disasters in the strict sense—they are driven by human activity. Careless burning, whether for land clearing or waste disposal, is a major cause. That means prevention is both possible and essential. Key measures include public education about fire risks, ensuring people know how to properly extinguish any fire they start, and encouraging immediate reporting of fires before they grow out of control.

In response to the crisis, Greenpeace Russia has launched the Fire initiative. Its goal is to raise awareness about the causes and consequences of wildfires and to help reduce their scale and severity. This work is especially urgent given that wildfires are not confined to Russia: recent years have seen severe fire seasons in Indonesia, the United States, Canada and Brazil, underlining that this is a global emergency.

In the Amur region alone, more than two million hectares have already burned this year, releasing an estimated 110 megatonnes of CO2. The scale of destruction and emissions shows why wildfires must be treated not only as local disasters, but as a central climate issue that demands coordinated, preventive action.
