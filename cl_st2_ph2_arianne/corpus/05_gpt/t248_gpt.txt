Chief Puraka of the Apurinã people, from the Caititu Indigenous Land in the Brazilian Amazon, embodies a way of life rooted in living in harmony with nature. For his community, the forest is not a resource to be exhausted, but the basis of culture, food, water, and spiritual life. Their territory offers a living example of how people and forest can thrive together, even as the surrounding region faces accelerating destruction.

Across the Amazon, this destruction is driven largely by deforestation for agribusiness. This model of production is heavily dependent on water: agribusiness consumes about 70% of the world’s freshwater. By clearing forests and diverting water on such a massive scale, it deepens water crises and fuels extreme weather events. What happens in places like Caititu does not stay local; it is directly linked to droughts, floods, and heatwaves that affect millions of people far beyond the forest.

The prevailing economic logic in the region is based on destruction: cutting down forests, grabbing land, and extracting short-term profit. This destruction-based model hits low-income communities hardest. In states such as Pará, where deforestation has advanced rapidly, many municipalities have some of the lowest Human Development Index (HDI) indicators in the country. The supposed “development” driven by clearing the forest often leaves behind poverty, social conflict, and degraded land.

Current political debates risk making this situation even worse. Pending bills could legalize land invasions and weaken Indigenous rights, effectively rewarding those who grab and destroy forests while undermining those who protect them. For peoples like the Apurinã, whose territories are central to their survival and identity, such measures threaten not only their rights but also the integrity of the forest itself.

Yet there are real, existing alternatives that point to a different future. In many Indigenous and traditional communities, socio-biodiversity chains—like managed fishing and the sustainable harvesting of nuts—are already showing how it is possible to generate income while keeping the forest standing. These activities are based on knowledge of local ecosystems and on using biodiversity without exhausting it.

Agroforestry systems are another powerful alternative. By combining trees, crops, and sometimes animals in the same area, they help revive traditional ways of cultivating the land. Agroforestry can restore degraded areas, improve soil and water conditions, and provide diverse food and income sources. Instead of replacing the forest with monocultures, it works with the forest’s logic of diversity.

Family farming also plays a crucial role in building a more inclusive model of production. Rooted in local communities and often organized through cooperatives, family farmers can supply food in ways that respect ecosystems and support local economies. When combined with forest-friendly practices, family farming becomes a pillar of a just and sustainable rural landscape.

The stakes of these choices go far beyond the boundaries of any single territory. The Amazon’s trees pump enormous amounts of water into the atmosphere through evaporation, helping to regulate rainfall across much of South America. As deforestation advances and this evaporation is reduced, the risk of severe, continental-scale droughts increases. The drying of the Amazon is not only an environmental crisis; it is a direct threat to water security, food production, and the stability of climates across the region.

The path represented by Chief Puraka and the Apurinã people—defending Indigenous rights, keeping forests standing, and valuing socio-biodiversity—is not only about protecting one community or one territory. It points toward a different economic and political choice: one that rejects destruction-based development and embraces forms of production that sustain both people and the planet.
