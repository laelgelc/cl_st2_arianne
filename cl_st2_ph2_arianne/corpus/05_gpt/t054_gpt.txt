As a child growing up in Beijing, Zhao Li’s world was full of small, vivid encounters with nature. She remembers watching cicada nymphs emerge from the soil and hens scratching in courtyards, moments that quietly nurtured a deep curiosity about the living world around her. Those early observations, though ordinary at the time, planted the seeds of a lifelong connection to nature.

That connection took on new meaning when she discovered the work of Jane Goodall. Reading about Goodall’s time with chimpanzees, Zhao Li saw a model of patient observation, respect for other species, and unwavering commitment to the environment. Goodall’s story did more than inspire admiration; it gave Zhao Li a direction. Environmentalism became not just an interest, but an aspiration.

In 2017, this path led her to an internship at Greenpeace East Asia. There, she moved from personal passion to professional action, working as a researcher to support climate campaigns. Her tools were not field notebooks and binoculars, but GIS and satellite data. Through mapping and remote sensing, she contributed to climate work that relies on understanding changes across vast landscapes and long timescales.

This technical work also brought her face-to-face with a difficult reality: widespread public misinformation about climate change. She saw how confusion and misleading narratives slow down the response to a crisis that is already unfolding. For her, this underscored the urgent need to raise awareness and share clear, evidence-based information about what is happening to our planet.

Zhao Li’s awareness of climate impacts is not abstract. Since 2008, she has seen the retreat of glaciers on the Tibetan Plateau, a powerful, visible sign of a warming world. These changes in one of the planet’s most fragile regions are a stark reminder of the scale and seriousness of the climate crisis.

At the same time, Zhao Li reflects on how urban life can obscure our reliance on nature. In cities, it can be easy to forget that our food, water, and air all depend on healthy ecosystems. This disconnection persists even as deforestation and habitat loss accelerate, and as the Amazon—long known as a vital carbon sink—faces such intense degradation that it is becoming a carbon emitter instead.

Confronting these realities can lead to a sense of despair. Zhao Li does not shy away from that feeling, but she refuses to stop there. She returns again to the example of Jane Goodall, drawing strength from Goodall’s persistence and hope in the face of environmental destruction. From that, Zhao Li takes a simple but powerful lesson: even when the outlook is dark, we still have the choice to act.

Her journey—from watching cicadas in Beijing, to being inspired by a pioneering primatologist, to mapping climate impacts via satellite—reflects both the gravity of the crisis and the possibility of response. For Zhao Li, hope is not a passive emotion. It is a decision to keep working, keep informing, and keep defending the natural world that first captured her imagination as a child.
