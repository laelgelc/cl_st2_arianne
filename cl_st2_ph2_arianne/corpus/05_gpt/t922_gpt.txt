In the heart of Italy’s historic textile hub, something quietly revolutionary is happening. In Prato, one of Europe’s most important textile districts, companies that have long supplied fabrics to luxury houses like Gucci, Prada, and Armani are rewriting the rules of fashion production.

Greenpeace is working alongside this district as part of the Detox campaign, and twenty companies have already stepped forward to change how textiles are made. These suppliers are eliminating a range of hazardous chemicals from their production, including PFCs, flame retardants, organotin compounds, and amines from azo dyes that are known to be harmful to human health.

This shift isn’t just about individual factories making isolated improvements. Confindustria Toscana Nord, the regional industry association, is investing in systems to track chemical use, improve transparency, and implement concrete action plans to detox products. By doing so, they are not only changing practices in Prato, but also influencing global supply chains that depend on this district’s textiles.

Prato is setting a new benchmark for the fashion industry, proving that suppliers can move away from dangerous chemicals without waiting for brands to tell them to. This sends a clear challenge to luxury labels and other fashion companies: if their suppliers can commit to Detox, the brands can and must follow.

The goal is clear: more companies pledging to eliminate hazardous chemicals by 2020, and more consumers demanding fashion that doesn’t pollute rivers or poison communities. With each new commitment, the vision of cleaner air, healthier rivers, and safer clothes becomes more tangible.

The choices made in Prato show that a different kind of fashion system is possible—one where style does not come at the expense of people or the planet. Now it’s up to more companies to join the Detox path, and to consumers everywhere to keep asking for truly chemical-free fashion.
