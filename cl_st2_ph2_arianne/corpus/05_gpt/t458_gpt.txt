From Houston’s petrochemical corridor to the overflowing dumpsites of Jakarta and Delhi, The Story of Plastic pulls back the curtain on a crisis that has been carefully disguised as a “litter problem.” This powerful documentary follows global activists who are confronting plastic pollution at every stage of its life cycle, revealing how a material sold to us as convenient and disposable is actually rooted in fossil fuels, toxic emissions, and deep injustice.

Written by Shilpi from Break Free From Plastic, the film challenges two dominant industry narratives: that individual consumers are to blame for the crisis, and that Asia is the primary source of the world’s plastic waste. Instead, it traces plastic back to its origins in oil and gas, showing how production is expanding and driving pollution long before any plastic item reaches a store shelf. In places like Houston, communities living near production facilities bear the brunt of hazardous emissions, with serious consequences for their health and environment.

The Story of Plastic also follows the trail of exported waste, documenting how plastic shipped from wealthier countries ends up in Southeast Asian communities already struggling with inadequate waste management. In Jakarta, Delhi, and beyond, residents are forced to live and work amid mountains of plastic, breathing in fumes from open burning and dealing with contaminated water and soil. The film makes clear that these impacts are not evenly shared: marginalized communities are disproportionately exposed to the worst health and environmental harms.

By connecting plastic to climate change, the documentary underscores that this is not just about trash—it is about a fossil fuel–driven system that threatens our future. Every step in the plastic chain, from extraction to production to disposal, contributes to greenhouse gas emissions and toxic pollution. Rather than accepting industry’s focus on recycling and “better consumer choices,” The Story of Plastic calls for systemic change: cutting plastic production, holding corporations accountable, and centering the voices of those most affected.

There are multiple ways to watch and share this story. The film will be broadcast on the Discovery Channel on Earth Day, April 22, with a digital pre-premiere available on DiscoveryGo starting April 15. It will also be offered as a video-on-demand rental, making it accessible for home viewing. For those who want to bring this conversation to their communities, virtual screenings can be organized through storyofplastic.org, creating space for collective learning and action even when people cannot gather in person.

The Story of Plastic invites viewers to look beyond the convenient myths surrounding plastic and to listen to the communities on the frontlines of production, disposal, and pollution. By amplifying the work of activists from Houston to Jakarta and Delhi, it urges all of us to confront the fossil fuel roots of plastic and to push for the systemic changes needed to protect our climate, our health, and our shared home.
