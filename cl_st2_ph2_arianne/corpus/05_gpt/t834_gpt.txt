Greenpeace’s global forest campaign has one clear objective: to pressure companies to protect the world’s remaining forests. This approach has already helped secure important protections in places like Canada, Brazil, and Indonesia. Now, attention is focused on one of the planet’s great forest systems: the boreal, or Great Northern Forest.

In Russia’s Arkhangelsk region, this forest is under serious threat. Greenpeace’s Great Northern Forest campaign has documented the destruction of Intact Forest Landscapes (IFLs) – large, untouched forest areas that are crucial for biodiversity and climate stability. A recent report reveals that even companies certified by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) have been involved in logging within these IFLs.

The findings have prompted a response from FSC Russia, which recognises that the forestry industry must change. According to FSC Russia, pressure from customers is essential to drive this transformation and to secure lasting protection for key areas like the Dvinsky Forest.

The Dvinsky Forest Reserve is at the heart of this effort. Greenpeace is calling on companies operating in the Arkhangelsk region – including Pomor Timber, Titan, and Arkhangelsk Pulp & Paper – to publicly support the creation of the reserve. Greenpeace has set a clear timeline: these companies are urged to commit to the reserve by June 2017.

If they fail to act, Greenpeace warns that there could be serious consequences for their business relationships. Companies that do not support the Dvinsky Forest Reserve risk facing contract suspensions and consumer boycotts. The message is direct: continued access to markets should depend on a real commitment to protecting the Great Northern Forest.

By exposing destructive logging practices and mobilising customer pressure, Greenpeace aims to ensure that the boreal forests of Arkhangelsk – and the Dvinsky Forest in particular – are preserved, not just on paper, but in practice.
