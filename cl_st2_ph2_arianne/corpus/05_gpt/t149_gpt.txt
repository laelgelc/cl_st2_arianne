Fossil fuel companies are everywhere in our daily lives – not just at petrol stations or in political debates, but in the places we go to relax, have fun, and be inspired. They appear on the jerseys of our favourite teams, on the banners at music festivals, and on the walls of arts and museum spaces. Through glossy ads and “feel-good” sponsorships, they position themselves as partners in culture and progress, even as they continue to drive the climate crisis.

These sponsorships are not neutral. They help fossil fuel companies mislead consumers about their role in global heating and delay the urgent climate action that scientists have been warning about for decades. By associating their brands with beloved cultural spaces, these corporations gain social licence – the public acceptance and legitimacy they need to keep extracting, polluting, and profiting.

In Europe, many of the world’s biggest oil and gas companies have their headquarters. That means European activists are in a unique position – and have a particular responsibility – to challenge these corporations directly. They can confront fossil fuel executives on their home turf, expose the gap between the industry’s public image and its actual practices, and stand in solidarity with communities on the frontlines of climate impacts and fossil fuel extraction.

Frontline communities, often far from European capitals, are among the first and worst affected by pollution, extreme weather, and exploitation tied to fossil fuel projects. Yet their voices are frequently overshadowed by corporate PR campaigns. By using their proximity to fossil fuel power centres, European activists can help amplify these voices, ensuring that the realities of those most affected are heard in the halls of power and in the cultural venues fossil fuel companies seek to co-opt.

Grassroots groups across Europe are responding with a clear demand: #BanFossilAds. They are calling for an end to fossil fuel advertising and sponsorship in sports, music festivals, arts, and museums. Their message is that cultural spaces should not be used as platforms to greenwash an industry whose core business remains incompatible with a safe and just future.

Activists like Mattina, Noëlie, Teresa, and Talissa are speaking out about how these sponsorships function as distractions. They point out that while fossil fuel companies promote themselves as supporters of culture and community, they are simultaneously responsible for pollution, aggressive lobbying against strong climate policies, and the exploitation of people and nature.

By exposing this contradiction, these activists are pushing for radical change. They are challenging not only the presence of fossil fuel logos in cultural spaces, but also the deeper power structures that allow polluting companies to shape public narratives and delay action. Their struggle is about reclaiming culture from corporate influence and ensuring that our shared spaces reflect a commitment to protecting people and the planet.

Ending fossil fuel advertising and sponsorships is one step toward breaking the grip of greenwashing. It is part of a broader fight to shift power away from polluters and toward communities demanding a livable future. European activists, together with frontline communities and grassroots groups, are showing that cultural spaces can be sites of resistance and transformation – places where the truth about the climate crisis is told, and where the call for justice cannot be drowned out by corporate branding.
