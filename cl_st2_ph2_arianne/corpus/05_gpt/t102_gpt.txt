On the deck of the Rainbow Warrior, as it sails along the Egyptian coast, the voices of young people from the Middle East, Africa, and beyond are rising together with one clear message: we must be heard at COP27.

This call has been at the heart of the United for Climate Justice ship tour, where Greenpeace MENA campaigner Nouhad Awwad has been working alongside youth climate leaders to demand that decision-makers listen to those on the frontlines of the climate crisis. Over 400 young climate leaders gathered in Tunisia to strengthen the movement, share their experiences, and build a united front. Some of them are now on board the Rainbow Warrior in Egypt, carrying their demands and hopes directly to the UN climate talks.

For many of these young people, climate change is not an abstract future threat. It is already reshaping their daily lives and their homelands. Communities across the Middle East and Africa are facing devastating droughts, destructive floods, famine, desertification, and rising sea levels. These impacts are tearing through livelihoods, displacing families, and endangering the futures of entire generations who have done the least to cause this crisis.

Yet, while these regions bear the brunt of climate breakdown, rich nations are still failing to provide the financial support that is urgently needed. The promised funds to help vulnerable countries adapt, recover from loss and damage, and build resilient, renewable economies have not materialised at the scale required. This injustice lies at the core of why youth from the Global South are mobilising: they are demanding not charity, but climate justice.

On the United for Climate Justice tour, the Rainbow Warrior is more than a ship; it is a moving platform for solidarity and solutions. From port to port, it is helping carry messages of hope from young people who refuse to accept a future defined by fossil fuels and climate chaos. Their demands are clear: a rapid and just transition away from coal, oil, and gas, and a climate agenda that puts people and planet before profit.

These youth leaders are calling on governments at COP27 to act with the urgency that science and justice require. They are insisting that climate decisions must reflect the lived realities of those in the Global South, where the cost of inaction is already counted in lost homes, lost harvests, and lost lives. They are pushing for a world where the wealthiest countries finally step up, deliver on their financial responsibilities, and support a fair transition that leaves no one behind.

Their voices carry a powerful reminder: climate justice is not only about emissions targets and negotiations in closed rooms. It is about protecting present and future generations, defending communities from worsening disasters, and building a world where every child can grow up with clean air, safe water, and a stable climate.

As the Rainbow Warrior sails towards COP27, it does so as a symbol of this collective determination. The youth on board, and the many more who stand with them across the Middle East, Africa, and the wider Global South, are showing that another future is possible. They are bringing with them not just demands, but courage, solidarity, and the conviction that together, we can turn the tide away from fossil fuels and towards climate justice for all.
