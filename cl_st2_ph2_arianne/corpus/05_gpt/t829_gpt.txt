Resolute Forest Products is trying to drag Greenpeace and Stand.Earth into silence through aggressive lawsuits, but it will not silence the global movement speaking up for forests, oceans, and the climate.

For years, Greenpeace has campaigned to protect the Great Northern Forest from unsustainable logging. This vast forest is critical for biodiversity and for stabilizing our climate. Persistent campaigning has already helped drive important change: companies like Kimberly Clark have taken steps in response to public pressure and demands for more responsible sourcing. These shifts show that when people speak out, major corporations can be pushed to improve their practices.

Resolute Forest Products has chosen a different path. Rather than embracing solutions to protect the forest, the company has launched major lawsuits against Greenpeace entities and Stand.Earth. These legal attacks are aimed at silencing criticism and undermining advocacy that defends forests and the climate. The message behind these lawsuits is clear: if you challenge destructive practices, you risk being dragged into court.

In response, people around the world are raising their voices in solidarity. Supporters are recording themselves saying “our voices are vital” to show that attempts to intimidate or silence advocacy will not work. Each recording is a reminder that collective action and public pressure are essential tools in the fight to protect the planet.

This wave of support has already reached important milestones. Videos have come in from actors and artists including Mark Deklin, Emma Thompson, Tamra Davis, and Jennette McCurdy, each lending their voice to defend the right to speak up for the environment. The band Yon Yonson has contributed a song to amplify the message even further. As the number of recordings climbed to 10,000, illustrator Hannah Rosengren created digital backgrounds to celebrate and support everyone taking part.

Every voice added to this effort strengthens the message that defending forests, oceans, and the climate is not a crime—it is a responsibility. As more people step forward to say “our voices are vital,” they help ensure that legal intimidation cannot drown out the call for environmental justice and protection of the Great Northern Forest.
