In Glasgow, the world is gathering at COP26 with a single, urgent task: turn promises into real climate action. From 31 October to 12 November, governments, NGOs, businesses, and Indigenous groups are meeting to decide how we confront the climate crisis in this critical decade.

For Greenpeace, this summit is not about vague pledges or distant targets. It is about defending the lives and rights of frontline communities already facing the worst climate impacts—people whose homes, livelihoods, and cultures are on the line right now. These communities did the least to cause the crisis, yet they are paying the highest price.

That is why Greenpeace is demanding clear, concrete outcomes from COP26.

First, there can be no more expansion of the very industry driving the crisis. New coal, oil, and gas projects must be stopped. Continuing to open new fossil fuel fields while talking about climate leadership is a deadly contradiction, and it pushes the world further away from a safe future.

Second, global emissions must be at least halved by 2030. This is the decisive decade. Delaying action or betting on future technologies will lock in more extreme heat, storms, floods, and sea-level rise. Real cuts now—especially in high-emitting countries—are essential to keep a livable future within reach.

Third, carbon offsets must be rejected as the scams they are. Offsetting schemes and carbon markets risk becoming a dangerous distraction from the real work of cutting emissions at source. Instead of allowing polluters to buy their way out of responsibility, COP26 must focus on real, deep reductions in fossil fuel use. Carbon markets that enable business-as-usual pollution threaten to derail meaningful progress.

Fourth, justice and solidarity must be at the heart of every decision. High-emitting countries must provide at least $100 billion every year to support adaptation and compensation in vulnerable nations. This funding is not charity; it is a matter of responsibility and fairness. Communities on the frontlines need resources to adapt to the impacts already hitting them and to recover from climate damage they did not cause.

COP26 is the first major climate summit since the Paris Agreement was signed and since the latest IPCC report underscored how narrow the window is to avoid the worst impacts of climate breakdown. That makes this moment especially important. Decisions taken in Glasgow will shape whether the world accelerates toward real emission cuts or hides behind accounting tricks and empty promises.

Greenpeace is at COP26 to push hard for the urgent changes science and justice demand. The path forward is clear: stop new fossil fuel projects, slash emissions by 2030, reject carbon offset scams, and deliver the promised finance to those most at risk. Anything less will fail the people already living with the realities of a warming world.
