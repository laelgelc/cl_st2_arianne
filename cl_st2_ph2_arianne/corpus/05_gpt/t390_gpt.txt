The logging season has started in Germany, and with it a new wave of destruction is threatening some of the country’s remaining forests. While the Dannenroder Forest – “Danni” – is still standing, the chainsaws are getting closer. Nearby, in the Herren and Maulbacher forests, evictions have already taken place and brutal tree cutting has begun. What is happening there is a warning of what could soon reach Danni.

All of this is being done to clear space for a highway expansion. In the middle of a climate crisis and a mass extinction of species, this project is being pushed forward to make room for more polluting cars. Ancient trees are being felled, endangered species are losing their habitat, and even a water reserve is being put at risk – all for a road project that runs directly against the urgent need to protect climate and biodiversity. The hypocrisy is stark: while political leaders talk about climate action, they are simultaneously allowing the destruction of irreplaceable ecosystems.

In response, activists have taken to the trees. In Danni and the surrounding forests, they have built treehouse villages high in the canopy as a form of resistance. These structures are more than shelters – they are symbols of determination to defend the forest and a liveable future. The people in the trees are facing police operations and evictions, yet they continue to hold their ground as part of a growing movement for climate justice.

Hundreds of people are mobilizing around Danni. Their message is clear: the forest must stay. The struggle in Dannenroder, Herren and Maulbacher forests is about far more than a single highway. It is about choosing between protecting ancient forests, endangered species and clean water – or continuing down a path of more traffic, more emissions and more destruction.

Support for this resistance is urgently needed. You can follow developments closely, share updates and information, and help provide practical aid to those on the ground. Social media is a powerful tool in this fight – use it to amplify what is happening and to build pressure on decision-makers. Share the stories and images coming from the forest, and use the hashtag #Dannibleibt to show that Danni must remain.
