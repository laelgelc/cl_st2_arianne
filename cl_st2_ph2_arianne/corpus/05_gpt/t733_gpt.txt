On June 1, when President Trump announced that the United States would withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement, it was framed as a move to put American interests first. Instead, it has turned into a profound miscalculation that has isolated the U.S. from the global community at precisely the moment when cooperation is most needed.

While the U.S. administration stepped back, others stepped up. New Zealand’s decision to ban new offshore oil and gas exploration stands out as a powerful example of leadership. This move did not emerge in a vacuum; it was driven by sustained climate activism demanding an end to fossil fuel expansion and a rapid shift to clean energy. It sends a clear message: governments can and must act decisively when people push them to choose a safer, fairer future.

Around the world, this kind of people-powered momentum is reshaping the energy landscape. In Johannesburg, crowdfunded solar projects are putting clean power directly into community hands, proving that citizens are not waiting for slow national processes to catch up. Communities are resisting new pipelines and coal plants, refusing to accept projects that lock in decades more fossil fuel dependence and pollution. These struggles are not just about emissions; they are about health, land, water, and the right to a livable future.

Financial flows are beginning to shift as well. Major banks are starting to pull money out of fossil fuels, and Norway’s sovereign wealth fund has moved to divest from parts of the fossil fuel sector. These decisions show that the economic case for coal, oil, and gas is eroding, and that long-term stability lies in clean energy, not in propping up an industry driving the climate crisis.

At the heart of these changes is a growing demand for climate justice. People are calling for solutions that protect those who are least responsible for the crisis but most exposed to its impacts. This means not only cutting emissions, but also ensuring that the transition away from fossil fuels is fair—supporting workers and communities as economies are transformed, and recognizing the leadership of those on the frontlines of climate impacts.

Despite the White House’s attempt to derail global climate cooperation, nearly 200 countries have reaffirmed their commitments under the Paris Agreement. Rather than unravel, the international framework has held firm. National governments are not alone in this: cities, regions, and other non-state actors are stepping into the gap, making their own pledges and plans.

Many cities are committing to 100% renewable energy, using their authority over transport, buildings, and local grids to drive down emissions and clean up the air. The World Bank has announced that it will end financing for oil and gas projects, signaling that public finance is beginning to align with climate goals and the realities of a rapidly changing energy system.

All of this points to a simple truth: the direction of travel is clear, and it is away from fossil fuels and toward a clean energy future. The question is not whether this transition will happen, but how fast, and whether it will be just.

With the Global Climate Action Summit approaching, there is an urgent call to join and strengthen this movement. That means pushing for bold commitments to phase out fossil fuels, accelerate renewable energy, and support communities through the transition. It means backing campaigns for divestment, supporting local clean energy projects, and standing with those resisting new fossil fuel infrastructure.

Trump’s announcement on June 1 did not stop climate action. It helped galvanize it. Now is the time to turn that momentum into the deep, rapid transformation the science and justice both demand—by organizing, by speaking out, and by insisting that leaders at every level choose a future powered by clean, renewable energy for all.
