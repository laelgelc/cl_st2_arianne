Plastic has become one of the defining environmental crises of our time, yet public understanding is still clouded by confusion, misinformation, and carefully crafted corporate narratives. The WHY PLASTIC? three-part documentary series by THE WHY Foundation confronts this reality head-on, unpacking how we got here and what needs to change.

The series challenges the widespread belief that recycling is the answer to the plastic problem. For decades, the world has been encouraged to keep consuming plastic as long as we sort it into the right bins. But WHY PLASTIC? shows how this narrative has allowed governments and corporations to delay real solutions while plastic production continues to soar.

At the heart of the series is a critique of our dependence on recycling and industry self-regulation. The films highlight that recycling, as currently practiced, is failing to address the scale and urgency of the crisis. Instead of closing the loop, it often masks a system built on waste, pollution, and profit.

“The Recycling Myth” exposes how the global recycling system is riddled with problems. Rather than being transformed into new products, vast quantities of plastic are exported to other countries, burned in incinerators, or simply dumped. The documentary reveals how this multi-billion-dollar industry is entangled with bribery, fraud, and greenwashing, allowing companies to market themselves as sustainable while their products continue to fuel the crisis. Recycling, presented as a clean solution, too often becomes a way to move the problem out of sight.

The series also shines a spotlight on one of the world’s most powerful brands. “Coca-Cola’s Plastic Promises” takes a critical look at Coca-Cola’s much-publicised “World Without Waste” strategy. The documentary uncovers how this strategy falls short, failing to tackle the company’s massive reliance on single-use plastic. Despite positioning itself as a leader on sustainability, Coca-Cola has been named the world’s top plastic polluter, and its pledges are shown to be deeply flawed.

WHY PLASTIC? makes clear that voluntary commitments and corporate self-regulation are not enough. As long as big brands continue to prioritise single-use packaging, the plastic crisis will worsen. The series calls for a fundamental shift in how products are delivered, stored, and consumed, urging companies like Coca-Cola to move away from disposable plastic and embrace reuse and refill systems instead.

These models—where containers are used again and again rather than thrown away after a single use—offer a pathway to dramatically reduce plastic production and waste. But they require major brands to rethink their business models instead of relying on recycling as a public relations tool.

The WHY PLASTIC? campaign is not just about exposing problems; it is about changing the conversation at a global scale. By aiming to reach more than 100 million people worldwide, the series seeks to build public awareness and pressure for real solutions. In doing so, it challenges all of us to look beyond the comforting myths of recycling and demand that the biggest plastic polluters take responsibility, phase out single-use packaging, and invest in systems that truly protect people and the planet.
