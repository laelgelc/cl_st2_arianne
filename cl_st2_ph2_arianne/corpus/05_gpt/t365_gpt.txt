On January 22, 2021, a historic shift in international law took place: the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW) entered into force. From this date, nuclear weapons became illegal under international law, placed in the same category of prohibition as chemical and biological weapons. This marks a profound change in how the world formally treats these weapons of mass destruction.

The TPNW was adopted in 2017 by 122 states, reflecting a broad and determined push from governments that chose to prioritize disarmament and human security. By October 2020, 50 of those states had ratified the treaty, triggering its entry into force and turning its provisions into binding international law for its members. The treaty’s scope is comprehensive: it bans the production, possession, use, transfer, and financing of nuclear weapons.

For Greenpeace, this milestone coincides with its 50th anniversary year, adding special significance to the moment. The entry into force of the TPNW is celebrated as a major step forward in the long struggle against nuclear weapons, and it also pays tribute to the work of the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN), whose efforts were central to bringing the treaty into being and building support for it.

Nuclear-armed states continue to oppose the TPNW, refusing to join the treaty and challenging its implications. Nonetheless, they now face growing criticism and pressure as the legal and moral stigma around nuclear weapons strengthens. The existence of a global treaty that explicitly outlaws these weapons under international law makes it harder to justify their continued possession and modernization.

Looking ahead, several priorities shape the work around the TPNW. One is universalization: securing more ratifications so that the treaty’s norms and obligations apply to an ever-larger share of the international community. Another is monitoring implementation, ensuring that states parties live up to their commitments and that the treaty’s prohibitions are translated into concrete practice. A third is mobilizing public support, which has already proven crucial in many countries.

Public opinion is an important driver of political change on this issue. In countries such as Finland and Belgium, high approval rates for the TPNW demonstrate that large majorities of people want their governments to back a world free of nuclear weapons. This kind of visible, documented support strengthens the hand of those pushing for ratification and implementation, and it reinforces the broader message that nuclear disarmament is both a legal requirement for many states and a democratic demand from citizens.

The entry into force of the TPNW does not mean nuclear weapons have disappeared, but it does mean that the international legal landscape has fundamentally changed. With clear prohibitions now in place, growing public backing, and increasing pressure on nuclear-armed states, the treaty provides a powerful tool for those working to eliminate these weapons once and for all.
