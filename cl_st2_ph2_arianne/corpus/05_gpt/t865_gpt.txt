Jan and Ineke van Genderen never imagined that living near the DuPont plant in Dordrecht would mean carrying dangerous chemicals in their blood. Yet tests showed that their PFOA levels were elevated, tying their everyday lives to a toxic legacy from the nearby facility. Across the Atlantic, Gwen and Earl Botkin discovered they were also caught in the same web of pollution, as PFOA from DuPont operations contaminated the Ohio River and entered local drinking water.

These are not isolated incidents. They are two faces of a broader pattern of PFC pollution linked to DuPont facilities, where communities have been exposed to hazardous chemicals without their knowledge or consent. In both the Netherlands and the United States, people living, working, and raising families near DuPont plants have had to confront the reality that the water they drink and the environment they depend on have been tainted.

In the US, a class action lawsuit brought this hidden crisis into the open. Legal action on behalf of affected residents revealed that DuPont had for years covered up what it knew about the health risks of PFOA, a key chemical used in its production processes. The lawsuit exposed internal knowledge that PFOA was dangerous, even as communities continued to be exposed.

Scientific findings linked PFOA exposure to serious health impacts, including high cholesterol, several types of cancer, and thyroid problems. These links turned abstract chemical names into very real fears for families like the Botkins and the van Genderens, who had to grapple with what elevated PFOA levels might mean for their health and future.

Instead of ending the problem, DuPont’s move away from PFOA led to another concern: replacement with shorter-chain PFCs. These newer chemicals were introduced as alternatives, but they too are hazardous. Rather than resolving the crisis, this shift risks perpetuating a cycle of toxic substitution, where one dangerous chemical is swapped for another.

Greenpeace has joined forces with affected communities and partner organisations to confront this pollution and demand accountability. Together they have organised protests, pushed for public hearings, and supported investigations into DuPont’s practices and the broader use of PFOA and its replacements. These actions aim to ensure that the voices of people like Jan, Ineke, Gwen, and Earl are heard, and that the true scale of PFC contamination is no longer hidden.

This struggle is far from over. Hazardous PFCs remain in the environment and in people’s bodies, and the shift to shorter-chain alternatives shows how easily the same mistakes can be repeated. Greenpeace is calling on supporters to stand with impacted communities, challenge the continued use of toxic chemicals, and help build the pressure needed to phase out dangerous PFCs and prevent similar crises in the future.

By supporting this work—through amplifying these stories, backing investigations, and demanding stronger protections—people everywhere can help ensure that no community has to discover too late that their water, their environment, and their health have been sacrificed to chemical pollution.
