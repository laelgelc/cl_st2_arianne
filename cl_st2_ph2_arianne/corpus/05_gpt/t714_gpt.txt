The first time the coal barges appeared on the horizon off Karimun Jawa, many people hoped they would just pass through.

For generations, this Indonesian island has been known for something very different: clear blue water, abundant turtles and sharks, and seas so full of fish that families could cast their nets close to shore and return home with enough to feed their children and sell at the market. Karimun Jawa is a national marine park, a place that should be protected, a place where the ocean is central to life, culture, and survival.

Madjuri has fished these waters his entire life. He remembers when the reef was alive with colour and movement, when you could set traps or lines nearby and be confident you’d catch enough. The sea was predictable, generous, and clean. It provided.

Then the coal barges started coming.

They do not pass quietly. They drag their anchors across the seabed, crushing and scraping the reefs that fish, turtles, and countless other creatures depend on. The heavy chains tear through traps and lines that local fishers have carefully set, destroying the tools they rely on to make a living. Bait is lost, gear is ruined, and with each passing barge, another small piece of the reef is ground away.

From the barges, black runoff leaks into the water. The once-clear sea becomes streaked with pollution. The air, too, has changed. Smoke and fumes hang over the waves as the barges move past, and people on the small fishing boats find themselves coughing, their throats burning, sometimes vomiting from the stench and the chemicals carried on the wind. Fishing is no longer just hard work; it has become a health risk.

The fish feel it as well. The noise, the pollution, the constant disturbance drive them away from the traditional fishing grounds. Places that once teemed with life are now quiet and empty. Families who used to fish nearby must go farther and farther from home, spending more on fuel and time, and still coming back with less.

At night, the barges bring a different kind of harm. Their powerful lights blaze across the surface of the water, turning darkness into a harsh artificial day. For local fishers who rely on catching cuttlefish, this is devastating. Cuttlefish are drawn to light, and where they once gathered around the small lamps of local boats, now they swarm around the bright glare of the coal barges instead. The barges take the cuttlefish that should sustain the community, stealing not only the catch but the future of a traditional way of life.

Madjuri and others have not stayed silent. They have complained to the authorities, reported the damage, spoken about the black runoff, the broken reefs, the lost traps, the coughing and sickness, the vanishing fish. They have tried to protect the marine park they are proud of, the home they love. But nothing changes. The barges keep coming.

For families in Karimun Jawa, this is not an abstract environmental issue. It is about whether their children will be able to grow up with the same thriving sea that sustained their parents and grandparents. It is about whether the national marine park will remain a place of rich biodiversity, or become just another damaged coastline sacrificed to coal.

The choice is stark. Coal barges and their pollution, or living seas and secure livelihoods. Madjuri’s message is clear: this destructive trade cannot be allowed to continue unchecked. Standing up to these barges is about defending health, culture, and the right of coastal communities to a clean, living ocean — now and for generations to come.
