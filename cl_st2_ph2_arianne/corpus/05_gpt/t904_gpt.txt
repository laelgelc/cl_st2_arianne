Major household-name brands have taken an important stand for the Arctic by refusing to buy cod caught in one of the most vulnerable parts of the Barents Sea.

McDonald’s, Tesco, Young’s Seafood, Iglo, the Norwegian Fishing Vessel Owners Association, Russian Karat Group, and Espersen have all agreed not to support the expansion of cod fishing into the previously frozen Northern Barents Sea. This commitment amounts to a moratorium on bottom trawling in a sensitive Arctic region roughly twice the size of France.

This area is home to wildlife uniquely adapted to the cold, including polar bears, bowhead whales, and Greenland sharks. As sea ice retreats, these ecosystems are becoming newly accessible to industrial fishing, putting them at risk just as they are being exposed. By refusing to source cod from this frontier, these companies are drawing a line that helps keep destructive bottom trawling out of one of the Arctic’s last relatively untouched marine areas.

Greenpeace is attributing this step forward to people around the world who have raised their voices to protect the Arctic. Public pressure has helped convince major players in the seafood supply chain that some places are simply too important for nature to be opened up to destructive fishing practices.

To help ensure these commitments are upheld, Greenpeace will be monitoring activity in the region from its ship, the Arctic Sunrise. At the same time, Greenpeace is calling on Norway’s government to go further by designating this Northern Barents Sea area as a Marine Protected Area, closed to all extractive industries. That kind of legal protection would lock in the gains achieved so far and help safeguard Arctic wildlife and ecosystems into the future.
