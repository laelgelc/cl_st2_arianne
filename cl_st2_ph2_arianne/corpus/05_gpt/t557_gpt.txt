Across Siberia, more than five million hectares of forest are burning, and less than 90% of these fires are being managed. In the Krasnoyarsk region, Greenpeace Russia’s team has documented how this catastrophe is unfolding on the ground and what it means for the people forced to live in the smoke.

Locals describe a suffocating haze that does not lift. Thick smoke hangs over towns and villages, seeping indoors and making it impossible to find clean air. People report headaches and respiratory problems, and they are exposed to toxins and carcinogens carried in the smoke. Children are suffering too, both outside and inside their homes, with no safe place to escape the impact. The smoke is not limited to a few hotspots; it blankets vast areas, turning everyday life into a struggle to breathe.

Many of the fires are burning in so‑called “zones of control” – areas where, under current rules, authorities are not obliged to extinguish wildfires. In these zones, putting out fires is effectively optional, even when they threaten people’s health and the surrounding environment. This policy has allowed huge areas of forest to burn unchecked, deepening the crisis for local communities and contributing to greater CO2 emissions.

In response, Greenpeace launched a petition demanding change. More than 400,000 people have signed, calling for concrete steps to prevent disasters like this from repeating. As a result of this public pressure, proposed changes to the law are now on the table. These proposals would reduce the size of the “zones of control,” increase budgets for forest fire protection, and strengthen measures to prevent and fight wildfires.

If adopted, these changes could help protect Siberian forests, reduce future wildfire risk, and cut CO2 emissions from massive uncontrolled burns. For the people of Krasnoyarsk and other affected regions, they would also mean a better chance of avoiding summers spent choking on smoke and living with the constant threat of fires on the horizon.
