Moored off Yemen’s Red Sea coast, the abandoned FSO Safer oil tanker is a ticking time bomb. Inside its corroding hull sit more than 1.1 million barrels of crude oil. If this oil were to spill or the vessel were to explode, the consequences for people, wildlife, and the wider region would be catastrophic.

The Red Sea is home to rich marine life and fragile ecosystems. A major spill would smother coastal habitats, poison coral reefs and mangroves, and devastate fisheries. For fishing communities already living with conflict and hardship, losing their main source of food and income would be disastrous. Boats, nets, and gear could be ruined by oil, and fish stocks could collapse or become unsafe to eat for years.

The human health risks are severe. Crude oil contains toxic, carcinogenic substances that can damage vital organs, irritate and burn the skin, and harm the lungs if fumes are inhaled. People exposed during a spill or cleanup can suffer both immediate and long-term health effects. Children, older people, and those with pre-existing health conditions are especially vulnerable.

Any large-scale cleanup would itself create a massive hazardous waste problem. Contaminated sand, soil, debris, and equipment would need to be collected, transported, and treated as dangerous waste. Without proper facilities and strict controls, this waste could spread pollution further and expose workers and communities to even more toxic substances.

Because of these dangers, safety must come first. People should avoid contaminated shorelines, water, and seafood, and must not attempt informal or volunteer cleanups. Without proper training and equipment, such efforts are extremely risky. Protective gear—such as gloves, masks, and appropriate clothing—is essential for anyone involved in response work. Communities should follow guidance from local authorities and humanitarian agencies, report any signs of oil contamination, and never burn oily waste, which can release additional toxic fumes.

Greenpeace welcomes the agreement to transfer the oil off the FSO Safer as an important and overdue step to reduce the immediate risk. But this alone is not enough. Containment booms and standby response equipment need to be deployed and kept ready in case of any leak or accident during or after the transfer. The region cannot afford complacency.

The FSO Safer crisis is a stark warning about the dangers of the oil industry. From extraction to transport and storage, oil carries enormous risks for people and the planet. As long as the world remains dependent on fossil fuels, we will continue to face disasters like this. Greenpeace is calling for an end to the oil industry and a rapid transition to safer, renewable energy systems that protect communities and ecosystems instead of putting them in harm’s way.
