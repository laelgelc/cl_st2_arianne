In October 2017, eight Greenpeace France activists entered the Cattenom nuclear power plant and reached the building housing the spent fuel pool, where they set off fireworks. Their goal was to expose serious security vulnerabilities in France’s aging nuclear reactors, and to show how a successful attack on such sensitive areas could lead to a massive release of radioactivity.

The action was strictly non-violent direct action. By physically reaching the spent fuel pool building, the activists demonstrated that even some of the most sensitive parts of a nuclear site are not adequately protected. This raised concern about what could happen if someone with malicious intent, rather than peaceful protest, were able to access the same areas.

The Cattenom plant is located near the border with Luxembourg, and the incident caused alarm in Luxembourg, which would be directly affected by any major nuclear accident or attack at the site. The action also prompted a French parliamentary investigation into the security of nuclear installations, underscoring that the activists had revealed issues of genuine public interest.

Despite this, the “Cattenom nine” – the eight activists plus one additional person – received heavy sentences. These included jail time, suspended prison terms, and an order to pay €50,000 in damages to the plant’s operator, EDF. When compared with similar non-violent incursions at nuclear or high-security sites in Russia, the UK, and Australia, the penalties imposed in France stand out as significantly harsher.

An appeal hearing is scheduled for 30 October, where the defense will argue that the activists’ actions were justified by a “state of necessity” – that is, that they acted to prevent a greater danger by revealing critical security weaknesses. Support for the activists is being encouraged, whether by following the appeal, sharing their story, or using the suggested link or tweet to show solidarity.
