During the months of lockdown, many of us found ourselves doing things we’d never imagined would suddenly feel so important: baking bread, tending to houseplants, calling neighbours, checking in on family and friends. Stripped of commutes, shopping trips and busy schedules, daily life narrowed to its essentials. That experience revealed something powerful: when everything else falls away, what we really depend on is food, shelter, care, connection and a healthy environment.

Across the world, cities responded to the crisis in ways that made these priorities visible. In the Philippines, some cities used e‑tricycles to distribute food, bringing basic supplies directly to people who needed them. In Brazil, the city of Maricá doubled its basic income, making sure more residents had money for essentials when work and movement were restricted. In Barcelona, municipal rent payments were suspended, recognising that no one should lose their home because of a public health emergency.

These choices showed that when pushed, governments can move quickly, protect people’s needs and experiment with new forms of support. They also opened up a wider conversation about what our cities could look like after the pandemic, and what kind of “normal” we actually want to return to.

Many people began to imagine cities organised around well-being instead of endless consumption. In this vision, efficient public transport replaces traffic jams and pollution, making it easier to move around without a car. Urban gardens and local food systems become common, turning vacant lots and rooftops into spaces that feed communities and bring people together. Advertising loses its grip on public space, with streets and squares freed from constant pressure to buy more. Instead of more shopping malls, there are more parks, libraries and cultural spaces.

In these imagined cities, everyone has secure access to housing and food, not as a privilege but as a basic right. Community exchanges and mutual aid networks are part of everyday life, with neighbours sharing skills, tools and time. The goal is not to maximise consumption, but to make sure everyone can live well within the limits of the planet.

This perspective challenges the consumerism that dominated life before the pandemic. The idea that happiness comes from buying more – more clothes, more gadgets, more “stuff” – was already leaving many people stressed, indebted and unsatisfied, while driving environmental breakdown. Lockdown experiences, and the policies that followed, made it easier to see that a different path is possible.

One concrete example of this shift is Amsterdam’s decision to use Doughnut economics as a guide for its recovery. This framework focuses on meeting everyone’s basic needs while staying within ecological boundaries, rejecting the assumption that economies must always grow, no matter the social or environmental cost. By adopting this approach, Amsterdam signalled a willingness to rethink what progress means in practice.

Similar rethinking is happening in other cities. The C40 network of cities has pledged to align their recovery efforts with climate goals, linking post-pandemic rebuilding to the need for a safer, more sustainable future. On the ground, that has meant changes in how streets and public space are used. Milan, Paris and Bogotá, for example, have expanded bike lanes, making it easier and safer for people to cycle instead of drive. This not only reduces emissions and air pollution but also reshapes everyday life around slower, more human-scale transport.

Food systems are changing too. Cities like Freetown and Montreal have launched food-related initiatives that respond to immediate needs while pointing toward longer-term transformation. These efforts highlight the importance of local, resilient food networks that can support communities in times of crisis and beyond.

Taken together, these experiences and experiments suggest that the lessons of lockdown don’t have to fade as restrictions ease. The rediscovery of simple, essential activities – like baking bread at home – sits alongside new policies and practices that put care, equity and sustainability at the centre of urban life. The challenge now is to carry those insights forward, building cities where everyone’s basic needs are met, where public space serves people rather than consumerism, and where our economies operate within the limits of the planet we all share.
