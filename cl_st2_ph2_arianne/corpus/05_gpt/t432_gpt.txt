Pride Month is often seen as a time of celebration, colour, and visibility. But for many transgender people, including activists within Greenpeace, it is also a time when internal and external pressures feel especially intense.

Parit Chomchuen, a trans man and activist at Greenpeace Thailand, describes living with a constant sense of being pushed into a “box.” This box is made of rigid gender norms and expectations: how masculinity should look, how a body should appear, whether someone “should” take hormones, and whether surgery is seen as a requirement to be recognized in their identity. These questions don’t just come from outside; over time, they can become internalized, turning into self-doubt and quiet struggles that are difficult to name and even harder to escape.

Stepping outside that box has consequences. Parit points to the stigma, discrimination, and transphobia that many transgender people face when they refuse to conform to narrow ideas of gender. These experiences are not abstract; they shape daily life, relationships, and opportunities. They also have serious impacts on mental health, contributing to higher rates of depression among transgender people.

Parit’s reflections are also a call to action. He urges us to remove fixed beliefs about gender and to question the assumptions that keep people locked into harmful stereotypes. This means creating environments—at home, in communities, and within organizations—where people of all genders and sexualities are genuinely welcomed and supported, not just tolerated. It also means standing up for queer rights in workplaces and movements, ensuring that policies, practices, and cultures reflect real inclusion.

For Parit, queer activism and environmental activism are deeply connected. As an activist at Greenpeace Thailand, he links the fight for gender justice with Greenpeace’s broader campaigns for environmental and social justice. Through the Global Rainbow Network, he underscores that injustice—whether based on gender identity, sexuality, or environmental harm—shares common roots in systems that devalue certain lives and communities. Challenging those systems, and building solidarity across struggles, is essential to creating a just and livable world for everyone.
