In 2018, Greenpeace Malaysia campaigner Heng Kiah Chun met chemist-turned-activist Pua Lay Peng in Jenjarom, Selangor. At the time, the town was reeling from a surge of pollution caused by imported plastic waste that had flooded into Malaysia after China’s ban on plastic waste imports.

In response to the choking air and contaminated surroundings, Pua helped form and lead the grassroots group Persatuan Tindakan Alam Sekitar Kuala Langat. What began as local frustration grew into an organized community effort. Drivers, lawyers, housewives, and many others came together under a shared goal: to reclaim their right to clean air and water.

Their work was intensive and persistent. They held community meetings, conducted fieldwork to document what was happening on the ground, and compiled reports. They filed complaints to the authorities, pushing for enforcement against illegal operations. Through these efforts, more than 300 illegal facilities were shut down.

The struggle came with serious risks. Pua and others received death threats, but they continued their work and expanded their efforts beyond Jenjarom to other affected areas. Along the way, they helped other communities understand their rights and how to organize, empowering people facing similar pollution.

Pua’s advocacy did not stop at Malaysia’s borders. She carried the stories and demands of her community to international platforms, including in New Zealand and Brussels. Her leadership and courage were recognized in 2019, when she received a civil society award for her work.
