On a cold January 17 in Berlin, thousands of people took to the streets for the “We are fed up” march against agribusiness. Among them was Eric Darier, who was struck not only by the size of the crowd, but by what it represented: a deep, shared concern about how our food is produced and where it comes from. The turnout showed that food is no longer something people are willing to take for granted—it’s political, social, and personal all at once.

Darier was particularly surprised by the strength of Germany’s food movement, which he found comparable to what has been growing in North America. In Berlin, the message was clear: many people are “fed up” with a food system that prioritizes industrial production over health, nature, and fairness.

The march and Darier’s reflections highlight a series of failures in the current food system. These include the widespread use of pesticides and genetically engineered seeds, which raise concerns about environmental and health impacts. Industrial animal farming is another major issue, contributing to pollution and suffering on a massive scale. Fertilizers, used intensively in industrial agriculture, are polluting water and ecosystems. Trade deals like TTIP and CETA are seen as weakening vital protections, making it easier for corporate interests to override environmental and social safeguards. All of this is happening while bees—essential pollinators for many of our crops—are under serious threat.

Yet Darier’s account is not just a critique; it is grounded in hope. He points to the growing number of people who are already building alternatives in their daily lives. More and more are choosing organic food, cutting down on meat, and buying from local producers. Others are starting their own gardens, even in small spaces, to regain some control over what they eat. Many are joining food justice groups and movements that push for fairer, more sustainable food systems.

These everyday actions demonstrate that change is not only possible, but already underway. They show that people are willing to rethink their relationship with food—from how it’s grown and transported to who profits and who pays the price.

Darier ends with a clear call to action: get involved. He urges readers to connect with local farms, support farmers who are trying to do things differently, and join local movements working for better food systems. By linking up with others and backing real alternatives, each of us can help shift the balance away from industrial agribusiness and toward a food system that respects people, animals, and the planet.
