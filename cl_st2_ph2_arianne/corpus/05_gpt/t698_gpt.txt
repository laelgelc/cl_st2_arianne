Vegan cafes are popping up on high streets and side streets alike, and with them comes a growing curiosity about what plant-based eating actually looks like day to day. In a recent conversation, vegan dietitian Heather Russell from The Vegan Society shared how this shift is changing our plates, our health, and potentially the planet.

One of the first things she highlights is just how surprising plant-based meals can be. Many people still imagine vegan food as restrictive or repetitive, but the rise of vegan cafes is proving the opposite: plant-based menus now range from hearty comfort food to inventive dishes built around vegetables, pulses, grains, nuts, and seeds. For Heather, this creativity is a powerful way to show that vegan eating can be both satisfying and nutritionally sound.

She is clear, though, that a healthy vegan diet doesn’t happen by accident. Some nutrients need particular attention, especially vitamin B12, vitamin D, iodine, and selenium. Heather stresses the importance of appropriate supplementation for vegans, alongside fortified foods where relevant, to make sure these essentials aren’t overlooked. Rather than treating supplements as an afterthought, she presents them as a normal, sensible part of well-planned plant-based living.

At the same time, she cautions against assuming that anything labelled “vegan” is automatically healthy. Vegan junk food can still be high in fat, sugar, and salt. Heather encourages people to base their diets around whole grains, nuts, fruits, vegetables, and legumes, using more processed options as occasional extras rather than staples. This balance helps ensure that veganism supports long-term health, not just short-term convenience.

Affordability is a recurring concern for many considering a plant-based diet, and Heather addresses this directly. She points to staples like legumes, grains, and seasonal vegetables as examples of how vegan eating can be cost-effective, especially when meals are cooked from scratch. She also notes that veganism can be adapted to different cultural food traditions, building on familiar flavours and dishes rather than replacing them with entirely new foods.

When it comes to new technologies, Heather is cautious about lab-grown meat, particularly where animal products are still involved in the production process. From her perspective, this raises ethical questions that undermine the purpose of moving away from animal-based foods in the first place.

Sustainability runs through her recommendations. She underscores the value of choosing seasonal produce and other sustainable options as part of a broader shift toward plant-based diets. In her view, we are likely to see more people adopting plant-based eating for both environmental and health reasons in the years ahead.

For anyone wondering where to start, Heather suggests simple, practical steps: add legumes to meals you already enjoy, and experiment with plant milks. These small changes can open the door to a wider variety of plant-based foods and help people build confidence in cooking and eating vegan dishes.
