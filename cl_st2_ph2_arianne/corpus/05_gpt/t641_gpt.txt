From 23–26 May, people across Europe have a powerful opportunity: to choose what kind of future we want by voting in the European Parliament elections. This isn’t just another date on the political calendar. It’s a chance to stand up to authoritarian politicians, defend our freedoms, and demand a fair society that protects both our rights and the planet we share.

The European Union is far from perfect. It has made mistakes, moved too slowly on some issues, and too often listened to powerful corporate interests over ordinary people. But it has also delivered real, tangible gains that have improved millions of lives. Thanks to EU-wide rules, the air in many of our cities is cleaner than it used to be. Dangerous toxic chemicals have been banned from products we use every day. These are victories that no single country could have won alone.

Climate change, pollution, and ecosystem breakdown do not stop at national borders. Smoke from coal plants, pesticides in rivers, and greenhouse gas emissions all drift and spread, affecting people thousands of kilometres away. That’s why collective action at the European level is so important. When 27 countries act together, they can set standards that shape entire industries, drive global change, and protect communities from harm.

But this shared power is exactly what some politicians want to capture and twist. Across the continent, xenophobic and authoritarian parties are fighting for more influence in the European Parliament. They want to use EU institutions to restrict people’s freedoms, undermine democratic checks and balances, and roll back protections for nature and the climate. If they succeed, they could accelerate the climate crisis and make it harder for people to speak out or organise in defence of their rights.

There are three urgent reasons to vote in these elections.

First, what happens in the European Parliament over the next few years will be decisive for the climate. We are entering a critical decade in which we either manage to avert the worst climate chaos, or lock in escalating heatwaves, droughts, floods, and social disruption. The EU has the power to set ambitious climate targets, drive a rapid shift away from fossil fuels, and support a just transition that leaves no community behind. The people elected now will shape whether Europe takes that responsibility seriously.

Second, the Parliament helps decide how we deal with pollution and how our major systems work, including farming. From the food we eat to the air we breathe and the water we drink, EU decisions influence what is grown in our fields, what is sprayed on crops, how animals are treated, and how land is used. The same is true for industrial emissions, waste, and chemicals. Voting is a way to demand that these systems are transformed to protect health, nature, and climate instead of sacrificing them for short-term profit.

Third, basic rights and freedoms are under threat in several EU countries, including Hungary, Poland, and Spain. Press freedom has been attacked, independent journalism undermined, and protesters criminalised or intimidated. The right to organise, to criticise those in power, and to take to the streets in peaceful protest is essential for any functioning democracy—and for any meaningful climate and social justice movement. The European Parliament can be a voice defending these rights, or it can become a tool for those who want to erode them.

Abstaining from this vote does not make you neutral; it hands more power to those who are already organised to strip away protections and push us deeper into climate and social crisis. Voting is not the only way to create change, but in this moment it is a crucial one. It is a way to say no to xenophobia and authoritarianism, and yes to a fairer, greener Europe where people and the planet come before hate and exploitation.

From 23–26 May, use your vote. Use it to protect hard-won freedoms, to push for bold climate action, and to demand an EU that stands up for justice, human rights, and a liveable planet for everyone.
