Energy Transfer Partners (ETP), the company behind the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL), has shown again and again that it is willing to push communities, the law, and basic human rights aside in pursuit of profit.

The Dakota Access Pipeline was pushed through without the consent of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, whose land, water, and cultural survival are directly threatened by the project. Despite clear opposition, ETP went ahead and bulldozed sacred sites, erasing irreplaceable cultural heritage and deepening the trauma and injustice faced by the Tribe. Even when government agencies called for a halt, ETP pressed on, treating those calls as obstacles to be steamrolled rather than warnings to be respected.

Communities and water protectors who stood up to this abuse were met not with dialogue, but with force. ETP’s response included excessive force against peaceful opponents and arbitrary arrests aimed at intimidating and silencing resistance. Instead of respecting the right to protest, ETP escalated its tactics and treated public opposition as a problem to be crushed.

The company also turned to the courts to try to shut down its critics. Through strategic lawsuits against public participation (SLAPP suits), ETP targeted opponents, including Greenpeace, in an attempt to drain resources, intimidate activists, and discourage others from speaking out. These lawsuits are not about justice; they are about silencing dissent.

ETP’s ties to TigerSwan, a security firm known for military-style tactics, further reveal how far the company is willing to go. Rather than engaging in good-faith consultation or addressing community concerns, ETP leaned on militarized approaches that belong on a battlefield, not in peaceful protests led by Indigenous communities and their allies.

Beyond Standing Rock, ETP has supported and benefited from anti-protest laws that criminalize those who dare to defend their land, water, and rights. The company’s pattern of seizing property and pushing ahead over local opposition underscores a broader strategy: rewrite the rules, marginalize affected communities, and clear the path for fossil fuel expansion at any cost.

This disregard for people is mirrored in ETP’s treatment of the environment. The company has a poor safety record marked by frequent spills and fines. Each incident is another reminder that pipelines are not the safe, clean solution the industry claims. They leak. They spill. They contaminate. And the communities forced to live with that risk are often those who already bear the brunt of environmental injustice.

Greenpeace USA’s report, “Too Far, Too Often,” lays out this pattern of abuse and calls on banks to end their financial ties with Energy Transfer Partners. When banks continue to back ETP, they are not neutral—they are enabling a company that has repeatedly shown contempt for Indigenous rights, human rights, and environmental safety.

Ending financial support for ETP is a concrete step institutions can take to stand with the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and all communities facing similar threats. As long as money flows to companies like ETP, so will the pipelines, the spills, the repression, and the violations of rights.

It is time for banks to listen, to recognize the evidence, and to act. Cutting ties with Energy Transfer Partners is not only a moral imperative—it is a necessary step toward a future where human rights and a safe environment are not sacrificed for fossil fuel profits.
