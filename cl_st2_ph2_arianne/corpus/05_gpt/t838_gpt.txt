Over four days at sea in Sierra Leone’s waters, Greenpeace and local fisheries inspectors uncovered a string of illegal fishing cases that exposed just how vulnerable West African oceans remain to abuse.

Working from the Greenpeace ship Esperanza, the joint team boarded several industrial fishing vessels. On one vessel, inspectors found infractions serious enough that the authorities confiscated the captain’s passport and issued fines, underlining that violations would not go unanswered.

Two Chinese-flagged trawlers, Fu Hai Yu 1111 and Fu Hai Yu 2222, were caught hiding undersized fishing nets with a mesh size of just 51mm. These nets are too small to meet legal requirements and threaten juvenile fish populations. Inspectors also discovered shark carcasses on board, no logbooks to record fishing activities, and evidence that the vessels had been offloading fish without the necessary licenses. Both ships were ordered back to port to face further action by Sierra Leonean authorities.

The team then inspected an Italian-flagged vessel and found around 4kg of shark fins on board. This violates European Union rules on shark finning. Greenpeace will report this case to the relevant EU authorities to push for enforcement beyond West African waters.

A Korean vessel, the Cona, presented a different set of problems. Its name had been obscured, its Automatic Identification System (AIS) was switched off, and the crew were living in poor conditions. Inspectors also found that the Cona was using 53mm mesh nets, below the legal minimum of 60mm. Each of these factors raised serious concerns about transparency, safety, and compliance with fishing regulations.

These four days at sea revealed more than just individual violations. They showed how much illegal and destructive fishing can slip through the cracks without active monitoring and strong enforcement. The author concludes with a clear message: West African governments need to work together to manage their shared ocean resources. Only through cooperation, coordinated inspections, and firm action against law-breaking vessels can the region protect its fisheries, coastal communities, and marine life.
