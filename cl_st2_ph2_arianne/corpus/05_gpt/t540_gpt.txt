The latest IPCC report makes one thing unmistakably clear: the climate crisis is also an oceans crisis. Our seas are central to life on Earth. They feed billions of people, regulate our climate, and store vast amounts of carbon. When we damage the oceans, we undermine one of our strongest natural allies in tackling climate breakdown.

Human-driven CO2 emissions are heating the planet, and the oceans are absorbing much of that excess heat. This is driving the melting of ice, rising sea levels, and ocean acidification. These changes are devastating marine ecosystems, from coral reefs to the countless species that depend on them. At the same time, destructive activities like overfishing, offshore drilling, and plastic pollution are compounding the damage, pushing ocean life closer to the brink.

Protecting the oceans is not optional; it is essential for climate stability, food security, and the health of the planet. That is why governments must urgently prioritize ongoing UN negotiations to secure a strong Global Ocean Treaty. This treaty must enable the creation of ocean sanctuaries that fully protect at least 30% of the world’s oceans by 2030. Properly protected areas give marine life the space to recover, rebuild, and strengthen the resilience of ocean ecosystems.

But ocean protection alone is not enough. World leaders must rapidly accelerate the shift to renewable energy, end deforestation, and cut greenhouse gas emissions to zero. Every year of delay deepens the damage to our seas and makes recovery harder.

People around the world are already demanding action. Nearly two million have joined the call for governments to protect the oceans and confront the climate crisis with the urgency it demands. Add your voice, stand with them, and help push leaders to deliver the strong Global Ocean Treaty and bold climate action our shared blue planet needs.
