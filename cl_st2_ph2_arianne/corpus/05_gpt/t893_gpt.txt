Repsol’s decision to walk away from its Chukchi Sea oil leases leaves Shell as the last remaining leaseholder in US Arctic waters. This moment underlines a reality that industry hype has long tried to obscure: the long-promised Arctic oil boom never arrived, and for good reason.

Companies have spent years talking up the Arctic as a “new frontier” for oil and gas, but a combination of strict regulations, sustained low oil prices, extremely high operating costs, and heavy ice coverage has made those promises ring hollow. Operating in the Arctic is technically difficult and financially risky. Ice and harsh weather restrict drilling seasons, damage equipment, and drive up costs. At the same time, regulations—hard-won safeguards intended to protect fragile ecosystems and coastal communities—further limit what companies can do and how fast they can do it. When oil prices are low, these expensive, risky projects make even less sense, and investors start to question whether they are worth pursuing at all.

Beyond the economics and logistics, drilling in the Arctic raises stark safety and environmental concerns. In such extreme conditions, oil spills are not a question of “if” but “when.” And when they happen, they are effectively impossible to clean up. Darkness for much of the year, sub-zero temperatures, shifting sea ice, and remote locations mean that response teams cannot deploy quickly or effectively. Standard spill response tools—booms, skimmers, burning, dispersants—simply do not work as intended in ice-choked, stormy waters. Once oil enters this environment, it can persist for years, harming wildlife, fisheries, and the people who depend on them.

Local communities have repeatedly raised their voices against Arctic offshore drilling. They understand that their food security, culture, and health are intimately tied to the ocean and ice. For them, an oil spill is not just an environmental risk; it threatens their way of life. Their opposition is grounded in lived experience of the Arctic’s fragility and the limits of industry promises about safety and preparedness.

All of this sits within the broader context of climate change. The Arctic is warming faster than almost anywhere else on Earth, and pursuing new fossil fuel frontiers there runs directly counter to the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Opening new areas for offshore drilling locks in future emissions at a time when the science is clear that most fossil fuel reserves must stay in the ground to avoid the worst climate impacts. Continuing to chase Arctic oil means doubling down on the very fuels driving the melting of the ice that makes drilling so dangerous in the first place.

History shows that the Arctic offshore oil dream has been failing for decades. Lease rushes in the 1980s and 1990s, and again in 2008, created waves of excitement and speculation. Companies snapped up leases, promising jobs, energy security, and technological breakthroughs. Yet these waves ended in disappointment and retreat, leaving behind a trail of abandoned plans and wasted public and private money. Billions of dollars have been poured into exploration, infrastructure, and failed drilling campaigns without delivering the anticipated production.

Shell’s 2012 Arctic mishap stands out as a clear example of how badly things can go wrong. It highlighted the gap between corporate assurances and the reality of operating in the Arctic. Instead of showcasing cutting-edge capability, it underscored how unprepared companies can be for the region’s challenges, even after investing vast sums of money. The incident became a symbol of the broader failure of Arctic offshore drilling efforts: high-risk, high-cost ventures that repeatedly fall short of their promises.

Repsol’s exit from the Chukchi Sea is not an isolated business decision; it is part of a pattern showing that Arctic offshore drilling is a bad bet—economically, environmentally, and morally. With Shell now standing alone as the last leaseholder in US Arctic waters, the case for continuing to offer new offshore leases is weaker than ever.

This is a critical moment to change course. Instead of clinging to a failed vision of Arctic oil expansion, it is time to end new US offshore drilling leases altogether. Doing so would help protect fragile Arctic ecosystems, respect the concerns of local communities, and align energy policy with the urgent need to confront climate change. The history of wasted billions and repeated failures in the Arctic should be a lesson, not a blueprint. Ending new offshore leasing is a necessary step toward a safer, more sustainable future.
