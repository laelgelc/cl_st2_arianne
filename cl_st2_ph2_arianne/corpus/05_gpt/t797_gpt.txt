Around the world, the energy landscape is changing. Countries, cities and companies are beginning to turn their backs on coal, oil and gas, and invest in clean, renewable energy instead. This shift is not just about technology or economics; it is about whether we can move fast enough to avoid the worst impacts of climate chaos.

Against this backdrop, one of the world’s largest electronics companies is falling dangerously behind. Samsung Electronics, a global brand with enormous influence and resources, currently sources only about 1% of its energy from renewable sources. Despite its size and technological capacity, the company has so far failed to match the urgency of the climate crisis with an equally urgent energy transition.

Samsung has said it will announce a renewable energy strategy by August 2018. But this slow, cautious approach stands in stark contrast to how quickly the company can act when it chooses to. When the Galaxy Note7 crisis hit, Samsung moved at lightning speed to recall millions of phones around the world, proving that it can mobilize vast resources and make rapid decisions when its reputation is on the line.

Climate change is every bit as urgent as a product recall—indeed, far more so. Yet Samsung’s response has been to delay, to wait, and to offer only minimal progress while the clock keeps ticking.

In South Korea, where Samsung is headquartered, the contrast is especially stark. The Korean government has set a target of generating 20% of the country’s electricity from renewable sources by 2030. The 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang are set to be powered by 100% renewable energy, showcasing what is possible when there is political will and clear ambition. But one of the Games’ most prominent sponsors, Samsung, is nowhere near matching that level of commitment in its own operations.

Korean citizens are already ahead of many corporations on this issue. A recent survey found that 85% of people in South Korea want companies to move to 100% renewable energy. The public understands that clean energy is not just an environmental necessity but also a moral and economic imperative. They expect leading brands to step up, not drag their feet.

Samsung now faces a choice. It can continue with business as usual, clinging to fossil fuels and slow, incremental changes, or it can recognize the scale of the crisis and act accordingly. With its global reach, technological expertise and financial power, Samsung could help accelerate the transition to renewables—not just in South Korea, but across its entire supply chain and the many countries where it operates.

If Samsung chooses delay, it risks being remembered as a company that stood on the wrong side of history at a critical moment for the planet. If it chooses courage, it can help drive the clean energy revolution we urgently need.

This is why we are calling on Samsung to commit to a swift and meaningful transition to 100% renewable energy. We are asking people everywhere to add their voices, sign the petition, and tell Samsung to #DoBiggerThings—not in marketing slogans, but in real-world action that helps protect our shared future.
