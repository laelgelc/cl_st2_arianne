Across Russia’s largest cities, people are clearly breathing air they don’t trust. Greenpeace Russia’s research shows that 82% of Moscow residents and 77% of those in St. Petersburg are dissatisfied with the air quality where they live. Most of them point to the same main culprit: emissions from fossil-fuel vehicles.

These concerns are now beginning to translate into concrete political steps. Following recommendations from the Human Rights Council, the Russian government has proposed the introduction of low-emission zones that would restrict the use of vehicles below the Euro-3 emissions standard. Moscow and St. Petersburg have been instructed to develop detailed roadmaps for how to put these zones into practice.

This is a significant breakthrough. It reflects ideas that Greenpeace Russia has been advancing for years, including through its 2017 transport scenario. That scenario outlined how changes in urban mobility could substantially reduce harmful exhaust gases. The proposed low-emission zones are designed to cut vehicle nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by 25%. They follow successful models already used in a number of European cities, where restricting the dirtiest vehicles has helped to reduce air pollution and climate-warming emissions.

But setting rules for vehicles is only one part of the transformation needed. For low-emission zones to work fairly and effectively, people must have good alternatives to car use. That means improving public transport so it is reliable, affordable and convenient, and expanding safe infrastructure for cycling. These steps are essential not only for cleaner air in Moscow and St. Petersburg, but also as part of wider global efforts to build green, sustainable mobility systems that protect both people’s health and the climate.
