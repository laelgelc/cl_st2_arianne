In May 2020, a massive environmental disaster unfolded near Norilsk, in the Russian Arctic, when over 20,000 tons of diesel fuel spilled from a Norilsk Nickel tank. The fuel poured into the Ambarnaya River and surrounding waterways, becoming the largest oil spill ever recorded in the polar Arctic. The scale and location of the spill turned it into a stark symbol of the risks fossil fuel infrastructure poses in a rapidly warming and fragile region.

The state environmental watchdog Rosprirodnadzor took the company to court, and the case resulted in an unprecedented ruling: Norilsk Nickel was ordered to pay 146 billion rubles in damages, nearly 2 billion US dollars. This became the largest environmental compensation award in Russian history, underlining both the severity of the damage and the growing recognition of the costs of industrial pollution.

Greenpeace used satellite and other space imagery to document and highlight the disaster, making the extent of the spill visible to the public and decision-makers. Together with the independent newspaper Novaya Gazeta, Greenpeace also took part in an expedition to the affected area. Despite restrictions imposed by the company, the expedition revealed that oil products were continuing to spread downstream, moving toward the Kara Sea. This showed that the contamination was not contained to the immediate spill site, but was threatening broader Arctic marine ecosystems.

The spill underscored the urgent need to phase out oil and transition to carbon-free energy sources. It also reinforced calls for a green recovery that prioritizes climate action and environmental protection over further fossil fuel expansion. The disaster highlighted how oil and diesel spills in the Arctic can have long-lasting and far-reaching impacts on ecosystems and on Indigenous communities who depend on healthy land and waters for their livelihoods and cultures. Addressing these impacts, and preventing future disasters, means moving away from fossil fuels and toward a safer, sustainable energy system.
