For two years, Greenpeace’s ship Esperanza sailed the Atlantic with a clear purpose: to show the world the wonders of the Amazon Reef and to help protect it from the threat of oil drilling. This mission brought together scientists, local communities and people across the globe who refused to accept that a unique and little-known ecosystem could be put at risk for oil.

On board the Esperanza, Greenpeace campaigners and scientists worked to capture the first images of the Amazon Reef. These images revealed a hidden underwater world at the mouth of the Amazon River, helping to prove what many had long suspected: this was a precious and fragile environment that needed protection, not exploitation. Sharing these images with the world helped turn a distant, abstract place into something real that millions of people could see and care about.

The campaign did not stop at sea. On land, activists confronted the oil giant Total directly, even disrupting one of the company’s meetings to make sure the Amazon Reef could not be quietly sacrificed behind closed doors. This was part of a wider effort to hold powerful companies publicly accountable for their plans to drill near the reef.

What made this campaign truly global was the more than 2 million people who stood up as Amazon Reef Defenders. From local communities to supporters around the world, they added their voices, signatures and actions to a growing chorus demanding that the reef be protected and that oil companies stay away. Their support helped turn a single campaign into a worldwide movement.

That pressure paid off. In a historic decision, Brazil’s environmental agency Ibama denied Total’s license to drill near the Amazon Reef. This was a major defeat for a powerful oil company and a clear sign that people power can help stop destructive projects. It also showed that the movement to end the age of oil is gaining real strength, capable of winning concrete victories against the fossil fuel industry.

Yet the work is not over. While stopping Total’s drilling plans was a crucial step, the Amazon Reef still does not have full and permanent protection. The reef remains vulnerable as long as oil companies and others can try again in the future. The fight now is to secure lasting safeguards so that this unique ecosystem is defended not only from this project, but from any new threats that might come.

Everyone who took part in this campaign—on the Esperanza, in local communities, and in countries around the world—is part of this victory. They are being hailed as heroes of the Amazon Reef, showing that when millions of people unite behind a shared goal, they can change the course of events. Their achievement is both a celebration and a call to continue pushing until the Amazon Reef is safe for good.
