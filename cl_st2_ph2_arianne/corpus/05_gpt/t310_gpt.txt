One year after the catastrophic diesel spill near Norilsk in Russia’s Arctic, the consequences of oil dependence in fragile northern ecosystems remain painfully clear. The 2020 disaster, caused by a massive fuel leak from a storage tank, became one of the largest oil product spills in the Arctic. It also triggered the largest compensation in Russian environmental history: Norilsk Nickel was ordered to pay 150 billion rubles for the damage.

Yet, despite this landmark decision and the public attention it generated, oil accidents in Russia’s Arctic regions have not stopped. Over the past year, new leaks have been recorded in the Komi Republic and the Nenets Autonomous Okrug, underscoring that the Norilsk spill was not an isolated incident but part of a systemic problem linked to aging infrastructure and continued reliance on fossil fuels.

In response, Greenpeace Russia has focused on making the scale and risks of Arctic oil operations more visible to the public. One of the key steps has been mapping oil storage facilities across the Arctic. This mapping effort is aimed at increasing transparency: by showing where hazardous infrastructure is located, it becomes harder to ignore the risks it poses to local communities, ecosystems, and the climate. Publicly accessible information can support demands for better oversight and stronger environmental protections.

Greenpeace Russia notes that the dangers of aging industrial infrastructure are not a new issue. A 2018 presidential decree explicitly addressed the problem of worn-out facilities, recognizing that old and poorly maintained equipment increases the risk of accidents. The Norilsk disaster is a stark illustration of what happens when these risks are not adequately managed. The historic compensation ruling against Norilsk Nickel is significant, but it comes after the damage has already been done to Arctic rivers, soil, and wildlife.

Regulators have begun to react. Rostekhnadzor, Russia’s industrial safety watchdog, has launched inspections of hazardous facilities in the Arctic. Greenpeace Russia welcomes these inspections as a necessary step. However, they stress that inspections alone are not enough. To prevent future spills, there must be systematic monitoring of infrastructure conditions, stronger enforcement of safety standards, and a clear plan to retire the most dangerous facilities before they fail.

At the same time, Greenpeace Russia argues that technical fixes and better oversight will not solve the underlying problem: continued dependence on fossil fuels in one of the most climate‑sensitive regions on Earth. They call for a gradual phase‑out of fossil fuel production and a transition toward renewable energy. In the Arctic, where climate change is unfolding faster than in most of the world, reducing oil and gas activity is not only about preventing local spills; it is also about addressing the global climate crisis that is already transforming the region.

Russia’s current role as chair of the Arctic Council gives it a unique opportunity to change course. According to Greenpeace Russia, this is the moment to prioritize a green economic pathway for the Arctic instead of doubling down on fossil fuel extraction. A proposed Russian Green Deal could be a central tool for this shift. By focusing on renewable energy, energy efficiency, and sustainable industries, such a plan could create new jobs while reducing the likelihood of future oil spills and the long‑term costs of environmental damage.

The Norilsk disaster, the ongoing leaks in Komi and the Nenets region, and the acknowledged problem of aging infrastructure all point to the same conclusion: the current model of Arctic development is unsafe and unsustainable. Greater transparency through tools like the Arctic oil storage map, more rigorous monitoring and inspections, and a strategic move away from fossil fuels toward renewables are all necessary steps to protect the Arctic’s people and ecosystems.

One year on from the Norilsk spill, Greenpeace Russia’s message is that the lessons are clear and the solutions are within reach. The question now is whether they will be implemented in time to prevent the next major disaster—and to set the Arctic on a path toward a safer, greener future.
