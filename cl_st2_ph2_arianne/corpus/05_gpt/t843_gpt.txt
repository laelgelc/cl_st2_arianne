Samsung has announced that it will recycle its recalled Galaxy Note 7 phones in a more environmentally responsible way. This decision follows months of global pressure from Greenpeace supporters and activists, who took action through petitions, online campaigns, and protests calling on the company to address the environmental impact of the recall.

Instead of simply disposing of millions of devices, Samsung now plans to refurbish unsold Note 7 units for resale where appropriate, repurpose usable components such as cameras, and extract raw materials from the remaining phones in a way that is less harmful to the environment. The company has also committed to join European Union research efforts aimed at developing more eco‑friendly methods of recycling smartphones.

This is an important step, but it also shines a light on deeper, systemic problems in the electronics industry. Today’s devices are often designed to be short‑lived, difficult or impossible to repair, and quickly replaced by new models. This wasteful production model drives a growing mountain of electronic waste, much of which ends up in places where it harms people and the environment.

Many factories producing our gadgets are still powered by coal, contributing to climate change, while hazardous chemicals used in manufacturing and recycling can put workers and nearby communities at risk. These problems cannot be solved by one product recall alone—they require a transformation of how the entire IT sector designs, produces, and manages its products.

Greenpeace is calling on Samsung and other technology companies to move toward truly sustainable, closed‑loop production systems. That means designing devices to last longer, be easily repaired, and have their components recovered and reused at the end of their life, all while transitioning factories and supply chains to renewable energy.

Samsung’s new commitments on the Note 7 are a response to public pressure, and they show that when people speak out, companies can change course. But promises on paper are only the beginning. Greenpeace will continue to monitor how Samsung follows through on its plans for the Note 7 and beyond.

To help drive broader change, Greenpeace will also keep evaluating and scoring major electronics brands on how repairable their products are, pushing the industry toward devices that are built to last, easy to fix, and part of a circular economy rather than a throwaway system.
