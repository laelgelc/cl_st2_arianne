In 2019, something extraordinary happened. Across continents and cultures, millions of people stepped into the streets, onto the frontlines, and into the public conversation to demand better for our shared home. It was a year when people everywhere raised their voices to call out corporations and governments for failing to take the action that the climate crisis demands.

At the same time, 2019 was devastating. Around the world, communities were hit hard by extreme weather events fueled by climate change. Lives, homes, and ecosystems were torn apart as fires, storms, floods, and droughts showed, with terrifying clarity, that the climate emergency is not a distant threat but a present reality.

Yet even amid this destruction and fear, 2019 became a landmark year for people power. Communities refused to be silent or divided. Instead, they came together—organizing, marching, protecting their local environments, and standing up for a greener, more sustainable, and more hopeful future. The courage and determination shown in the face of adversity turned a year of crisis into a year of historic mobilization.

These moments of resistance, solidarity, and hope were captured throughout the year. To revisit the power of this global movement, and to remember what collective action can achieve even in the hardest times, we invite you to explore Greenpeace’s highlights from 2019.
