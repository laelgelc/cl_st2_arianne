Alexi didn’t start out as a fire specialist. He began as a volunteer picking up garbage in a park, doing what many people do when they first decide to help their local environment. Over time, he saw first-hand how fires were changing the landscapes he cared about. That experience, combined with Greenpeace Russia’s long history of working on wildfires, drew him into a new role: using science and field experience to fight some of the most dangerous and stubborn fires on Earth—peat fires.

Peat fires are very different from the flames most people imagine when they think of wildfires. They can burn underground, smoldering for weeks or even months. They’re often invisible on the surface, but they release huge amounts of carbon into the atmosphere and send out toxic smoke that can travel long distances. These fires are made worse by climate change, and in turn, they help accelerate it. When peatlands burn, they release carbon that has been stored for thousands of years, contributing to global warming and threatening biodiversity.

Greenpeace Russia has spent decades working with firefighters and volunteers like Alexi to understand how peat fires start, spread, and can be stopped. This work has led to a comprehensive guide on peat extinguishing, developed from scientific research and practical experience in the field. The guide, now available in English, explains the complex hydrology of peatlands and details effective flooding methods to put out underground fires. It also highlights how modern tools—such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and satellite data—can be used to detect and monitor fires more accurately and safely.

These technologies are especially important when dealing with so-called “zombie fires.” These are fires that can continue smoldering in peat through the cold season and reignite when conditions become warmer and drier. As the climate changes, these zombie fires are becoming a more serious threat, feeding into a dangerous cycle: drier conditions and higher temperatures make peatlands more vulnerable to burning, and the resulting fires release even more greenhouse gases, further accelerating climate change.

But technology and response capacity are only part of the solution. Most wildfires, including many peat fires, are caused by human activities. That means prevention is critical. Avoiding activities that can spark fires, protecting peatlands from drainage and degradation, and treating fire risk as a serious, ongoing concern are all essential steps. Simply reacting to fires after they start is not enough.

The work of Greenpeace Russia, and volunteers like Alexi, shows how combining science, on-the-ground experience, and advanced monitoring tools can make a real difference in confronting peat fires. Their efforts underline a clear message: to protect peatlands, safeguard biodiversity, and slow the pace of global warming, society must focus on preventing human-caused fires and using every available tool to stop those that do break out from turning into long-lasting climate disasters.
