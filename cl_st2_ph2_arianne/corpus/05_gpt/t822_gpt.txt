In 2017, the murders of Wixárika leaders Miguel Vázquez and his brother Agustín Torres in Mexico exposed a brutal reality: Indigenous communities on the frontlines of environmental defense are paying with their lives for protecting their lands. Both men were part of a long struggle to reclaim ancestral territory from ranchers and drug cartels, confronting powerful economic and criminal interests in a context of government inaction. Their deaths are not isolated events, but part of a wider pattern of violence against Indigenous land defenders around the world.

The Wixárika people, like many Indigenous nations, are fighting not only for land, but for a way of life rooted in respect for nature and community. When governments fail to uphold their rights, or actively side with those who seek to exploit their territories, Indigenous leaders are left exposed. The murders of Vázquez and Torres underscore how dangerous it is to stand up to those who profit from dispossession and environmental destruction.

This violence is mirrored in many places. In Brazil, the Guarani and Kaiowa peoples have faced systematic aggression as they defend their territories from loggers and other invaders. Their lands are targeted for agribusiness expansion and resource extraction, and they endure threats, attacks, and forced displacement. Despite this, they continue to resist, asserting their right to live on and care for their ancestral territories.

In Ecuador, Indigenous tribes have taken their struggle into the courts, suing Chevron over massive oil contamination in the Amazon. Their legal battle is a response to decades of pollution that has poisoned rivers, forests, and communities, leaving a legacy of illness and environmental devastation. By holding a multinational corporation accountable, these communities are challenging a global economic model that treats their homelands as sacrifice zones.

There are also examples of Indigenous resistance achieving concrete victories. In Argentina, the Wichi and Guarani peoples successfully campaigned together with Greenpeace to stop deforestation driven by soy plantations. Their efforts protected forests that are essential for their survival and culture, and that are vital for biodiversity and climate stability. This collaboration shows that when Indigenous communities and allies join forces, it is possible to push back against powerful interests and defend nature.

Across these struggles runs a common thread: globalization has failed to bring justice or well-being to Indigenous peoples. Instead, it has often deepened inequality, intensified land grabs, and accelerated environmental destruction. Global markets demand ever more land for cattle, soy, timber, oil, and minerals, while the communities who have cared for these territories for generations are pushed aside, criminalized, or killed.

Yet Indigenous peoples are among the most effective guardians of the Earth’s remaining biodiversity. Their territories contain many of the world’s healthiest ecosystems, not by accident, but because their cultures and governance systems are built around balance, reciprocity, and long-term stewardship. When their rights are violated, it is not only an injustice against specific communities; it is also a direct attack on the forests, rivers, and species that all life depends on.

In 2015, Indigenous leaders from around the world issued a stark warning about the state of the planet, declaring that the Earth was being degraded and calling for a fundamental change in how humanity relates to nature. Their statement emphasized that the crises we face are the result of a broken relationship with the Earth, and that solutions must be grounded in respect for Indigenous rights, knowledge, and leadership.

The stories of the Wixárika, the Guarani and Kaiowa, the Ecuadorian tribes challenging Chevron, and the Wichi and Guarani in Argentina all point in the same direction. Defending Indigenous rights is inseparable from defending the climate and biodiversity. As long as governments fail to protect Indigenous communities and continue to prioritize short-term profit over life, violence and environmental destruction will continue.

Honouring the memory of leaders like Miguel Vázquez and Agustín Torres means more than mourning their deaths. It means listening to Indigenous voices, supporting their struggles, and recognizing that their fight to protect ancestral lands is a fight for the future of the Earth itself.
