Greenpeace’s ship Esperanza is sailing through the Gulf of California to document how toxic agricultural chemicals are affecting the environment and people’s health. Along this route, activists are drawing attention to the role of major food companies such as Bimbo, La Costeña, and Herdez, which rely on production systems that use harmful fertilizers and pesticides. These chemicals end up in rivers, soils, and coastal waters, with serious consequences for communities and ecosystems.

Sinaloa, a key focus of this tour, is at the center of Mexico’s industrial agriculture model. The state produces 38% of the country’s vegetables and is also a national leader in grain production. This intensive output is tied to heavy pesticide use. While these chemicals are applied to protect crops, they also contaminate the environment and enter the food chain. A striking example of the regulatory gap is that 29 pesticides currently allowed in Mexico are banned in other countries, underscoring the urgency of stricter controls and safer alternatives.

The scale of chemical use in Mexico is enormous. In 2012 alone, 120,000 tons of pesticides and 2 million tons of fertilizers were applied across 22 million hectares of farmland. This dependence on agrochemicals has multiple impacts: soils become polluted and lose health over time, food can carry residues that reach consumers’ tables, and runoff washes fertilizers and pesticides into rivers and, ultimately, the sea.

In the Gulf of California, this runoff is damaging coastal ecosystems. Excess nutrients from fertilizers can trigger algal blooms, which disrupt marine food webs and threaten biodiversity. These blooms degrade water quality and can affect fisheries and coastal livelihoods that depend on a healthy marine environment.

To confront this situation, Greenpeace and the UCCS (Union de Científicos Comprometidos con la Sociedad) are working together to document the impacts of toxic agricultural chemicals in the region. By gathering evidence from the field, they are pressing authorities and companies to move away from this harmful model and commit to sustainable, organic farming practices. Such a shift is essential to protect soils and water, reduce contamination in food, and safeguard the Gulf of California’s fragile coastal ecosystems.
