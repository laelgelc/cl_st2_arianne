COVID-19 has laid bare how fragile and unequal our consumption-driven economies really are. When global supply chains faltered and shops closed, it became obvious how deeply our lives depend on a constant flow of extracted resources, manufactured products, and shipped goods. The pandemic has forced a reckoning with the way we treat nature as an endless warehouse and waste bin, and with an economic model that only feels “healthy” when consumption is rising.

For years, recycling has been held up as the main solution to our waste crisis. But recycling is often inefficient, energy-intensive, and incapable of dealing with the sheer volume of materials that a growth-obsessed system churns out. It can become a convenient distraction from the harder, more transformative work of producing and consuming less in the first place. As long as we keep expanding production, even perfect recycling would struggle to keep up.

A truly sustainable path demands a shift in priorities: from recycling at the end of a product’s life to refusing and reducing at the beginning. That means questioning whether products need to exist at all, cutting unnecessary consumption, and designing things to last, be repaired, and be shared. Instead of a fast, high-throughput circular economy that tries to keep growth intact, we need a “slow circular economy” that reduces the total flow of materials and energy.

In a slow circular economy, design is central. Products are simple, repairable, durable, and modular. They are made from local, renewable, non-toxic resources, so that communities are less dependent on long, fragile supply chains and harmful extraction. Materials are chosen not just for performance and cost, but for how safely and easily they can be reused or returned to nature. This approach treats waste as a design failure, not an inevitable by-product.

Such a shift directly challenges the way many corporations currently talk about sustainability. Corporate circularity strategies often focus narrowly on recycling and recycled content, while leaving the core business model of ever-expanding production and sales untouched. Recycling becomes a way to justify more growth: “green” packaging, “eco” collections, and “circular” product lines that still rely on high turnover and planned obsolescence. The pandemic has shown how risky it is to cling to this model, both for people and for ecosystems.

At the same time, new practices are emerging that point in a different direction. Repair incentives encourage people to fix what they own rather than replace it. Limits on advertising can help reduce the constant pressure to buy more, newer, and faster. Alternative economic models are being tested that value sufficiency, sharing, and care over throughput and profit. These experiments show that it is possible to organize economic life around meeting needs within ecological limits, instead of maximizing consumption.

To make these changes real and lasting, transparency is essential. We need clear information about how products are made, what they are made from, and under what conditions. This allows people and communities to choose options that align with circular principles and to hold companies and governments to account. Localization is equally important: shorter supply chains, regional production, and community-level solutions reduce vulnerability and reconnect economies with the ecosystems that sustain them.

Ultimately, circularity cannot be confined to product design or waste management. Circular principles must be woven into social and financial systems as well. That means aligning investment, taxation, and social protections with goals like durability, repair, and reduced throughput, rather than with endless expansion. It means building institutions and norms that reward care, maintenance, and regeneration instead of extraction and disposability.

COVID-19 has exposed the cracks in business-as-usual and reminded us of our deep dependence on healthy ecosystems. Clinging to recycling as a fix for overproduction will not be enough. A slow circular economy—rooted in refusing, reducing, redesigning, and relocalizing—offers a pathway toward genuine sustainability and resilience, if we are willing to rethink what progress really means.
