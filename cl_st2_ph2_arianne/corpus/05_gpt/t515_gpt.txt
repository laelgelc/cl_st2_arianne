This week, Greenpeace activists and supporters took action in supermarkets and shops around the world – from Colombia to Hong Kong, Canada to Switzerland – to send a clear message to major retailers: it’s time to end the era of single-use plastics and invest in real solutions based on refill and reuse.

Across countries and continents, people demonstrated outside stores, organized in‑store protests, and delivered petitions demanding that retailers stop flooding shelves with throwaway packaging. The call was simple and urgent: there is no “away” when it comes to throwaway items. Every plastic bag, wrapper, sachet and bottle discarded “out of sight” still exists somewhere – in landfills, incinerators, rivers, and oceans, or in the communities living closest to waste and pollution.

These actions are part of a growing global movement known as the Reuse Revolution. All over the world, people are already changing how they shop and live by replacing single-use plastics with reusable options. More than 5 million people have joined together to urge companies and governments to act decisively against plastic pollution, and their message is resonating far beyond individual consumer choices. They are calling for systemic change.

Yet many companies continue to push false solutions. Instead of redesigning their business models around reuse, they swap one disposable material for another – replacing plastic with paper or bioplastics – or rely on recycling systems that are deeply flawed and unable to cope with the sheer volume of waste. These approaches keep the throwaway culture intact and fail to address the root of the problem: the overproduction and overconsumption of single-use items.

Retailers have a crucial role to play in turning this around. They can choose to remove single-use plastics from their shelves, commit to refill and reuse systems, and use their influence to drive change across the brands they sell. By redesigning packaging, expanding refill options, and supporting reuse infrastructure, retailers can help shift the entire system away from disposability.

The Reuse Revolution is already underway, led by millions of people who refuse to accept a future buried in plastic. Retailers and brands must now catch up with the public’s demand for real, lasting solutions. Join the growing call for change and be part of the #ReuseRevolution.
