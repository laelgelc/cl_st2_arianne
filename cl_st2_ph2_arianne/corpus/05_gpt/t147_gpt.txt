At the Global Fashion Summit in Copenhagen, ultra-fast fashion giant Shein announced a $15 million donation to a Ghanaian NGO that supports people working in textile waste. The money is intended to help those dealing with the mounting piles of discarded clothing, much of it shipped from the Global North and often linked to fast fashion brands.

Greenpeace Germany campaigner Viola Wohlgemuth is clear that this move, while sizeable on paper, does not address the root of the problem. Without changing Shein’s underlying business model, the donation amounts to greenwashing: a public relations gesture that distracts from the ongoing harm caused by ultra-fast fashion.

Shein’s model is built on producing huge volumes of ultra-cheap, disposable clothing. These items are designed and marketed for rapid turnover: bought on impulse, worn only a few times (if at all), and then quickly discarded. This approach wastes enormous amounts of resources and is tied to the exploitation of both people and the environment across global supply chains.

The problems don’t end at the checkout. Many returned items are not resold or reused—they are landfilled or otherwise disposed of, adding to the growing wave of textile waste. Greenpeace research in Kenya and Tanzania has documented how discarded clothes are piling up in dumps, clogging rivers and polluting the sea. These findings mirror what is happening in Ghana, where textile waste is overwhelming local waste systems and harming communities and ecosystems.

In this context, a one-off or time-limited donation does not come close to addressing the scale of the damage. For Greenpeace, companies like Shein must be held to the “Polluter Pays” principle: those responsible for environmental harm should bear the costs of the damage they cause, globally, not just where it becomes most visible.

Applying this principle means going far beyond philanthropy. It requires a fundamental shift away from an ultra-fast fashion model that treats clothes as disposable. Brands should drastically reduce the volume of new items they produce and focus on making fewer garments that are durable, repairable and long-lasting.

This also means investing in true circular services that keep clothing in use for as long as possible—through repair, reuse and other systems that preserve resources instead of burning through them. Only by transforming their core business models in this way can ultra-fast fashion companies begin to address the environmental and social destruction their current practices are causing, from Ghana to East Africa and beyond.
