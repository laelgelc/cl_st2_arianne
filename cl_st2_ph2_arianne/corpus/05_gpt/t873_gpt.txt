In the mid-1970s, Shell installed a massive offshore oil storage and loading buoy in the North Sea: the Brent Spar. Built in 1976 to support oil production from the Brent field, the structure was designed as a floating storage tank. Just a few years later, by 1980, it had already become redundant. What remained inside was deeply troubling: residues of crude oil, PCBs, heavy metals, and radioactive waste.

By the early 1990s, Shell was looking for a way to dispose of this obsolete structure. In 1991, the company proposed a solution that would become infamous: towing the Brent Spar out to deep water and dumping it in the North Sea. The plan was pitched as a cost-saving measure and a test case that could set a precedent for how other offshore installations might be dealt with in the future. The UK government approved the proposal, clearing the way for deep-sea disposal.

It was at this point that Greenpeace intervened. In 1995, as Shell prepared to carry out the dumping, Greenpeace launched a high-profile campaign to stop it. Activists occupied the Brent Spar itself, turning the remote structure into a frontline of environmental protest. They took samples of the contents on board, highlighting that the spar still contained crude oil and hazardous substances like PCBs, heavy metals, and radioactive waste. 

On land and at sea, the message was clear and simple: “The sea is not a dustbin.” This slogan captured the core of the campaign and spread rapidly through media coverage across Europe and beyond. Public concern grew, and the campaign quickly escalated. Boycotts of Shell products took hold in several countries, and mounting international pressure put Shell’s disposal plan under intense scrutiny.

As the protests continued and the reputational and political costs rose, Shell ultimately reversed its decision. Instead of being sunk in the North Sea, the Brent Spar was towed to Norway and moored there. This reversal marked a major turning point. What began as a single disposal decision had become a global debate about how the offshore oil industry should handle its obsolete infrastructure.

The impact of the Brent Spar campaign went far beyond a single structure. In 1998, countries around the North-East Atlantic adopted a ban under the OSPAR convention on dumping such installations in the North Sea. The Brent Spar had become a catalyst for stronger regional rules, closing the door on the kind of deep-sea disposal Shell had originally planned.

The story did not end with the spar rusting away in a Norwegian fjord. Instead, the structure was eventually repurposed: its remains were used as the foundation for a ferry terminal. What had once been intended for abandonment on the seabed became part of public infrastructure on land.

From its construction in 1976, through redundancy in 1980, to the attempted dumping in 1991 and the protests of 1995, the Brent Spar’s journey reflects a shift in how society views the oceans and industrial responsibility. The campaign’s outcome—Shell’s reversal, the 1998 OSPAR dumping ban, and the spar’s eventual reuse—stands as a pivotal Greenpeace victory and a defining moment in the struggle to keep the sea from being treated as a dumping ground.
