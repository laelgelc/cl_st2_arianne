Fifty years ago, a simple piece of advice set a course for a lifetime of activism: “Be organized.” It wasn’t a corporate slogan or a call for tidy desks. It was a quiet, practical secret from mentor Ira Sandperl about how real change happens: with intention, discipline, and care.

Looking back over decades of campaigns, movements, and crises, that advice still holds. Being organized isn’t just about logistics. It means organizing our minds, our communities, our stories, and even our inner lives so we can respond to a world in ecological and social turmoil.

At the heart of this work is a commitment to seeking truth. That means doing the hard, sometimes uncomfortable research instead of relying on what we already believe or what our peers repeat. Echo chambers and confirmation bias are temptations in every movement, including environmental ones. When we only listen to ideas that echo our own, we stop learning, and our strategies grow brittle.

To avoid that trap, we need a deep diversity of ideas. Not just demographic diversity—though that matters—but diversity of perspectives, disciplines, and worldviews. When people from different backgrounds and with different experiences are truly included, creativity flourishes. New solutions emerge. Old assumptions are challenged. Movements become more resilient.

Deep ecology offers another essential lens. Rather than seeing nature as a backdrop or a resource bank, deep ecology asks us to study how nature actually works—and to recognize that we are part of these living systems, not outside them. Forests, oceans, soil, and climate are not separate issues; they are intertwined expressions of a single, complex Earth community. Understanding that complexity helps us see why quick technological fixes or isolated policies are never enough on their own.

From that perspective, solutions naturally begin to localize. Real change takes root in communities that understand their own ecosystems—their watersheds, soils, food systems, and social networks. Local self-reliance is not isolationism; it’s about building the capacity to meet basic needs close to home, with respect for local conditions and limits. When communities organize around their own places, they become less vulnerable to distant shocks and more able to care for each other and their environments.

This local focus is especially important when confronting overshoot—the deeper crisis beneath climate change. Overshoot means we are consuming more energy and materials than Earth can regenerate, year after year. Climate disruption is one symptom of that deeper imbalance. Addressing overshoot requires more than cleaner energy; it requires less consumption. That’s a hard message in consumer societies, but it’s unavoidable. Any honest path forward will involve learning to live with fewer material goods and less waste, while strengthening what actually makes life meaningful: relationships, creativity, health, and community.

Communication, in this context, is not just about sharing facts. It’s about stories. Our cultures are shaped by powerful myths: endless growth, human dominance over nature, the idea that technology alone will save us. Effective activism uses narrative to gently but firmly disrupt these myths and to offer new ones—stories of interdependence, limits, care, and shared responsibility. When people can see themselves inside a different story, change becomes imaginable.

None of this is purely external work. Personal growth is part of organizing. Self-examination helps us notice where our own egos get in the way—when we cling to being right, to being praised, or to being in control. Quieting the ego doesn’t mean becoming passive; it means acting from a deeper place than vanity or fear. Movements rooted in that kind of humility are harder to divide, co-opt, or discourage.

“Be organized” then becomes a much broader invitation. Organize your research so you are always learning. Organize your community so many voices can contribute. Organize your understanding of nature so your actions align with how life actually functions. Organize your consumption so it respects planetary limits. Organize your stories so they challenge destructive myths. And organize your inner life so your actions grow from clarity rather than ego.

Half a century of activism suggests that when these layers come together—truth-seeking, deep diversity, ecology, localization, reduced consumption, narrative, and inner work—our movements become not just louder, but wiser. And wisdom is what this moment demands.
