Across the world, governments and communities are taking concrete steps to tackle plastic pollution by banning some of the most harmful and unnecessary plastic products. These measures are a response to the mounting evidence that plastic waste is choking our oceans, harming marine life and contaminating ecosystems.

In Europe, France has banned thin single-use plastic bags as part of a wider European Union effort to reduce plastic waste. These bags are typically used for just a few minutes but can persist in the environment for decades, making them a key target for legislation aimed at cutting pollution at the source.

On the African continent, Morocco has gone further by implementing a comprehensive ban on plastic bags. This ban covers the production, import, sale and distribution of plastic bags across the country. The move has not been without challenges: some businesses and individuals have resisted the law by stockpiling plastic bags. Even so, the policy represents a significant step towards reducing the volume of plastic entering landfills and the natural environment.

Ethiopia has also taken action, introducing a ban in 2011 that is tied to the country’s broader green energy ambitions. Linking plastic reduction with a wider sustainability agenda shows how environmental policies can reinforce each other and help shift countries onto a more sustainable development path.

In India, the state of Karnataka has introduced one of the more wide-ranging plastic bans. The state has prohibited various plastic products, including bags, plates and microbeads. Enforcement has been active: authorities have seized 39,000 kilograms of illegal plastic, demonstrating both the scale of the problem and the seriousness of the response.

Some of the earliest and most visible plastic restrictions have come from cities. San Francisco has been a pioneer, banning plastic bags as early as 2007. In 2014, the city expanded its efforts by banning plastic water bottles, and it has also banned styrofoam, a material that is notoriously difficult to recycle. These measures show how local policies can lead the way, proving what is possible and inspiring other jurisdictions to follow.

Other cities and regions have acted too. Honolulu introduced a plastic bag ban in 2015, aiming to cut the flow of plastic into the Pacific Ocean. In Australia, Tasmania began addressing plastic bag use in 2003, reducing an estimated 350,000 bags and demonstrating that even early, targeted actions can prevent large amounts of waste from entering the environment.

All of these bans share a common goal: to stop plastic pollution before it reaches rivers, coasts and oceans. Plastic waste in the ocean is a serious threat to marine life. Animals can become entangled in discarded bags, mistake plastic fragments for food, or suffer from the toxic effects of microplastics. Once in the marine environment, plastics are extremely difficult to remove, making prevention essential.

These examples from France, Morocco, Ethiopia, India, San Francisco, Honolulu and Tasmania show that change is not only necessary, but already underway. Governments and communities are proving that it is possible to curb plastic use and reduce pollution through targeted bans and strong enforcement.

To build on this momentum and protect our oceans, Greenpeace is calling on people everywhere to join the Plastics Pledge. By committing to reduce plastic use and support policies that phase out unnecessary plastics, individuals can help ensure that these pioneering bans are just the beginning of a much bigger global shift away from throwaway plastics and towards a cleaner, safer future for our planet and its oceans.
