In conversation with Yewande Omotoso to mark South African Women’s Day, Pregs Govender reflects on how storytelling and activism are deeply intertwined in her life. She traces this connection back to her father, whose influence helped her understand the importance of owning one’s narrative. For Govender, telling our own stories is not just a personal act, but a political one: it determines whose experiences are seen, whose knowledge is valued, and whose struggles are remembered.

Govender points to the way Indigenous Peoples care for and protect the Earth as a powerful example of this. Their practices and wisdom are central to sustaining life, yet their contributions are often overlooked or erased. She stresses that when these stories are sidelined, so too are the people and the ecological knowledge that could help guide us toward more just and sustainable futures.

In sharing memories of her mother, Govender offers another layer to this lineage of care. She recalls her mother’s recycling practices and ancestral knowledge, drawing a line between everyday acts in the home and broader traditions of environmental stewardship. These personal recollections resonate with the work of Wangari Maathai, whose leadership in environmental protection and women’s empowerment similarly rooted political action in lived experience, community, and care for the land.

Throughout the interview, Govender is sharply critical of the global racist, capitalist, patriarchal system that shapes so much of our world. She describes how billionaires exploit this system, concentrating wealth and power while deepening inequality and environmental harm. Against this backdrop, she calls for resistance that is grounded not in hatred but in love and courage.

For Govender, reclaiming our interconnectedness is central to that resistance. She argues that power hierarchies deliberately fragment us—separating people from each other, communities from their histories, and humans from the Earth. By insisting on connection instead of fragmentation, and by centring the stories and knowledge of those who protect the planet, she believes we can challenge the forces that seek to divide and dominate.
