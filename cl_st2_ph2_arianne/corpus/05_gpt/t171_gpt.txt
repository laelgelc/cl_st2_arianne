Across the world, people are taking to the streets and online platforms to demand something very basic yet still out of reach for millions: the right to breathe clean air.

Air pollution is causing serious health problems everywhere, contributing to asthma, heart disease, and stroke. There is no safe level of exposure. Yet in cities across the globe, residents are forced to inhale toxic air every single day, often without even knowing how dangerous it is.

During World Health Day week, from April 7–10, citizens in many countries rallied under the shared call for #CleanAirNOW. Their message was clear: clean air cannot wait, and solutions must be tailored to local realities. People are demanding measures such as dedicated bus lanes to make public transport faster and more attractive, upgraded PM2.5 standards that reflect the best available science, and stronger regulations to tackle transboundary haze that drifts across borders and chokes entire regions.

These demands come as the World Health Organization has strengthened its air quality guidelines, reflecting mounting evidence of the harm caused by even low levels of pollution. Yet, according to IQAir’s 2021 report, 97% of cities failed to meet these tougher standards. That figure is especially alarming given that it is based on incomplete data: in many places, air quality monitoring is limited or absent, leaving communities in the dark about the air they breathe.

The solutions are well known. Governments must move away from fossil fuels and rapidly adopt clean energy, while redesigning cities around equitable, low-carbon mobility. That means investing in public transport that is affordable and reliable, and making it easier and safer for people to walk and cycle. These changes tackle both the air pollution crisis and the climate crisis at the same time.

The global movement for clean air is growing, but it needs more voices and more pressure on decision-makers. You can help by signing the petition to phase out fossil fuels and by joining the movement calling for #CleanAirNOW.
