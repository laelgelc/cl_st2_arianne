On 21 March, the International Day of Forests is a reminder that forests are essential to life on Earth – and that they are under threat. Around the world, people are coming together to defend forests and the communities and species that depend on them, while also challenging one of the biggest drivers of destruction: industrial meat.

Forests store carbon, regulate water, shelter wildlife and support Indigenous Peoples and local communities. Yet 80% of the world’s forests are now degraded. One powerful way individuals can help is by reducing meat consumption. Industrial meat production drives deforestation for cattle ranching and animal feed, destroying forest ecosystems and accelerating climate change. Choosing more plant-based foods and less meat is a direct way to ease the pressure on forests.

At the same time, people-powered movements are confronting forest threats on the ground. In Tasmania, climate-driven fires have torn through ancient forests, damaging ecosystems that have existed for millennia. These fires show how the climate crisis is already reshaping some of the world’s most unique forest landscapes.

In the Amazon, a proposed mega-dam on the Tapajós River threatens both the forest and the Munduruku Indigenous People, whose lives, culture and territories are closely tied to the river and surrounding rainforest. Resistance to the dam is a fight for Indigenous rights and for the future of one of the planet’s most important forest regions.

In China, illegal logging is putting giant pandas at risk by eroding their forest habitat. In response, protective strategies have been developed to defend these forests, helping safeguard one of the world’s most iconic and vulnerable species.

In Argentina, plans for oil drilling in Calilegua National Park have been canceled, protecting a precious forest area and the biodiversity it holds. This decision shows that fossil fuel expansion in protected forest areas can be stopped.

In the Congo Basin, one of the largest tropical forest regions on Earth, there are strong calls to maintain a logging moratorium. Keeping this moratorium in place is crucial to prevent further large-scale forest loss and to protect communities and wildlife that rely on the forest.

In Indonesia, forests continue to fall for palm oil plantations. This deforestation destroys habitats, contributes to climate change and undermines the rights and livelihoods of local people. Campaigns are pushing for an end to forest destruction for palm oil and for stronger protections for remaining forests.

In Canada, 85% of the Great Bear Rainforest has been placed under protection, a major achievement for one of the world’s most remarkable temperate rainforests. This outcome reflects years of work by Indigenous Nations, local communities and allies to secure a future for the forest and the species that live there.

In the Amazon again, cattle ranching remains a major driver of deforestation. People are demanding an end to forest destruction linked to cattle, calling for supply chains that do not rely on clearing rainforest for pasture.

These eight struggles, spread across the globe, share a common thread: when people organize and speak out, forests can be defended. On this International Day of Forests, reducing meat consumption, supporting forest protection campaigns and standing with Indigenous Peoples and local communities are all ways to help.

Everyone is invited to celebrate forests – by enjoying time among trees, sharing stories and photos of the forests that matter to you, and spreading the word about why they need protection. Forests are vital, irreplaceable and worth every effort to defend.
