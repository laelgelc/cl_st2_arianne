As the World Cup drew the world’s attention to Russia’s host cities, Greenpeace Russia set out to understand what was being done to tackle one of the most pressing local issues: air pollution. The focus of the survey was clear and concrete—what measures are city authorities taking, especially on vehicle emissions, which residents see as the primary source of dirty air?

The results revealed both serious concern from residents and a mixed record of action from city governments. In major cities, dissatisfaction with air quality was overwhelming: 82% of residents in Moscow, 77% in St. Petersburg, and 60% in Kazan expressed unhappiness with the state of the air they breathe. For many people living in these cities, the problem of pollution is not abstract—it is part of daily life.

At the same time, the survey identified a number of positive steps. Moscow has introduced restrictions on low-emission vehicles, expanded its network of electric vehicle charging stations, and developed bike paths, all of which can help reduce traffic-related emissions. St. Petersburg is moving toward cleaner transport as well, investing in electric public transport and improving its cycling infrastructure. In Rostov-on-Don, local activists and experts are challenging the idea that simply expanding road networks is a solution, raising critical questions about car dependency and congestion. Yekaterinburg has also begun to offer more sustainable transport options, signaling that alternatives to polluting vehicles are both possible and practical.

But the picture is far from uniformly encouraging. In Samara and Volgograd, the survey found a lack of serious action to address air pollution. Sochi went further by rejecting recommendations aimed at improving air quality. Nizhny Novgorod and Saransk did not respond to the survey at all, leaving residents and campaigners without clear information on what, if anything, is being done.

Greenpeace Russia’s goal in conducting this survey is not only to document the situation but to ensure that authorities are held accountable for protecting public health and the environment. The organization plans to use these findings to push city governments to do more—and to do it faster.

This work depends on public involvement. People living in these cities, and across Russia, are being urged to join the clean air movement: to demand effective measures from local authorities, support sustainable transport, and stand up for their right to breathe clean air.
