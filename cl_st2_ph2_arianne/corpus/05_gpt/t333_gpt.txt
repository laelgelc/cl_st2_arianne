In the forests of the Muonio Sámi district, reindeer herder Katarina Sevä is watching a centuries-old way of life come under increasing pressure. Her family has practiced forest reindeer herding for generations, relying on large, continuous grazing areas and intact old forests where hanging lichen provides crucial winter food for the reindeer.

That foundation is being eroded by extensive logging. When forests are cut, the grazing land shrinks and the vital hanging lichen disappears. The consequences are visible directly on the animals: reindeer are developing poorer antlers, their body weight is lower, and their behavior is changing as they are forced to search further and harder for food. What had been a resilient, finely tuned system between people, reindeer, and forest is becoming more fragile.

State-owned forestry company Sveaskog plays a central role in this development. According to Sevä, the company has unilaterally ended the long-standing consultations that are essential for coordinating logging with reindeer herding needs, without offering any explanation. Objections from herders are ignored. Important grazing areas are logged, including places that had previously been agreed to be protected. New forest roads are built, but the company does not provide maps, making it harder for herders to plan and adapt their use of the land.

For Sámi reindeer herders, these consultations are not a formality; they are a basic tool to prevent irreversible damage to their livelihoods. Sevä and others have demanded that consultations be resumed and that key forest areas be preserved so that reindeer husbandry can continue into the future. So far, those demands have not been met.

In response, there is now a clear and urgent call: all logging in the Muonio Sámi district should be halted until meaningful talks are restarted. Only with renewed dialogue and real protection of critical grazing forests can the future of reindeer husbandry in this area be secured.
