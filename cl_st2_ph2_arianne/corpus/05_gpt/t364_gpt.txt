Mexico’s presidential decree of December 31, 2020 marks a historic step toward food sovereignty and environmental protection. The decision to prohibit transgenic corn and to phase out glyphosate by 2024 responds to a clear objective: to build sustainable agri-food systems that produce healthy food while respecting ecosystems.

For Greenpeace Mexico, this achievement is the result of 21 years of continuous advocacy in alliance with multiple social, peasant, scientific and environmental groups. Together, these efforts have pushed back against the advance of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and the widespread use of glyphosate, both of which have been linked to health risks, ecosystem contamination and serious threats to agricultural diversity.

The decree establishes that glyphosate will no longer be used in government programs, and that genetically modified corn will be excluded from the Mexican diet, at least until truly sustainable alternatives are in place. This is not only a regulatory change; it is a signal of a broader transformation in how food is produced, distributed and consumed in the country.

Mexico is the center of origin and diversification of corn, with 59 recognized types, as well as many other culturally and nutritionally important crops. This immense agricultural and cultural heritage is at risk when GMOs and agrochemicals enter the fields and food chains, potentially contaminating native varieties and undermining the resilience that peasant and Indigenous communities have built over generations.

Protecting this biodiversity requires a decisive shift toward ecological agriculture. The decree points in that direction by recognizing the need to move away from dependence on pesticides and GMOs and toward production models that care for the soil, water, seeds and the health of rural communities and consumers.

Greenpeace Mexico underscores that the goal must be a pesticide- and GMO-free agricultural system, where seeds are not privatized but remain in the hands of the communities that have conserved and improved them over centuries. This is essential to guarantee real food sovereignty: the right of peoples to define their own food and agriculture systems, based on local knowledge, biodiversity and social and environmental justice.

The path ahead involves deepening support for ecological practices, strengthening public policies that favor agroecology, and ensuring that the protections established in the decree are fully implemented. With this step, Mexico is defending not only its corn and its fields, but also its cultural heritage and the possibility of a healthier, more just and sustainable future.
