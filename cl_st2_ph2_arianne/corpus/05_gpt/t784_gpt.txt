After 25 years of studying Antarctic marine life, Dr. Susanne Lockhart is finally seeing the corals and sponges she has long researched in their natural home. Working as an Antarctic biologist aboard the Greenpeace ship Arctic Sunrise, she describes the moment with clear excitement: being able to observe these cold‑water corals and sponges alive on the seafloor of the Antarctic Ocean.

These corals and sponges don’t just sit on the bottom; they build complex three-dimensional structures that are vital to life in the surrounding waters. Their intricate forms create habitat and shelter, supporting a rich web of species that includes fish, penguins, seals, and whales. In these fragile, icy depths, they are the foundations of entire ecosystems.

To better understand and protect these habitats, Dr. Lockhart is taking part in submarine expeditions from the Arctic Sunrise. From inside the sub, she documents the seafloor with cameras and collects carefully chosen specimens. Among them may be species that science has never described before. Each image and sample helps build a clearer picture of what lives in these remote waters and how these communities function.

Her focus is on identifying what are known as Vulnerable Marine Ecosystems – places where unique, slow‑growing, and sensitive life forms are especially at risk from human activity. The photographic evidence and specimens gathered on these dives will be submitted to the Commission for the Antarctic Ocean. This body will use the data to assess and support proposals for what would become the world’s largest marine protected area.

Such a protected area is urgently needed as commercial fishing pushes further into the Antarctic Ocean. The expansion of industrial activity into these once largely untouched waters threatens the very ecosystems Dr. Lockhart is documenting. By bringing back proof of the extraordinary life on the Antarctic seafloor, she is helping to build the scientific case for strong protection, so that the cold‑water corals, sponges, and all the species that depend on them can continue to thrive.
