A decade after the Rana Plaza factory collapse in Bangladesh killed 1,134 garment workers, the fashion industry remains a powerful symbol of how cheaply human lives and the environment are still treated. The images and testimonies from that disaster continue to haunt anyone who has ever bought a T-shirt for the price of a coffee. They stand as a stark reminder that fast fashion’s low prices are paid elsewhere – in unsafe factories, polluted rivers, and mountains of discarded clothing.

Those mountains are not just an abstract idea. They are visible, tangible, and overwhelming in places like Kenya, where clothes that were once sold as “must-have” trends in the Global North end up as waste. In markets and dumpsites there, you can see the end point of the fashion system: bales of used clothing, much of it too low-quality to be worn again, piling up faster than it can be reused or recycled. It is a confronting reality that exposes the brutal truth behind the industry’s business model: overproduction, overconsumption, and a global chain of exploitation that treats both people and the planet as disposable.

Instead of changing that model, many fashion brands have chosen to change their marketing. Buzzwords like “Sustainable”, “Green”, “Eco” and “Conscious” are now everywhere – on hangtags, in online product descriptions, and in glossy advertising campaigns. These labels suggest that buying more clothes can somehow be part of the solution, that consumption can be “guilt-free” if the right words are attached.

A new Greenpeace report cuts through this illusion. It finds that most of these environmental claims are unsubstantiated – vague, unverifiable, or simply not backed up by evidence. What is presented as a transformation of the industry often turns out to be little more than a transformation of language. This is greenwashing: using the appearance of responsibility to distract from the reality of a wasteful, polluting system.

Yet there are signs that genuine change is possible when companies move beyond slogans and start rethinking how clothes are made, sold, and used. Some brands are beginning to show what a more honest and responsible approach can look like. Vaude, Coop, Tchibo, H&M and Calzedonia are among those taking steps to improve traceability in their supply chains and to design products for greater durability.

Traceability means knowing where materials come from and how garments are produced, instead of hiding behind long, opaque supply chains. Durability means making clothes that are meant to last – to be worn, repaired, and kept in use – rather than falling apart after just a few washes. These may sound like basic principles, but in a system built on speed and volume, they represent a meaningful shift.

Greenpeace has seen before how public pressure can push the fashion industry to change. The Detox campaign, launched to eliminate toxic chemicals from textile production, showed that when brands are forced to confront the impact of their practices, they can act. Detox exposed how hazardous substances used in dyeing and finishing were contaminating rivers and ecosystems, and it demanded that companies commit to phasing them out. The campaign helped make toxic pollution in fashion a global issue and drove many brands to adopt stricter chemical management.

But tackling chemicals was only one piece of a much larger puzzle. The same logic that allowed toxic substances to be used so freely – a focus on cost-cutting, speed, and externalizing environmental damage – continues to drive overproduction and overconsumption today. Without addressing the sheer volume of clothes being made and discarded, any progress on safer materials or cleaner production will be undermined by the scale of waste.

True responsibility in fashion requires more than cleaner labels or a few “green” collections. It demands transparency from brands about how much they produce, where, and under what conditions. It requires systems that prioritize reuse, repair, and long life over constant novelty. And it means confronting the reality that a linear model – where resources are extracted, turned into products, briefly used, and then dumped – cannot be made “sustainable” simply by adding recycling bins or take-back schemes.

The promise of circularity is often invoked as the industry’s future, but too often it remains a buzzword rather than a practice. Real circularity would mean designing clothes to last, making it easy to repair and reuse them, and ensuring that when they can no longer be worn, they can be safely and effectively recycled. It would also mean producing far fewer new items in the first place. Without reducing overall production and waste, “circular” initiatives risk becoming just another layer of greenwashing.

The memories of Rana Plaza and the sight of clothes waste in places like Kenya make it impossible to ignore what is at stake. Behind every bargain garment is a chain of decisions about materials, labor, and profit that shape lives and landscapes across the world. The question is whether the industry will continue to hide behind empty claims and marketing spin, or whether it will finally accept that real change means slowing down, producing less, and valuing both workers and the environment.

Consumers, regulators, and civil society all have a role in pushing fashion in this direction, but the responsibility lies first and foremost with the brands that profit from the current system. They have the power to move beyond slogans, to embrace transparency, to invest in durability and traceability, and to help build a fashion industry that no longer leaves behind toxic rivers, collapsing factories, and mountains of waste.

Ten years after Rana Plaza, and with clothes waste piling up around the world, the choice is clear: cling to a broken linear model dressed up in “green” language, or commit to the hard work of transforming fashion into something truly circular, fair, and safe for people and the planet.
