When two young professionals in the United States decided to walk away from their high-paying, consumer-driven careers, they weren’t just decluttering their closets. Known today as The Minimalists, their choice to reject a life defined by possessions in favour of one centred on meaning and relationships helped popularise a modern movement: simple living and minimalism as a path to greater fulfillment.

Their story is part of a much longer lineage. Across centuries and cultures, people have questioned whether accumulating more stuff actually leads to better lives. Figures like St. Francis of Assisi and the Quakers embraced voluntary simplicity, seeing spiritual depth and community as more valuable than material wealth. Later, writers such as Henry David Thoreau and Leo Tolstoy explored how living with less could open space for reflection, integrity, and connection to nature. Mahatma Gandhi turned simplicity into a form of resistance, using modest living as a tool against injustice and excess.

In the 20th century, philosopher Arne Naess helped shape the deep ecology movement, arguing that humans are part of, not separate from, the natural world. His thinking influenced ecological movements, including Greenpeace and others that questioned a growth-at-all-costs mentality. This period also saw key books bring the idea of “less is more” into mainstream environmental conversations. Diet for a Small Planet linked our food choices and overconsumption to global inequities and ecological strain. Small Is Beautiful challenged the obsession with endless economic expansion, suggesting that smaller-scale, human-centred systems could be both fairer and more sustainable. Ecotopia imagined a future society organised around reduced consumption, localism, and ecological balance.

These modern voices echo much older traditions. Ancient teachings from Taoism and Buddhism emphasise letting go of attachment to possessions to find freedom and inner peace. The Cynic philosophers challenged social norms by living with radical simplicity. Accounts of the historical Jesus likewise present a life marked by renouncing wealth and status, suggesting that real richness comes from compassion, justice, and solidarity rather than ownership.

Indigenous cultures have long embodied these principles in practice. Ceremonies like the Potlatch, for example, centre on giving and sharing rather than hoarding. Status comes not from how much one accumulates, but from how much one gives away. This flips the logic of consumer culture on its head, proposing that a healthy community depends on reciprocity, generosity, and balance.

Today, as the world faces overlapping crises—including the climate emergency—these traditions of modest living and shared abundance offer more than moral inspiration. They point toward practical ways of organising our lives and societies around sufficiency instead of excess. By valuing relationships, community, and ecological balance over constant accumulation, simple living and minimalism become tools not just for personal fulfillment, but for confronting global challenges and imagining a more sustainable, equitable future.
