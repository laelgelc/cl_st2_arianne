For centuries, the Munduruku Indigenous People have lived along the Tapajós River in the Brazilian Amazon, depending on its waters and forests for food, transportation, and cultural practices. Today, more than 12,000 Munduruku people rely on this river system, and their struggle to defend it has become a frontline in the wider fight to protect the Amazon.

For over thirty years, the Munduruku have resisted industrial projects that threaten to transform their territory. One of the most significant of these threats was the São Luiz do Tapajós mega-dam, a project that would have flooded vast areas of forest and river, displacing communities and destroying habitats. With the support of Greenpeace and people around the world, that dam project was halted last year. Yet the pressure has not stopped: around 40 more dams are still planned across the Tapajós basin, putting biodiversity and traditional ways of life at risk.

In response, the Munduruku have taken their own powerful step to secure official recognition of their territory. Over two years, they collectively created what they call the “Map of Life.” This map is far more than a technical document. It records the places where they fish, hunt, gather food and medicines, and carry out spiritual and cultural practices. It shows how deeply their lives are intertwined with the forests, rivers, and animals of the Tapajós region, and how any large-scale flooding or disruption would affect not just land, but an entire living culture.

This week, the Munduruku brought that map directly to the political heart of Brazil. They joined 3,000 other Indigenous People in Brasília to demand protection of their territories and rights. Together, they delivered the “Map of Life” to the Ministry of Justice, calling for formal recognition of their lands and for an end to projects that would destroy them.

The impacts of dam-building in the Tapajós would be profound. Flooded forests would mean the loss of critical habitats and species, and the collapse of local fisheries and food sources. Communities that have lived along the river for generations would see their homes, sacred sites, and livelihoods submerged. These are not abstract risks; they are immediate threats to people and nature.

Around the world, more than 1.2 million people have already stood in solidarity with the Munduruku and other communities of the Tapajós, adding their names to petitions calling for the protection of this vital river system. Their support helped stop the São Luiz do Tapajós dam, and it continues to send a clear message: the rights of Indigenous Peoples and the integrity of the Amazon must not be sacrificed for destructive projects.

The Munduruku’s “Map of Life” is both a testament to their deep relationship with their territory and a demand to be heard. As they stand alongside thousands of other Indigenous People in Brasília, their message is simple and urgent: protect the Tapajós, recognize their land, and respect the communities who have safeguarded this part of the Amazon for generations.
