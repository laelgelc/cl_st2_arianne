Throwaway plastic is everywhere—from the packaging around our food to the bags we carry home and discard within minutes. But this convenience comes at a devastating cost. Single-use plastics are destroying our world by harming human health, accelerating social injustice, destroying biodiversity, and fueling the climate crisis.

From production to disposal, plastics are tied to fossil fuels. Oil and gas are extracted, transported, and refined to produce ever-growing volumes of plastic, locking us deeper into a system that heats the planet and destabilizes our climate. The same corporations that profit from fossil fuels are driving relentless plastic production, pushing more and more disposable products into our lives and our environment.

The impacts are not shared equally. Communities living near oil and gas fields, refineries, and plastic production plants bear the brunt of toxic pollution and environmental degradation. Waste is often exported or dumped into countries and communities with the least power to resist, deepening global inequalities and environmental racism. This is a crisis of justice as much as it is a crisis of pollution.

Plastic pollution also tears through ecosystems. Wildlife on land and at sea is choked, entangled, and poisoned by plastic waste. Habitats are contaminated by microplastics that are impossible to clean up, threatening biodiversity that we all depend on. At every stage, from extraction to incineration, plastics damage the natural systems that sustain life.

A human rights-based approach is essential to confronting this crisis. People have the right to a healthy environment, to clean air and water, and to live free from toxic harm. They have the right to participate in decisions that affect their lives and to seek justice when their rights are violated. Any real solution to the plastics crisis must prioritize health, the environment, and justice for the communities most affected.

This is why Greenpeace is calling for a strong, binding Global Plastics Treaty. Such a treaty must tackle the problem at its source: keeping oil and gas in the ground, ending the relentless expansion of plastic production, and phasing out single-use plastics. It must cap overall production, rapidly reduce the use of virgin plastics, and drive a just transition to a truly zero-waste economy.

A meaningful treaty cannot be limited to better waste management or recycling promises that have failed for decades. It must rein in corporate power, stop the flood of new plastics, and protect people and the planet over profit. It must recognize the rights and leadership of communities on the frontlines of pollution and climate impacts, and ensure that workers and communities are supported as economies shift away from fossil fuels and throwaway products.

Powerful industry interests and some governments are working to weaken the treaty, dilute its obligations, and delay real action. They promote false solutions that keep plastic production growing while shifting responsibility onto individuals and communities. These efforts threaten to lock the world into more pollution, more injustice, and more climate chaos.

But there is another path. Around the world, people are organizing to demand an ambitious Global Plastics Treaty by 2024—one that caps plastic production, phases out virgin plastics, and delivers a just transition to a zero-waste future. Building a strong, diverse global movement is essential to counter industry pressure and ensure that the treaty truly protects human rights, biodiversity, and the climate.

The choices made now will shape our shared future. Ending the era of throwaway plastic is not only about cleaning up trash; it is about defending health, advancing justice, protecting nature, and confronting the climate crisis at its roots. A bold Global Plastics Treaty can help make that future possible—if people everywhere stand together to demand it.
