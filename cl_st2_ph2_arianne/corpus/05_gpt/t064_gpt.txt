In a three-part animated series by Green Future, Greenpeace's climate education project, teenagers Sunny and Ho travel to the year 2100 and witness a world reshaped by climate change. Through their eyes, viewers see both what is at risk if we fail to act and what is possible if we choose a different path.

In the first episode, Sunny and Ho arrive at “The Last Tree” exhibition. Here, the natural world survives only in fragments: rare butterflies, flowers, and fruits are displayed like precious artifacts. The exhibition shows how much has been lost, turning what should be everyday wonders into museum pieces. As Sunny and Ho move through the exhibition, the beauty of these remaining species is shadowed by the knowledge that they are among the last of their kind.

The second episode takes the teenagers underwater to explore a flooded city. Once a bustling place on land, it now lies beneath the sea. Sunny and Ho follow sea otters through submerged streets and buildings, discovering how rising waters have erased familiar landscapes. The playful movements of the otters contrast with the quiet ruins of human life, highlighting how climate change reshapes both ecosystems and communities.

In the third episode, Sunny and Ho sit down at a restaurant and are confronted with a choice about what to eat. They reject meat, and in that moment imagine the vast land devastation caused by industrial farming. The vision of damaged soils and stripped landscapes makes clear how everyday decisions, like what we put on our plates, are connected to the health of the planet.

Alongside these stark futures, the series also shows a different vision of 2100: cities powered by solar and wind energy, and lives built around plant-based choices. In this hopeful future, clean energy and sustainable food systems help protect nature and people alike. By contrasting these paths, the series urges viewers to act now so that the world ahead is shaped by renewable power, thriving ecosystems, and choices that respect the planet and future generations.
