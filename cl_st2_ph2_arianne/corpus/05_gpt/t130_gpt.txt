Garment waste from major fashion brands, including Nike, Ralph Lauren, and Diesel, is being burnt in Cambodian brick kilns, exposing workers to toxic fumes from polyester. This practice, revealed by an Unearthed investigation, is another stark example of how the fashion industry’s linear “take-make-waste” model pushes its environmental and human costs onto communities in the Global South.

Instead of being safely reused, repaired, or recycled, clothing offcuts and unsold stock are treated as disposable. Burning polyester-based waste releases hazardous fumes, and the people most directly exposed are kiln workers, who often have little power to refuse dangerous conditions. This is not an isolated problem but part of a broader pattern in which the fashion system depends on cheap labour, weak regulation, and hidden supply chains to keep prices low and production volumes high.

Brands continue to market themselves as sustainable, using recycled collections or “eco” ranges to signal responsibility. Yet the discovery of their waste feeding toxic fires in Cambodian kilns exposes how shallow these sustainability claims can be. Greenwashing distracts from the core problem: an overproducing industry that treats clothes as short-lived commodities and communities in producer countries as expendable.

Greenpeace campaigns have previously exposed how clothing waste and pollution are offloaded onto countries in East Africa, showing how the Global North’s overconsumption drives waste dumping and environmental harm far from where most clothes are bought. The Cambodian kilns are another manifestation of the same system, in which the burden of fast fashion’s excess is shifted onto those least able to bear it.

The COVID-19 pandemic made this injustice even sharper. When brands cancelled orders and walked away from supply contracts, workers and suppliers were left with crushing losses. This economic shock has pushed many deeper into insecurity and debt, creating conditions where debt bondage and other forms of exploitation become more likely. In such a context, dangerous jobs like feeding garment waste into brick kilns can feel like the only option for survival.

The industry’s wastefulness is built into its production model. Tight deadlines, last-minute design changes, and relentless pressure to cut costs mean that up to half of all materials can be wasted before clothes even reach shops. These systemic inefficiencies, combined with overproduction, flood the world with garments that are quickly discarded, feeding a constant stream of waste into places like Cambodian kilns.

Transforming this system requires more than voluntary pledges. Brands must move away from overproduction and short-lived trends, and commit to designing and making fewer, longer-lasting garments. Circular practices—such as repair, reuse, and genuine recycling—need to be prioritised over incineration and dumping. That means planning for durability and recyclability from the outset, rather than treating waste as an afterthought.

Regulation is essential to drive this change. In Europe, there are growing calls for strong rules that force fashion companies to take responsibility for their entire supply chains and waste streams. EU legislation can play a crucial role by demanding transparency, banning exploitative practices, and ensuring that environmental and social costs are not simply exported to the Global South. Ending exploitation and toxic waste dumping will require binding rules that make it impossible for brands to hide the true impacts of their business model behind glossy sustainability campaigns.

The burning of garment waste in Cambodian brick kilns is a symptom of a deeper crisis in the fashion industry. Addressing it means confronting the overproduction, exploitation, and greenwashing at the heart of fast fashion—and replacing them with a system built on justice, transparency, and clothes made to last.
