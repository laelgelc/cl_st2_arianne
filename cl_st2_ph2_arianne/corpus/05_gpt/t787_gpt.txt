When I went to Davos, it wasn’t to be dazzled by the snow-capped peaks or the polished language of “stakeholder capitalism.” It was to speak directly to the people whose decisions are driving the climate crisis – and to appeal to their humanity.

In the halls and side rooms of the World Economic Forum, I carried with me the stories of communities already living through climate breakdown: people losing homes and harvests to floods, fires, storms and droughts. Extreme weather is now recognised as one of the top global risks, and it is inseparable from the climate crisis. That crisis is not an accident of nature; it is tightly bound to how powerful corporations operate, and to the systems that shield them from consequences.

This is why we launched the “Justice for People and Planet” report.

The report looks at 20 emblematic cases where corporations have exploited legal loopholes, tax treaties and weak or captured regulation to extract profit at the expense of human rights and the environment. These are not isolated incidents or a few “bad apples.” They are symptoms of a deeper problem: a global economic and legal architecture that too often rewards harm and allows those responsible to walk away.

The cases span sectors and continents, but they share common threads.

Volkswagen’s dieselgate scandal revealed how a major car manufacturer could deceive regulators and the public about emissions, undermining both climate action and public health. Logging giant Resolute and pipeline company Energy Transfer used SLAPP suits – strategic lawsuits against public participation – to try to silence critics and intimidate those who dared to speak out. Glencore’s activities left communities living with pollution, while the role of ACS in Guatemala’s Renace project showed how large infrastructure developments can proceed despite serious social and environmental impacts.

In each of these examples, people and ecosystems paid the price while companies used the law as a shield and sometimes as a weapon.

“Justice for People and Planet” doesn’t just document harm; it lays out a path forward. The report proposes Corporate Accountability Principles designed to close the gaps that allow abuse to flourish. At their core is a simple idea: corporations must be held liable when they violate human rights or damage the environment, and they must not be allowed to do abroad what is prohibited in their home countries.

If a practice is too dangerous, too dirty or too abusive to be legal where a company is headquartered, it should not be legal anywhere.

This is about more than rules on paper. It is about shifting power away from corporate impunity and towards communities, workers and the ecosystems on which all life depends. It is about ensuring that when extreme weather strikes – when rivers overflow, crops fail, or heatwaves turn deadly – we can trace responsibility through supply chains, boardrooms and financial flows, and demand real accountability.

In Davos, I met leaders who insisted they understood the urgency of the climate crisis. But understanding is not enough. As long as the same companies that publicly pledge “climate leadership” can privately exploit loopholes, capture regulators and intimidate critics, the crisis will deepen.

Appealing to their humanity means asking them to look beyond quarterly profits and see the people behind the statistics: the families displaced by flooding, the children breathing toxic air, the communities whose lands and waters are sacrificed. It means insisting that justice is not an optional add-on to climate policy; it is its foundation.

The climate crisis is already here. Extreme weather is already reshaping our world. The question now is whether we will allow the systems that created this crisis to continue unchanged – or whether we will demand rules that put people and planet before corporate power.

“Justice for People and Planet” is an invitation, and a challenge, to choose the latter.
