As the climate crisis accelerates, governments and corporations must act now to end our dangerous addiction to fossil fuels. The science is clear, the solutions exist, and the window for meaningful action is rapidly closing. Yet some of the world’s most powerful companies are still clinging to coal and other fossil fuels, even as they promote a green image.

One of those companies is Samsung.

As a major sponsor of the Winter Olympics in South Korea, Samsung has a unique opportunity to show real leadership on climate. With its global reach and influence, Samsung could help transform the entire tech industry by committing to power its operations with 100% renewable energy. Instead, the company’s current energy choices are undermining its public image and our shared future.

Samsung’s energy footprint is enormous – larger than that of a small country. Yet less than 1% of that energy comes from renewable sources. Behind the glossy marketing and public relations claims, Samsung still runs on coal and other fossil fuels. This is completely out of step with what science demands and what people around the world expect from global brands.

That is why Greenpeace, backed by thousands of supporters, is calling on Samsung’s leadership to #DoBiggerThings and make a firm commitment to 100% renewable energy. This is not just about one company’s brand; it is about the responsibility that comes with power, scale, and global influence.

People are taking action in cities around the world, including London and New York, to demand that Samsung stop relying on fossil fuels and start investing in a clean, renewable energy future. From creative protests to public mobilisations, this growing movement is sending a clear message: the era of coal-powered tech must end.

You can add your voice too. Join the call for change by participating in a virtual banner drop through social media. A simple tweet can help amplify the pressure on Samsung’s CEOs to switch to renewable energy and set a powerful example for the entire industry.

Fossil fuels are driving the climate crisis, and every year of delay locks in more damage. Governments must set bold policies to phase out coal, oil and gas, and corporations must match that ambition with real, measurable commitments. Samsung has the resources, the technology and the visibility to help lead this shift.

It is time for Samsung – and all major corporations – to move beyond empty promises and take concrete action. By committing to 100% renewable energy, Samsung can prove that doing bigger things means doing the right thing for people and the planet.
