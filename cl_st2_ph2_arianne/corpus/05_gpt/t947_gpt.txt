EU member states have voted to close a major loophole in chemical safety by banning the toxic chemical NPE from textile imports. Until now, NPE was banned in textile production within the EU, but clothing made with NPE elsewhere in the world could still be sold in European shops. This decision means that contaminated clothing will no longer be able to enter the EU market once the ban comes into force.

NPE, or nonylphenol ethoxylates, is commonly used in textile manufacturing. When released into the environment, it breaks down into nonylphenol, a substance known to disrupt hormones. Concerns about NPE’s impacts were highlighted in a 2011 report that drew attention to its widespread use in global textile supply chains and its hazardous properties.

This new ban is a direct response to those concerns and represents a significant step towards a toxic-free future. It sends a strong signal to global brands and producers that hazardous chemicals have no place in our clothes. Supporters of the ban have called on major fashion brands such as Gap, Nike, and Diesel to detoxify their supply chains and eliminate NPE and other dangerous substances from their production processes.

The decision will not take immediate effect; the ban is scheduled to come into force in five years. This transition period increases pressure on exporting countries, including major textile producers like China, to reform their practices and move away from NPE use in textile manufacturing.

For Greenpeace, this is an important victory within the broader Detox campaign, which is pushing for the elimination of all hazardous chemicals from textile production. While the NPE import ban is a key milestone, the campaign continues to demand comprehensive action from both governments and industry to ensure that clothing is safe for people and the environment at every stage of its life cycle.
