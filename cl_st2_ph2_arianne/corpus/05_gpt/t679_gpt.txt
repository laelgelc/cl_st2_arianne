An open letter has been sent to Chancellor Angela Merkel calling for an immediate halt to tree felling in Hambach Forest. The signatories urge that no further clearing should take place at least until Germany’s Coal Commission has presented its proposal for a coal phase-out that is compatible with the Paris Agreement. They also insist that the energy company RWE and the state government of North Rhine-Westphalia must fully respect such a moratorium.

The letter demands that the federal government legally anchor a coal phase-out by 2030 in the course of 2019. According to the signatories, this is essential if Germany is to still have a chance of meeting its 2020 climate targets. They connect the fate of Hambach Forest directly to the broader question of how quickly and fairly Germany can move away from coal.

The situation around Hambach Forest is described as increasingly tense. The letter points to escalating conflicts on the ground and emphasizes that many of the actions there are peaceful protests. The ongoing destruction of the forest, while coal remains a central part of Germany’s energy mix, is portrayed as damaging to the country’s international climate reputation.

The signatories highlight that investors are already pushing for change, noting existing support for an OECD-wide coal exit by 2030. They argue that this aligns with the need for a rapid phase-out in Germany and reinforces the case for a 2030 deadline to be written into law.

The letter also refers to recent extreme weather events as underlining the urgency of climate action. Against the backdrop of Germany’s failure so far to meet its emissions reduction goals, the authors argue that the country is nevertheless in a strong position to lead a socially just transition away from coal. They present Hambach Forest, the work of the Coal Commission, and a 2030 coal phase-out as key tests of whether Germany will seize that leadership role.
