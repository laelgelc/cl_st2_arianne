From the deck of the Rainbow Warrior, Victor Pickering looks out over the vast Pacific and sees a new threat rising from the depths. In the Clarion Clipperton Zone, thousands of metres below the surface, deep sea mining tests are underway. Companies like GSR are pushing ahead, even after losing equipment on the seafloor, and are still aiming to exploit these little-known ocean depths.

Scientists have warned that mining the deep sea could cause irreversible damage to fragile ecosystems that have taken millennia to form. Yet the tests continue in an area that remains largely unexplored, risking harm to species and habitats we barely understand. For Victor, a Fijian activist, this is not an abstract concern. It is another layer added to an ocean already in crisis.

Across the Pacific, communities are living with sea level rise that threatens homes, ancestral lands and burial grounds. Fish stocks that once sustained families and cultures are depleted. Plastic pollution washes up on shores and tangles in reefs, a constant reminder of a throwaway economy that treats the ocean as a dumping ground.

For Pacific peoples, the ocean is not just a resource. It is identity, culture and lifeline. It feeds communities, shapes traditions, and connects islands across vast distances. When the ocean is under attack, so are the people who depend on it for survival, dignity and future generations.

That is why resistance to deep sea mining is growing across the region. Islands like Fiji and Vanuatu are standing up to say no, calling for a ban on this new industry before it begins. Their message is clear: the ocean is already under immense pressure, and adding deep sea mining to the list of threats is a risk too great to take.

Victor’s call from the Rainbow Warrior is a call for global solidarity. He urges the world to stand with Pacific communities and to choose protection over exploitation. Central to this is the push for a strong Global Ocean Treaty that can help safeguard 30% of the world’s oceans by 2030. Such protection would be a vital step towards giving marine life space to recover and ensuring that the ocean can continue to support people and planet.

Greenpeace stands with Victor and Pacific communities in demanding a worldwide ban on deep sea mining. The choice is between repeating the mistakes that have driven the climate and biodiversity crises, or charting a different course—one that respects the ocean as the source of life it is, and defends it for the millennia to come.
