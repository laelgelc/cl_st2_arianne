Across the world, women are leading powerful movements to protect the planet, drawing on their cultures, communities, and unique talents to confront the climate and biodiversity crises.

On the lands of the Secwepemc First Nation in what is now Canada, Kanahus Manuel stands on the frontlines of resistance to the Trans Mountain pipeline. Her work continues an intergenerational struggle for Indigenous rights, defending her people’s territories, waters, and ways of life. By challenging destructive fossil fuel expansion, she is also challenging systems of colonialism that have long ignored Indigenous sovereignty. Her leadership shows how land defense is inseparable from the fight for justice and self-determination.

Far to the south, in the frozen landscapes of Antarctica, Sandra Guzmán is advancing climate research while opening doors for more women in science. Her work examines the impacts of the climate crisis in one of the most fragile regions on Earth, where changes in ice and ecosystems have global consequences. At the same time, she is dedicated to empowering women scientists, helping to ensure that those shaping climate knowledge and policy are as diverse as the communities most affected by environmental breakdown.

In the Sahel region of Chad, Hindou Oumarou Ibrahim is building bridges between traditional knowledge and modern science to help communities adapt to a rapidly changing climate. Through her organization AFPAT, she works with Indigenous peoples to create 3D maps of their territories. These maps bring together local knowledge of water sources, grazing lands, and sacred sites with scientific data, guiding decisions that protect both people and ecosystems. Her approach shows how listening to Indigenous communities can lead to more effective, just, and sustainable climate solutions.

In Indonesia, the rainforest becomes both studio and subject for DJ Ninda Felina. She ventures into the forest to record the sounds of birds, insects, and rustling leaves, weaving these natural soundscapes into her music. Through the Save Our Sounds project, she uses these recordings to educate and inspire her audiences about the importance of protecting rainforests. By turning the living voice of the forest into a powerful artistic tool, she helps people connect emotionally to places they may never visit but whose survival is vital to us all.

Each of these women brings her own skills, experiences, and creativity to the environmental movement. From legal and cultural resistance to fossil fuel projects, to polar research, to mapping for climate resilience, to music that carries the message of the forest, they are empowering their communities and reminding the world that another future is possible. Their work fosters hope—not as a passive feeling, but as an active force driving collective action for a more just and livable planet.
