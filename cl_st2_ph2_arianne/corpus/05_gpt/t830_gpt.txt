The Copenhagen Fashion Summit brings together some of the world’s biggest clothing brands, including H&M, Zara, and Burberry, to talk about sustainability at a time when the fashion industry is under intense scrutiny. With annual revenues of around €1.5 trillion and more than a billion garments produced every year, the sector is on a trajectory of continued expansion, with production projected to grow by 63% by 2030.

This growth comes with a heavy environmental price. The industry uses around 80 billion cubic meters of water, generates over a million tonnes of CO2 emissions, and produces 92 million tonnes of waste annually. These impacts are driving fashion higher on the agenda at events like the Copenhagen Fashion Summit, where the concept of circularity has moved to the center of the conversation.

Circularity aims to keep materials in use for as long as possible through strategies like reuse, repair, and recycling. At the summit, it is presented as a key pathway to making fashion more sustainable. However, circularity alone cannot solve the problem if overall production continues to rise. On a finite planet, unlimited growth in clothing output is not compatible with environmental limits, no matter how efficient or circular individual garments become.

Focusing on circularity without addressing volumes risks becoming a distraction. If brands continue to produce ever more clothing, then recycling schemes and take-back programs can act as a kind of placebo: they may make both companies and consumers feel better, but they do not fundamentally reduce the sector’s total footprint. Relying on consumers to recycle or to participate in brand-led sustainability initiatives cannot substitute for systemic change in how much is produced in the first place.

A real shift requires moving away from the fast fashion model that depends on rapid turnover of cheap, short-lived garments. Instead, brands need to prioritize designing and selling clothes that are durable and repairable, and to support practices that keep items in use for longer. This means not just talking about sustainability, but actively encouraging people to buy fewer, better-made pieces rather than constantly refreshing their wardrobes.

The discussions at the Copenhagen Fashion Summit highlight that the fashion industry stands at a crossroads. Circularity can be part of the solution, but only if it goes hand in hand with a clear commitment to reducing overall production volumes. Without that, sustainability claims risk masking a business-as-usual approach on a planet that cannot support endless growth.
