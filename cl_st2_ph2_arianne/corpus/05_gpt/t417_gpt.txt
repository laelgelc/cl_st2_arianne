When the world went into lockdown, a popular idea spread online: with humans indoors, “nature is healing.” Clearer skies, wildlife in city streets, a temporary dip in emissions – all of it seemed to suggest that if people simply stepped back, ecosystems would quickly bounce back.

But this comforting story hides a harder truth.

Greenpeace, together with Brazilian actress Alice Braga, has launched the animated series “Countdown to Destruction” to spotlight what really drives environmental breakdown: an industrial food system built on meat, dairy, soy, and palm oil that devours forests, displaces Indigenous Peoples, and fuels the climate crisis.

The series focuses on the Amazon, a forest that connects us all through the global food chains that stock supermarket shelves around the world. Behind everyday products are vast monocultures of soy, cattle ranches, and plantations that push the forest frontier deeper every year. This isn’t about isolated bad actors or individual “bad choices”; it’s about an economic model that treats endless growth as non‑negotiable, even when it collides with the limits of living ecosystems.

In this model, forests are cleared for feed and pasture, rivers are polluted, and Indigenous communities are pushed from their territories. The Amazon becomes a sacrifice zone so that a handful of companies can keep expanding production and profits. The true cost is paid in lost biodiversity, destabilised climate, and the erosion of cultures and ways of life that have protected these lands for generations.

“Countdown to Destruction” challenges the illusion that minor lifestyle tweaks or temporary slowdowns are enough to fix this. Individual choices matter, but they exist inside systems designed to reward destruction. The brands that profit from deforestation-linked commodities, and the governments that enable them, hold the power – and the responsibility – to change course.

Turning this crisis into an opportunity means demanding that power be used differently. It means centring Indigenous voices and leadership, not as a symbol, but as a condition for any real solution. Indigenous Peoples have defended the Amazon and other forests despite facing violence, criminalisation, and dispossession. Their rights, knowledge, and governance are essential to any path out of climate chaos.

Protecting the Amazon is not just about saving trees or rare species. It is about confronting an unjust economic model and replacing it with one rooted in equality, justice, and respect for planetary boundaries. A safe climate and a fair society rise or fall together – and the Amazon sits at the heart of both.

By amplifying the stories told in “Countdown to Destruction” and the voices of those on the frontlines, we can help shift the narrative: away from passive hope that “nature will heal” on its own, and toward active, collective pressure on brands and governments to transform the food system and protect the forest. The choice is stark, and the countdown is real – but so is the chance to build something better.
