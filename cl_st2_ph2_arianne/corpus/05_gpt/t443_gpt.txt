The COVID-19 pandemic exposed just how fragile and unequal our cities can be—but it also opened a window to imagine something radically better. As streets fell quiet and skies cleared, we got a glimpse of what cities could look like if they were redesigned around people and the planet instead of traffic and pollution. Now, as we confront both the climate crisis and ongoing public health threats, we have a chance—and a responsibility—to reshape urban life for sustainability, resilience and justice.

One of the clearest lessons from the pandemic is that cities work best when they prioritize people over cars. Around the world, emergency bike lanes appeared almost overnight, pavements were widened, and some roads were closed to traffic so people could walk and cycle safely. These changes showed that expanding bike lanes and investing in reliable, affordable public transport can quickly transform how we move. In many places, the next step should be to go further: restricting or even banning private cars from certain areas and redesigning whole neighborhoods so that green, safe, low-traffic streets become the norm, not the exception. Car-free and low-traffic zones can cut air pollution, reduce climate-wrecking emissions, and create quieter, safer streets where children can play and communities can thrive.

The pandemic also revealed how vulnerable our food systems are. Long supply chains, concentrated industrial agriculture and global shocks combined to create empty shelves for some, while others were forced to keep working in unsafe conditions to keep food moving. Industrial agriculture is a major driver of greenhouse gas emissions, as well as deforestation and biodiversity loss. Rethinking how we produce and access food is essential if cities are to become more resilient and climate-safe.

Local urban farming can play a key role here—whether it’s rooftop gardens, community plots, or small-scale food production integrated into neighborhoods. When cities support local growers and short supply chains, they reduce dependence on distant, polluting industrial farms and cut the emissions tied to transport and storage. At the same time, shifting our diets towards more plant-based options and focusing on seasonal eating can significantly lower the climate impact of what ends up on our plates. Plant-based meals generally require fewer resources and create fewer emissions than meat-heavy diets, while seasonal food often travels shorter distances and relies less on energy-intensive production methods. Together, these changes can help build food systems that are both fairer and more robust in the face of crises.

Overconsumption is another root cause of climate breakdown that the pandemic brought into sharp focus. Our current economic model encourages buying more, using things briefly, and throwing them away—driving emissions, pollution and waste. To build sustainable cities, we need to move away from this throwaway culture and embrace reuse, repair and sharing as everyday practices.

That means making it easier to fix what we already own, from electronics to clothing and furniture, and supporting local repair services and skills. It means encouraging reuse through refill stations, secondhand markets and systems that keep products and materials in use for as long as possible. And it means expanding sharing—from tool libraries and shared workspaces to community car- and bike-sharing schemes—so that people can access what they need without everyone having to own everything. These approaches can cut emissions, reduce waste and help make urban life more affordable and equitable.

Access to nature and green spaces is not a luxury; it’s a basic need. During lockdowns, many people discovered just how vital parks, trees and open spaces are for mental and physical wellbeing. Yet in too many cities, access to green space depends on your postcode and income. Redesigning cities for resilience must include creating more accessible, high-quality green spaces for everyone, especially in neighborhoods that have been historically neglected.

Empty lots, unused corners of public land and abandoned spaces can be transformed into community gardens, pocket parks and shared green areas. Community gardens in particular bring multiple benefits: they provide fresh food, strengthen social ties, offer educational opportunities and give people a direct connection to nature in the heart of the city. Greening streets with trees and plants can cool urban heat islands, improve air quality and make walking and cycling more attractive. When residents are involved in planning and caring for these spaces, they become powerful hubs of community resilience.

None of this will happen on its own. Building healthier, more equitable and climate-safe cities requires citizen-led action. The pandemic showed how quickly communities can organize to support each other—from mutual aid networks to neighborhood initiatives that cared for the most vulnerable. That same energy and solidarity can drive long-term change in how our cities are designed and governed.

Residents can push for protected bike lanes and better public transport, demand that empty spaces be turned into gardens or parks, support local urban farmers and plant-based food initiatives, and champion policies that make repair, reuse and sharing the default. Community groups can bring people together to imagine and co-create new visions for their neighborhoods, ensuring that the voices of those most affected by pollution, overcrowding and lack of green space are at the center of decision-making.

The crises of climate breakdown and global pandemics are deeply intertwined, and they both expose the same underlying injustices and vulnerabilities in our urban systems. But they also point us towards the same solutions: cities designed for people and the planet, not for endless traffic and consumption. By rethinking transport, food, consumption and public space—guided by community leadership and a commitment to equity—we can turn this moment of disruption into a turning point.

The choice now is whether we try to return to a “normal” that was already failing people and the climate, or whether we seize this chance to build cities that are greener, fairer and more resilient. The path to safer, more sustainable urban life is already visible in the bike lanes painted overnight, the neighborhood gardens that sprang up in vacant lots, and the mutual aid networks that showed what solidarity can achieve. It’s up to all of us to make those glimpses of a better future permanent.
