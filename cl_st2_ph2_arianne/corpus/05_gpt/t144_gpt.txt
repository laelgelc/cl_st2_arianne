At dawn on the Manicoré River, the forest wakes before the sun. A chorus of birds, the hum of insects, the splash of fish breaking the surface – all of it reminds us that the Amazon is still very much alive, even as it faces some of the gravest threats in its history.

From Manaus, Greenpeace Brazil has embarked on a month-long expedition into this region, traveling along the Manicoré River to deepen our understanding of Amazonian biodiversity and to support local communities who are fighting every day to protect their lands. This journey is not only scientific; it is political, emotional, and profoundly human.

The communities along the Manicoré are on the frontline of the struggle for the forest. Their territories are under pressure from destructive activities and government neglect, and they face violence and intimidation for defending their homes. By joining them on this expedition, Greenpeace Brazil is helping to strengthen their calls for protection and recognition, amplifying voices that are too often silenced or ignored.

This mission unfolds in the shadow of tragedy. The disappearance and confirmed deaths of Indigenous expert Bruno Araújo Pereira and journalist Dom Phillips are a stark reminder of the dangers faced by those who defend the Amazon and report on its reality. Their loss has shaken Brazil and the world, but it has not stopped the work. On the contrary, the expedition continues in their honor – a testament to the courage and persistence of those who refuse to give up on a living, just Amazon.

In the midst of grief and tension, the forest still offers signs of resilience. Ornithologists accompanying the expedition documented “Chico’s tyrannulet,” a bird named after forest defender and activist Chico Mendes, in a new northern habitat. This observation is more than a scientific note; it is a symbol of continuity between generations of struggle and care for the forest. From Chico Mendes to Bruno and Dom, and to the communities and researchers on the river today, there is a common thread: the belief that the Amazon can and must be protected.

The expedition’s purpose goes beyond data collection. It carries a clear message: a sustainable Amazon that respects the rights of its peoples is not only possible, it is essential. This vision stands in direct opposition to a reality marked by government neglect, environmental destruction, and violence against those who defend the land.

To make that vision real, justice is non-negotiable. Justice for Bruno and Dom. Justice for communities that live under threat. Justice for the forest itself, whose destruction fuels the climate crisis and erodes the foundations of life for millions of people.

The call from the Manicoré is one of resistance and solidarity. It asks the public to stand with those who protect the forest and to demand that authorities guarantee safety, enforce protections, and respect rights. It asks us to recognize that defending the Amazon is inseparable from defending human rights, freedom of expression, and the possibility of a livable future.

As the expedition boat moves along the dark waters of the river, every documented species, every conversation with a riverside family, every act of support for local struggles becomes part of a broader movement. It is a movement that insists the Amazon is not a frontier to be exploited, but a living home to be safeguarded – for the people who inhabit it today and for all generations to come.

In the memory of those who have fallen and in solidarity with those who continue, the journey on the Manicoré River is a powerful reminder: protecting the forest and its peoples is an act of courage, of love, and of necessary resistance. Public support is vital to ensure that this courage is not met with silence, but with action strong enough to keep the Amazon standing.
