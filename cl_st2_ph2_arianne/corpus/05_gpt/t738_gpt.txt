When we first set out to document the Amazon Reef, we knew we were heading into one of the most challenging and least-understood regions of the Atlantic. Returning there with the Greenpeace ship Esperanza, we confronted exactly what makes this place so hard to study: rough seas, powerful currents and deep, murky waters at the mouth of the Amazon River. Yet even in these conditions, what we found confirms that this reef system is far more extensive—and far more threatened—than previously acknowledged.

Early scientific estimates suggested the Amazon Reef covered around 9,500 square kilometers. Now, recent studies indicate it may span up to 56,000 square kilometers, stretching through deep waters where the Amazon’s sediment-rich outflow meets the Atlantic Ocean. This is a vast, hidden ecosystem, thriving in conditions once thought too harsh and too dark for such formations to exist.

On board the Esperanza, we focused on areas overlapping with oil giant Total’s planned drilling blocks. Using our time at sea to search for signs of reef structures, we documented reef formations inside the very blocks where Total had claimed no such ecosystems existed. These findings directly contradict the company’s assertions and underscore how little is still known—and how much is at stake—when oil companies push into frontier regions.

The impact of this evidence has gone beyond the scientific community. A federal prosecutor in Brazil has recommended that Total’s license to drill in the area be denied, citing the presence of reef formations in the company’s blocks. This recommendation reflects a growing recognition that drilling in such a sensitive and poorly understood environment carries unacceptable risks.

Our work did not stop at Brazil’s maritime borders. Expeditions in French Guiana revealed that the reef system there is connected to the Amazon Reef off Brazil. This continuity shows that we are not dealing with isolated patches of life, but with a transboundary reef complex. Any oil spill in one part of this system could spread across borders, threatening marine life and coastal communities in neighboring countries.

This is why opposition to drilling in the region has grown so rapidly. More than 2 million people around the world have already spoken out against oil exploration in the Amazon Reef area. Their message is clear: this unique ecosystem must be protected from the risks of offshore drilling.

You can add your voice to this global movement. By signing the petition to protect the Amazon Reef from oil exploration, you help increase the pressure on decision-makers to put this extraordinary ecosystem off-limits to drilling and to prioritize its protection for the future.
