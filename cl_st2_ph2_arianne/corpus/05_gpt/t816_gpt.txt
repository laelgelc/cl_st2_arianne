In cities and towns across the country, Greenpeace activists took to the streets with a simple invitation: stand for the Great Northern Forest. One by one, people stopped, listened, and chose to be photographed holding their support for protecting one of the world’s most important forest landscapes.

The goal was clear. These portraits would not stay in the streets. They were destined for the forest itself—specifically, a threatened site in Sweden facing imminent logging, right next to a barren clearcut that shows what is at stake when old forests are destroyed.

Nearly 300 people took part, representing many different backgrounds and walks of life. Together, their portraits formed a powerful, human wall of support for the Great Northern Forest, a landscape critical for unique species and for stabilizing the global climate. Each face, each image, carried the same message: these forests are too important to lose.

Greenpeace brought these portraits to the forest and placed them in the shadow of the looming logging plans, right beside the clearcut. The contrast was stark: on one side, a stripped and empty landscape; on the other, hundreds of people insisting on a different future.

Participants shared why they chose to stand for the forest. Some spoke about saving old forests for their wisdom, seeing them as living archives of time and resilience. Others talked about roots—both literal and symbolic—reminding us that these ecosystems anchor life, culture, and climate. Many focused on the future, calling for a world rich in biodiversity and climate stability, where ancient forests are still standing for generations to come.

All of these voices are part of a growing movement calling for strong protection of the Great Northern Forest and for an end to its destruction. Central to this is a demand directed at Essity: stop destroying the forest. Activists and supporters are urging people everywhere to help build pressure on the company, so that the landscapes that shelter unique species and help stabilize our climate are preserved, not turned into clearcuts.

The portraits in the forest are more than images. They are a reminder that the fate of the Great Northern Forest is not only a local issue, but a global one—and that thousands of individual choices to stand up, speak out, and demand change can add up to a powerful force for protection.
