Civil disobedience has always been a powerful way to confront systems that refuse to change, and today one of the most dangerous systems we face is the financial machinery driving the climate crisis. As long as money continues to flow into coal, oil and gas, governments and corporations will keep expanding fossil fuel extraction, locking us into a future of escalating climate chaos.

In Sweden, a clear example of this conflict is the state pension fund, which continues to invest in fossil fuel companies. These are the same companies whose business models are fundamentally incompatible with keeping global heating within the limits set by the Paris Agreement. When our retirement savings are used to fuel climate breakdown, the system is not only morally bankrupt – it is economically reckless.

Greenpeace Sweden has decided to confront this directly through civil disobedience. As an employer, Greenpeace Sweden is required to pay pension contributions to the state pension fund. But a portion of those contributions is still being invested in fossil fuels. Instead of quietly accepting this, Greenpeace Sweden is refusing to pay that fossil fuel–financing portion into the state system. The money is being placed in a safe account, where it will remain until Swedish pension policies are brought in line with the Paris Agreement.

This is a deliberate, transparent act of resistance. It challenges the idea that citizens and organisations must passively accept that their money is used to undermine their own future. It also sends a clear signal to decision-makers: public funds must not be used to prop up an industry that is driving the planet towards climate catastrophe.

There is another reason this resistance is necessary: the growing risk of stranded fossil fuel assets. As the world shifts – however slowly – towards renewable energy and tighter climate regulation, investments in coal, oil and gas are becoming increasingly risky. Fossil fuel reserves that cannot be burned in a Paris-aligned world will lose their value, leaving investors and pension funds exposed. This raises the threat of a financial shock on the scale of the 2008 economic meltdown, triggered not by subprime mortgages but by overvalued fossil fuel assets.

To avoid that scenario, the world must rapidly redirect capital away from fossil fuels and towards climate solutions. This is already happening, but far too slowly. Global divestment efforts – where institutions and individuals move their money out of fossil fuel companies – need to be dramatically scaled up. Universities, municipalities, pension funds, banks, insurers and cultural institutions all have a responsibility to ensure their investments are not driving climate breakdown.

Individuals can act too: by asking their banks and pension providers where their money goes, by switching to fossil-free options where possible, and by supporting campaigns that demand large-scale divestment. Every euro, krona or dollar moved out of fossil fuels and into renewables, efficiency, and sustainable infrastructure helps weaken the political power of the fossil fuel industry and strengthen the transition we urgently need.

The scale of that transition is enormous. A UN report has estimated that around $90 trillion must be invested in renewable and sustainable solutions to meet global climate goals. This is not a distant, abstract number – it is a measure of how radically our economies must be reshaped. Public and private finance must be redirected on a historic scale, away from the industries that are destabilising our climate and towards those that can secure a livable future.

Civil disobedience against financial systems that refuse to change is one way to accelerate that shift. By refusing to let public money be used to finance fossil fuels, Greenpeace Sweden is showing that obedience to unjust, climate-wrecking rules is not an option. It is a call to question where our money sleeps at night – and to withdraw our consent when it funds destruction.

If you believe that our financial systems should serve people and planet, not fossil fuel profits, you can add your voice. Support the push to end public financing of fossil fuels and scale up investment in renewable solutions. Sign the petition and help build the pressure needed to bring our pension systems, and the wider financial world, in line with the Paris Agreement.
