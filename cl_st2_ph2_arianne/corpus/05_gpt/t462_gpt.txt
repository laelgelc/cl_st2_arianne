The COVID-19 crisis has exposed how deeply human health is connected to the health of the planet. Far from being an isolated event, the pandemic is part of a broader pattern in which environmental destruction, climate change, and the way we use land are reshaping the risks of infectious disease.

One key concept in understanding this connection is the “dilution effect.” In ecosystems with high biodiversity, disease spread can be reduced because pathogens are more likely to encounter hosts that do not effectively transmit them. In other words, a rich variety of species can act as a buffer. When biodiversity is lost, that natural buffering capacity weakens, and the chances of diseases spilling over into human populations can increase.

Deforestation, mining, and rapid urbanization are pushing people deeper into previously intact ecosystems, increasing contact between humans, wildlife, and the viruses they carry. Expert Kate Jones has highlighted how these activities bring us into closer proximity with animals that can host dangerous pathogens. As forests are cleared and landscapes are fragmented, the boundaries that once separated human communities from wildlife are eroded, creating more opportunities for viruses to jump species.

Climate change is further amplifying these risks. Rising temperatures and more extreme weather events are changing where and how infectious diseases spread. Pathogens that rely on specific hosts, such as mosquitoes, are finding new areas where they can survive and thrive. As climate conditions shift, so do the ranges of these disease-carrying species, potentially exposing new populations to illnesses they have not encountered before.

Zoonotic diseases—those that pass from animals to humans—already make up about 75% of emerging infectious diseases. Their rise is closely linked to habitat loss and environmental degradation. As natural habitats are destroyed or altered, wildlife is forced into closer contact with people and domestic animals, increasing the likelihood that new diseases will emerge and spread.

The COVID-19 pandemic is unfolding alongside a global push for green transitions in energy, transport, and industry. Yet the economic fallout from the crisis threatens to slow or reverse this progress. There is a real risk that short-term recovery measures could lock societies into more pollution, more extraction, and more destruction of nature, rather than accelerating the move toward sustainability.

In this context, the choices governments make now are critical. The post-pandemic world cannot simply replicate the systems that helped create these risks in the first place. The moment calls for radical action: policies that protect and restore biodiversity, reduce habitat destruction, and tackle climate change at the speed and scale required. By aligning economic recovery with environmental protection, governments can reduce the likelihood of future pandemics while building more resilient, sustainable societies.
