Self-isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic has brought unexpected challenges for many people, making it harder to look after both physical and mental health while staying true to our guiding values. The sudden changes to daily routines, the distance from friends and family, and the uncertainty about the future have all added pressure at a time when we most need connection, care, and resilience.

In the midst of this, it is vital to remember those who cannot stay home. Nurses, doctors, delivery drivers, and many other essential workers continue to show extraordinary bravery, putting themselves at risk to care for others and keep societies functioning. Their work underpins our ability to stay safe, and their courage deserves deep gratitude and respect.

For those spending long periods at home, films and series can offer both comfort and inspiration. Stories about our planet and the people defending it can help us stay grounded in what matters and remind us of the bigger picture beyond our own four walls. A number of environmental films and series provide powerful perspectives on the climate and ecological crises, as well as on the movements working for change.

One recommendation follows Leonardo DiCaprio on a journey to witness the impacts of climate change around the world. Through his travels, viewers are confronted with the stark realities of a warming planet and the urgency of climate action.

Another film explores the founding of Greenpeace itself, tracing how a small group of committed people came together to challenge environmental destruction and spark a global movement. It offers a look at the roots of environmental activism and the power of collective action.

The ocean is at the heart of another recommendation, which highlights the oceanographic achievements of Sylvia Earle. Her life’s work reveals both the beauty and fragility of marine ecosystems, and underscores why protecting the seas is essential for all life on Earth.

A documentary on minimalism examines how living with less can open space for what truly matters, questioning consumer culture and its environmental footprint. At a moment when many are rethinking their priorities during isolation, this perspective can feel especially relevant.

Stories from Brazil show how communities are already living with the consequences of climate crises. These accounts bring home the human reality of environmental breakdown, far beyond statistics and headlines.

Another film challenges common myths about meat consumption and features Arnold Schwarzenegger among others. By questioning assumptions about diet, health, and strength, it invites viewers to reconsider the role of meat in their lives and its impact on the planet.

The film “Sexy Killer” exposes scandals in Indonesia’s coal industry, shedding light on how fossil fuel extraction can fuel corruption, pollution, and injustice. It reveals the hidden costs of coal that are often kept out of public view.

A documentary on coral bleaching in Australia focuses on the devastation facing coral reefs as oceans warm. The loss of these vibrant ecosystems is a stark warning about the consequences of inaction on climate change.

In a time of isolation, these films and series can help keep us connected to the wider world, to the struggles and victories of environmental defenders, and to the living planet we all share. They can also spark conversations, even at a distance, about the kind of future we want to build when this crisis passes.

Readers are invited to share their own favorite environmental films and documentaries—stories that have moved them, changed how they see the world, or inspired them to take action. By exchanging recommendations, we can support each other, stay informed, and keep our shared commitment to the planet alive, even while we are apart.
