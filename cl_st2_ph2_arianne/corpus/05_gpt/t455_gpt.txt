The 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster did not end when the explosions were extinguished and the initial cleanup was declared over. Decades later, long-lived radionuclides from the catastrophe are still present in the environment, continuing to circulate through forests, soils, and food chains. This persistent contamination means that Chernobyl remains a living nuclear crisis rather than a closed chapter in history.

On April 3, 2020, this ongoing danger took on a new and alarming form. Wildfires broke out in the Chernobyl exclusion zone and grew into the largest fires ever recorded there, burning 57,000 hectares—about 22% of the entire zone. These fires did more than destroy forests and landscapes. As they raged through contaminated areas, they released radioactive particles that had been locked in vegetation and soil since 1986.

Among the radionuclides driven back into the atmosphere were caesium-137, strontium-90, americium-241, and various plutonium isotopes. These substances are known for their long half-lives and their ability to enter the human body through inhalation and ingestion. Once inside, they can irradiate tissues from within, increasing the risk of serious health impacts, including cancer.

The smoke from these fires did not remain confined to the exclusion zone. It reached Kyiv, a major city downwind of the affected area, and travelled as far as Norway. Along its path, radiation levels increased, underscoring how nuclear contamination can be remobilised and transported across borders by something as common as wildfire smoke. This transboundary spread of radioactive particles is a stark reminder that nuclear accidents have consequences that extend far beyond their original sites and timelines.

For people living in the already contaminated regions of Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia, the fires added yet another layer of risk. Millions of people in these areas are still dealing with the long-term consequences of the Chernobyl disaster. The re-release of radioactive materials through wildfires compounds existing exposures and uncertainties, further threatening health and livelihoods.

These events also highlight how climate- and weather-related disasters can interact with nuclear legacies to create new emergencies. Wildfires in contaminated zones do not just threaten ecosystems; they turn forests and peatlands into vectors for radioactive pollution. This intensifies nuclear risks and places additional burdens on emergency services that must respond under extremely challenging conditions.

The timing of the April 2020 fires made the situation even more difficult. As the world grappled with the COVID-19 pandemic, emergency services were already stretched thin. Responders had to contend simultaneously with a public health crisis and a radiological hazard, illustrating how overlapping emergencies can strain the capacity to protect people and the environment.

The fires also exposed ongoing problems with transparency around nuclear risks. Inadequate, delayed, or unclear information undermines public trust and hampers effective protection measures. Communities need timely, accurate data on radiation levels, fire spread, and potential health impacts in order to make informed decisions. The 2020 wildfires in the Chernobyl exclusion zone demonstrate that, even decades after a nuclear disaster, transparency and accountability remain critical and contested issues.

The legacy of Chernobyl continues to shape lives and landscapes in Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia. The 2020 wildfires show that as long as long-lived radionuclides remain in the environment, events like forest fires can reawaken and redistribute the contamination. This reality underscores the enduring nature of nuclear disasters and the need for ongoing vigilance, robust emergency preparedness, and honest communication with affected populations.
