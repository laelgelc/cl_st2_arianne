I grew up in a South African township where religion was everywhere: in the streets, in our homes, in the way we greeted each other, and in the way we understood the world. Churches, mosques and other places of worship were full every week, and faith shaped our sense of identity and belonging. Yet for all this religious vibrancy, our community was also deeply insular. We had our own ways, our own truths, and our own boundaries about who belonged and who did not.

This cultural and religious insularity often sat uneasily alongside the promise of South Africa’s Constitution, which commits us to diversity, dignity and equality. On paper, our country celebrates a broad spectrum of identities and beliefs. In practice, many of us were raised within rigid ideas about gender, sexuality and morality. These ideas were rarely questioned, and when they were, it came at a cost for those who dared to live differently.

In recent years, the consequences of this intolerance have become more visible and more violent. Hate crimes against members of the LGBTQIA+ community have risen, pushing the issue into the national spotlight and prompting the President to speak out. That kind of intervention is important, but it also exposes a deeper problem: how easily religious language and authority can be used to justify discrimination and fuel hatred.

At the same time, climate change is tightening its grip on our lives. We see it in water scarcity that shapes our daily routines, in the way people are forced to move in search of work and safety, and in the slow erosion of productivity that undermines livelihoods. Food insecurity and hunger are no longer distant threats; they are realities that already affect 40% of South Africans.

Across the country, communities are living through droughts, floods and swarms of locusts. These “signs of the times” are not random. They are consistent with what the IPCC has been warning about: a warming world driving more extreme weather and destabilizing the systems we depend on. Yet in many of the religious spaces I know, these events are explained not as consequences of human choices—especially the choices of powerful corporations—but as evidence that we are living in the “end times.”

This narrative has serious consequences. Instead of asking how extractive industries, corporate greed and systemic inequality fuel climate breakdown, people are encouraged to look for scapegoats. Marginalized communities, including LGBTQIA+ people, are blamed for provoking divine anger, turning complex socio‑ecological crises into moral panics. Religion becomes a tool of manipulation, redirecting justified anger away from those who profit from destruction and towards those who are already vulnerable.

When drought hits, when food prices rise, when jobs disappear, it is easier to point fingers at people who do not conform than to confront the structures that keep power and profit concentrated in a few hands. This deflection protects the status quo. It keeps communities divided, fearful and suspicious of one another, rather than united in demanding accountability and change.

Breaking this cycle requires work at the grassroots level. Sensitization within communities is essential: opening honest conversations about climate change, about sexuality and gender, and about how our beliefs are used. It means challenging interpretations of religion that justify violence or exclusion, and creating space for faith traditions to support justice, compassion and solidarity instead.

An equitable future in South Africa will depend on our ability to refuse the false choice between faith and human rights, between spiritual conviction and scientific evidence. It will mean insisting that our responses to climate change do not sacrifice the dignity and safety of those already facing discrimination. And it will require us to confront the economic systems that place profit above people and the planet.

In the township where I grew up, the same energy that fills churches and mosques with song can also power movements for justice. If we can turn away from narratives that blame the marginalized for our shared crises, and instead recognize how corporate greed and extractive economies drive both social and ecological harm, we can begin to build something different.

That “something different” looks like communities informed about climate science, aware of how IPCC findings relate to their lived reality, and unwilling to accept hunger and hate as inevitable. It looks like religious leaders who refuse to weaponize scripture against LGBTQIA+ people, and who speak clearly about the need to protect land, water and livelihoods. It looks like policies that prioritize human well‑being over short‑term profit, and grassroots organizing that holds leaders to those commitments.

The struggles over identity, belonging and belief that shaped my upbringing are not separate from the climate crisis—they are intertwined with it. As climate impacts deepen, the temptation to retreat into fear and blame will grow. Our task is to resist that pull, to stand with those most at risk, and to insist that the future we are building is one where everyone can live with safety, dignity and enough to eat.
