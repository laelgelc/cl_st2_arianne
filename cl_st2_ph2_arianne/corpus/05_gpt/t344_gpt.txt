Around the world, communities are winning important environmental victories: forests are being protected, rivers cleaned up, and destructive projects halted. Yet, at the global level, the living systems we depend on continue to unravel. Climate change accelerates, biodiversity declines, and resource use keeps climbing. Local success and global failure are happening at the same time.

This contradiction is not simply a matter of missing technologies or insufficient policies. It is rooted in social inertia—the enormous momentum of our societies that resists deep change. Economies, institutions, and daily habits are all wired into patterns that reward extraction, consumption, and growth. Even when people and governments recognize the crisis, they are pulled back toward business as usual by the structures they live within.

Research by Garrett and colleagues underlines how deeply embedded this problem is. Their work shows that carbon emissions and energy demand are inseparably tied to the sum total of past and present economic growth. In other words, the more our economies have grown over time, the more energy they demand today, and the more carbon they emit. This makes it extremely difficult to “decouple” economic growth from fossil fuel use and emissions in any meaningful way. The system we have built carries its own momentum forward, regardless of our intentions.

History offers many examples of societies that delayed necessary change because powerful interests, institutions, and cultural norms held the line against transformation. Time and again, governments and corporations have promised that new technologies would solve environmental and social problems without requiring changes to underlying systems of production and consumption. The pattern repeats: delay, distract, and double down on growth.

Today, this takes the form of betting heavily on unproven or unscaled technologies while maintaining an economic model that assumes endless expansion on a finite planet. The promise is that we can continue growing without confronting the root causes of environmental breakdown, because future innovation will clean up the damage and smooth out the contradictions. But relying on speculative solutions while keeping the same growth logic intact is itself a form of inertia. It postpones the difficult choices and structural changes that a sustainable society requires.

Breaking through this inertia demands more than better arguments or smarter policy proposals. It requires persistent, organized pressure from below: people refusing to accept that destructive trajectories are inevitable, and insisting on alternatives grounded in ecological limits and justice. Activism—through protest, organizing, legal challenges, community building, and political engagement—creates the friction that can slow and redirect the system’s momentum.

Perseverance is essential. Social inertia does not yield quickly; it is reinforced by money, laws, infrastructure, and entrenched worldviews. Communication and action must therefore be sustained, clear, and courageous. By continually exposing the gap between local victories and global decline, challenging the myth of endless growth, and refusing to pin our hopes on unproven fixes, movements can help shift what societies see as possible and necessary.

The path to a sustainable society will not be delivered by momentum or by technology alone. It will be carved out by people who persist—who keep speaking, organizing, and acting until the weight of social inertia is finally overcome.
