Every June, the rainbow flag flies high as a symbol of hope, diversity, and the ongoing struggle for LGBTQ+ rights. At Greenpeace, this celebration of Pride is also a celebration of our own LGBTQ+ crews, staff, and supporters—people whose courage, creativity, and solidarity are woven into everything we do.

Out at sea, that rainbow spirit of diversity is reflected in the lives of the ocean’s inhabitants. While human ideas about sexuality and gender don’t map neatly onto animals, the natural world is full of behaviours and bodies that defy rigid categories—and, crucially, exist without prejudice.

Among young male orcas, for example, male-on-male sex has been observed. For these powerful marine mammals, intimacy and bonding don’t follow human rules, and there is no stigma attached to who they interact with.

Seahorses offer another striking reminder that nature doesn’t stick to binary expectations. Many seahorses are bisexual, and in these species it’s the males who become pregnant and give birth. This role reversal challenges assumptions about which bodies are “supposed” to do what.

High above the waves, some female albatrosses form pairs and raise young together. These long-lived seabirds show that successful families can be built on same-sex partnerships, with shared parenting and commitment that last for years.

On the seafloor, hermaphroditic starfish and sea urchins carry both male and female reproductive organs. For them, fluidity is simply a biological reality, not something to be debated or judged.

In coral reef communities, some wrasses begin life as female and later change into males, while clownfish do the opposite—starting out male and then becoming female. These transformations are part of the way their societies function, revealing yet another dimension of nature’s complexity.

All of this reminds us that the ocean is not just a place of staggering beauty and biodiversity; it is also a realm where life is expressed in endlessly varied ways. Humans share this planet with beings whose bodies, relationships, and life cycles stretch our imaginations and invite us to rethink what we consider “normal.”

As we honor Pride and the LGBTQ+ people who power the environmental movement, we also recognize how much we have in common with marine wildlife: complexity, adaptability, and the capacity to thrive in many different forms. And there is still so much more to discover beneath the waves.
