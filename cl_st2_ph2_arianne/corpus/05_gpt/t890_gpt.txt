Eight million people have raised their voices for the Arctic, and their message has travelled to one of the most remote and fragile places on Earth.

On board Greenpeace’s ship Arctic Sunrise, these calls for protection were carried into the icy waters of the Arctic Ocean, demanding an end to oil drilling and destructive fishing in this unique region. To help make those voices impossible to ignore, renowned pianist and composer Ludovico Einaudi joined the journey in Svalbard.

Amid ice and in front of a glacier, Einaudi performed a piece he composed especially for this moment: “Elegy for the Arctic.” Surrounded by the stark, vulnerable beauty of the Arctic seascape, his music became a powerful expression of what millions of people are asking for: urgent action to protect this vital part of our planet.

This performance was timed to coincide with a crucial political moment: the meeting of the OSPAR Commission in Tenerife. At this meeting, governments are considering a proposal to safeguard 10% of the Arctic Ocean. The urgency could not be greater, with Arctic ice melting and the region opening up to increased industrial interest.

Despite this, Norway, Denmark and Iceland are opposing the proposal, influenced by powerful corporate interests that see the Arctic not as a shared natural treasure, but as a new frontier for profit.

The reasons to protect the Arctic are clear and compelling. It is home to unique wildlife found nowhere else. It plays a vital role in regulating the global climate. It represents a legacy we owe to future generations. And it is a place where the world must draw a line against short‑term greed.

The Arctic Sunrise, the eight million voices behind it, and the notes of “Elegy for the Arctic” all carry the same message: the Arctic must be protected, and the time to act is now.
