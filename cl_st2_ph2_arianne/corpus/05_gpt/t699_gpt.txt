In the coming days, governments will meet at the United Nations in New York to negotiate what has been described as a historic last chance for the oceans: a Global Ocean Treaty that finally puts protection ahead of business interests.

Right now, the vast majority of the high seas – the waters beyond national borders that make up two-thirds of the world’s oceans – are essentially unprotected. These areas are home to incredible marine life and form a critical part of the Earth’s life support system, yet they remain wide open to exploitation.

Oceans provide habitat for countless species, food for communities around the world, and a huge share of the oxygen we breathe. But they are under mounting pressure from industrial fishing, plastic pollution, destructive seafloor mining activities, and the accelerating impacts of climate change. The result is an ocean in crisis, where ecosystems are being pushed towards collapse.

The Global Ocean Treaty under negotiation must give UN Member States the tools they need to turn this around. A strong treaty would allow countries to create fully protected ocean sanctuaries on the high seas, where harmful human activities are kept out so marine life can recover and thrive. Scientists and campaigners are calling for at least 30% of the world’s oceans to be protected in this way by 2030.

Today, only about 1% of the high seas is properly protected. That gap between what exists and what is needed shows how high the stakes are in New York. Without a robust agreement, the high seas will remain vulnerable to the same destructive forces that have already damaged so much of our blue planet.

Greenpeace will be in New York to push for a treaty that creates large, off-limits sanctuaries across the high seas. These safe havens would give whales, corals, and countless other species the space they need to recover from decades of overexploitation and to adapt, as much as possible, to a rapidly changing climate.

The decisions taken at these UN negotiations will help determine whether the high seas continue to be treated as a frontier for extraction, or finally become a shared global responsibility where protection comes first. With time running out for the oceans, this really is a last chance to chart a different course.
