Our food system is failing us. From the soil beneath our feet to the animals in factory farms, from the health of farmers to the food on our plates, the industrial model is built on chemicals, waste, and short-term profit rather than care for people and the planet.

The scale of the damage is staggering. In 2007, 269 tonnes of pesticides were used globally every hour. That means toxic chemicals being sprayed into the air we breathe, the water we drink, and the ecosystems that support life. This is not a marginal issue at the edges of agriculture; it is the operating system of industrial food production.

At the same time, this system is astonishingly wasteful. One-third of all food produced globally is wasted. That is not just a statistic about rotting leftovers; it represents land, water, energy, and labour thrown away. The amount of food wasted each year could feed 149 million people in Europe. While millions go hungry, mountains of edible food are discarded along the supply chain and in our homes.

The hidden cost of our diets is also measured in water. For just one person’s annual consumption of meat and dairy, an estimated 403,000 litres of water are used. Behind every steak, every glass of milk, every slice of cheese lies a vast, often invisible drain on rivers, aquifers, and freshwater ecosystems.

This is the reality of a broken industrial food system: chemical-intensive, resource-hungry, and indifferent to the wellbeing of farmers, communities, animals, and nature.

But this system is not inevitable, and it is not unchangeable.

Ecological farming offers a different path. It puts people and health at the centre, rather than chemicals and corporate control. It values biodiversity instead of monocultures, and it respects animals as living beings rather than treating them as units in a production line. Ecological farming integrates rigorous science with local knowledge, recognising that farmers and communities are not just end-users of technology, but co-creators of solutions.

This is not simply about changing how food is grown; it is about changing who the food system serves.

Individual choices can help drive that shift. Every time we buy ecological, local, and seasonal food, we support farming that works with nature instead of against it. When we choose to shop at farmers’ markets, we strengthen direct relationships between growers and eaters, keeping more value in local communities and reducing the distance food travels. When we eat less meat, we reduce pressure on land, water, and climate, and open space for more diverse, sustainable farming systems.

These actions may seem small, but together they build a people-powered movement. When enough of us demand ecological food and farming, markets respond. When markets shift, governments follow with policies and support that can scale up ecological practices and phase out chemical-intensive industrial agriculture.

The broken industrial food system is not just a policy problem or a scientific challenge; it is a democratic issue. Who decides what we grow, how we grow it, and who benefits? By changing what we put on our plates and where we spend our money, we reclaim some of that power.

The numbers on pesticides, food waste, and water use make it clear that the status quo is unsustainable. The promise of ecological farming shows that another future is possible—one where our food system nourishes people, protects farmers, restores biodiversity, and respects animals.

That future will not arrive on its own. It will be built, bite by bite and choice by choice, by all of us.
