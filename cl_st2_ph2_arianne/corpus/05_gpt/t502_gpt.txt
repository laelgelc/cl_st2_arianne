Rewilding offers a powerful, hopeful answer to the ecological crises we face, and its potential comes into sharp focus in the story of Knepp Estate. Once a struggling, intensively farmed landscape, Knepp was transformed when its owners made a radical decision: instead of battling against nature, they would step back and let it lead.

Guided by ideas from ecologist Franz Vera, they introduced free-roaming herbivores—cattle, pigs, ponies, and deer—and allowed these animals to shape the land. Rather than being managed as conventional livestock, the animals became ecosystem engineers. Their grazing, browsing, rooting, trampling, and movement created a constantly shifting mosaic of habitats, from scrub and woodland to grassland and wetland.

This change set off a chain reaction. As the land was released from intensive farming, the soil began to recover. Healthy soil is alive with microbes and other organisms that build structure, cycle nutrients, and support plant life. At Knepp, the restoration of these living communities beneath our feet went hand in hand with a resurgence of life above ground. Biodiversity returned in force, including rare insects, butterflies, birds, and orchids. These species were not “put back” one by one; they arrived as the conditions they needed—varied vegetation, undisturbed niches, and rich soils—slowly reappeared.

The process illustrates trophic cascades in action: when key species and natural processes are restored, their influence ripples through the food web. Large herbivores create and maintain habitats that different plants and animals can use at various stages. Their presence and behavior shape everything from vegetation patterns to insect populations and bird communities. In this way, animals are not just inhabitants of habitats; they are creators of them.

This stands in stark contrast to the impacts of intensive farming, which has driven widespread soil erosion and degradation. Repeated ploughing, heavy machinery, and high chemical inputs strip soil of its structure and life. When soil loses its microbial richness and resilience, entire ecosystems unravel. The Knepp experience underlines how crucial it is to see soil not as an inert medium for crops, but as a complex, living foundation for biodiversity and climate stability.

Rewilding challenges the assumption that humans must always tightly control landscapes to make them productive or “orderly.” Instead, it shows that stepping back—removing some pressures, reintroducing missing elements like free-roaming herbivores, and allowing natural processes to run—can unlock powerful self-restoring dynamics. Nature, given space and time, can heal.

This philosophy is echoed in other rewilding efforts, such as the reintroduction of wolves to Yellowstone. There, bringing back a top predator helped trigger trophic cascades that reshaped vegetation, waterways, and wildlife communities. Together with Knepp, these examples demonstrate that when we restore key species and processes, ecosystems can rebound in surprising and far-reaching ways.

Rewilding is not about turning back the clock to some imagined pristine past. It is about recognizing that healthy, functioning ecosystems depend on dynamic relationships among animals, plants, and soils—and that our best chance of addressing ecological breakdown lies in working with those relationships, not against them. By giving nature room to breathe and trusting its capacity to self-restore, we open the door to landscapes that are richer in life, more resilient, and better able to support all who depend on them.
