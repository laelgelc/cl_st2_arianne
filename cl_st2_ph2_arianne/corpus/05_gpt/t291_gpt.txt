Greenpeace Argentina’s recent overflight in Chaco province exposed a stark contradiction between law and reality on the ground. Despite a provincial suspension on clearing, 10,329 hectares of forest were destroyed between November 2020 and July 2021. From the air, bulldozers were seen operating in at least 10 different sites, pushing ahead with deforestation that should never have been allowed to happen.

This destruction is taking place in the Gran Chaco, South America’s second-largest forest. The Chaco is home to a rich diversity of species and is vital for around 4 million people, including Indigenous communities such as the Wichi and Qom. These communities depend directly on the forest for food, medicine, materials, and cultural continuity. When the forest is cleared, it is not only trees that disappear: ways of life, traditional knowledge, and community resilience are also eroded.

The main drivers of this deforestation are the expansion of agriculture and livestock production aimed at export markets. Forest is replaced with fields and pastures, prioritising short-term profit over long-term environmental and social stability. This model accelerates climate change by releasing carbon stored in trees and soils, and by dismantling a natural buffer that helps regulate local and regional climate patterns.

The consequences are increasingly visible. Deforestation in the Chaco intensifies droughts and contributes to more extreme storms, leaving communities more exposed to floods, crop failures, and water scarcity. At the same time, biodiversity is being destroyed as habitats are fragmented and species lose the space they need to survive. For Indigenous peoples, this means not only environmental damage but also the loss of the territories and ecosystems that underpin their rights, cultures, and livelihoods.

To change this trajectory, it is essential that forest laws are not only written but enforced. The suspension of clearing in Chaco must translate into real protection on the ground, with effective monitoring and sanctions that deter illegal activity. The evidence from the overflight shows that this is not yet happening at the scale required.

Stopping the advance of bulldozers is only one part of the solution. Protecting and restoring the Gran Chaco must be done in genuine collaboration with Indigenous communities, recognising their expertise and long-standing relationship with the forest. Their knowledge is crucial for identifying priority areas for conservation, guiding restoration efforts, and ensuring that any land-use decisions respect rights and sustain livelihoods.

The Chaco is at a crossroads. Continued deforestation will deepen the climate and biodiversity crises and further undermine the lives of those who depend on the forest. Enforcing existing laws and working hand in hand with Indigenous peoples offer a clear path to halt the destruction and begin restoring one of South America’s most important forest ecosystems.
