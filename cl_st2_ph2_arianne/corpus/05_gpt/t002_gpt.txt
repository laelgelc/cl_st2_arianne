Three young Nigerian women are using technology and creativity to tackle the climate crisis and pollution in their communities.

After witnessing severe floods in Kogi state – driven by a combination of unmanaged waste and climate change – Angel Chukwudi-Denis, Fortune Mmesomachukwu, and Favour Chinecherem decided to act. Together they formed Eco Elixirs and created EarthExp, an app designed to turn environmental education into an engaging, everyday experience.

EarthExp combines games, virtual reality, and social features to encourage people to change how they think and act toward the environment. Within the app, users build their own cities and are faced with choices that mirror real-world environmental challenges. Every decision – from how to manage waste to how much plastic to use – shapes the city’s future. By making eco-friendly choices, users see positive outcomes and learn how actions like reducing plastic pollution and preventing deforestation can protect the planet.

The app goes beyond passive learning. It rewards real-life climate-positive actions, such as planting trees, helping to connect digital learning with tangible change on the ground. Through these rewards, EarthExp aims to make sustainable behavior feel achievable and motivating, especially for young people.

EarthExp also amplifies and connects youth activism already emerging across Nigeria. This includes efforts to reuse waste materials instead of discarding them, as well as campaigns against gas flaring, which contributes to both local air pollution and global warming. By spotlighting and supporting these initiatives, the app helps build a sense of shared purpose and community among young climate activists.

At its core, EarthExp is about mindset change. By making environmental choices visible, interactive, and rewarding, Eco Elixirs are helping to inspire a new generation in Nigeria to see themselves as part of the solution and to imagine – and build – a more sustainable future.
