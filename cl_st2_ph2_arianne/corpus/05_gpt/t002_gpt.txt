When floods swept through Kogi state in Nigeria, they left more than damaged homes and disrupted lives. For three young women – Angel Chukwudi-Denis, Fortune Mmesomachukwu Somuadina, and Favour Chinecherem Chibuike – the devastation, made worse by climate change and plastic waste, became a turning point.

Witnessing their communities struggle with the impacts of rising waters and pollution, they decided to act. Together, they created Eco Elixirs Nigeria and developed EarthExp, an app designed to help people understand and respond to the environmental crises shaping their lives.

EarthExp, which has received a Technovation award, uses games, virtual reality, and social features to make complex environmental issues more accessible. Instead of abstract warnings about climate change, users can engage directly with environmental trends and see how their choices matter. The app encourages behavioral change by turning climate education into an interactive experience, while also connecting users so they can learn and act together.

Through EarthExp, people are guided to take practical steps such as planting trees and conserving water – actions that contribute to sustainability in tangible ways. In a country facing deforestation and pollution, these individual and collective efforts can help build more resilient communities.

The work of Eco Elixirs Nigeria is part of a wider wave of youth-led climate action across Africa. Young people are using technology, creativity, and community-building to confront the systems driving environmental destruction and to promote more sustainable ways of living. EarthExp stands as one example of how this generation is pushing back against harmful models of development and helping to shape a future that prioritises people and the planet.
