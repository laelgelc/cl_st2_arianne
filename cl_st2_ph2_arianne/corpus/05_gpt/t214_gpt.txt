The world is waking up to the fact that we cannot recycle our way out of the plastic crisis. Plastic production continues to rise, and with it, pollution in our oceans, rivers, soils, and communities. To turn the tide, we need to dramatically accelerate the shift from single-use to reuse and refill systems—backed by strong policies and global cooperation.

Across the globe, pressure is mounting on governments and corporations to move beyond incremental fixes and embrace real solutions. Reuse and refill systems are at the heart of this shift. They keep products and packaging in circulation for longer, reduce the need for virgin materials, and cut pollution and greenhouse gas emissions at the source.

Yet current efforts are far from sufficient. The Ellen MacArthur Foundation has highlighted that ambition on reuse within the consumer goods sector is still too low. Despite growing awareness and scattered pilot projects, most companies remain locked into single-use models. This lack of ambition stands in stark contrast to the scale of the plastic crisis and the clear potential of reuse.

At the same time, new alliances are forming to change course. The World Economic Forum has launched an initiative bringing together diverse stakeholders to advance reuse policies. By uniting businesses, policymakers, and other actors, this effort aims to build the enabling conditions—such as standards, infrastructure, and incentives—needed to scale reuse systems globally.

The environmental and economic benefits of reuse are significant. In the food and beverage sector alone, scaling reuse could save an estimated 27.1 million tonnes of resources by 2030. That means less extraction, less waste, and less pressure on ecosystems, while also opening up new economic opportunities in logistics, cleaning, repair, and service-based business models.

Policy is a critical driver of this transition. Around the world, governments are beginning to set reuse and refill on a firmer legal footing. Progressive laws in Austria, France, Portugal, Romania, Spain, Chile, India, and Indonesia are helping to push markets away from single-use and toward systems that prioritize reuse. These examples show that when governments act, they can spur innovation, create new jobs, and give businesses the certainty they need to invest in new models.

But national and regional measures alone are not enough to match the global scale of plastic pollution. That is why a strong, binding Global Plastics Treaty is essential. Such a treaty must go beyond waste management and recycling, and tackle the problem at its root by reducing plastic production and accelerating the adoption of reuse and refill systems worldwide. It should set clear, enforceable rules and targets that hold polluters accountable and support countries in implementing ambitious solutions.

The momentum is building: civil society, forward-looking businesses, and many governments are calling for a new plastics economy that works with, rather than against, the planet. Reuse and refill systems are central to that vision. With the right policies, international agreements, and sustained public pressure, we can move rapidly away from single-use and toward a future where products are delivered in ways that protect both people and the environment.
