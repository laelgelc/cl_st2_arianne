Smartphones have become an essential part of daily life across the globe, but the way they’re made, used, and discarded is putting workers’ health and the environment under serious strain. A recent Greenpeace survey of smartphone habits in the USA, Germany, Russia, Mexico, South Korea, and China reveals both the scale of the problem and the appetite for change.

One clear pattern emerges around repair: people in some countries are fixing their phones far more than others. In China, 66% of respondents said they repair their devices, and in South Korea the figure is 64%. In contrast, only 28% of respondents in the US and 23% in Germany reported repairing their phones. These differences matter because the longer a phone is used, the fewer new devices need to be produced and discarded.

Behind every smartphone are manufacturing processes that can involve hazardous chemicals. Substances like benzene and n-hexane are used in production and pose serious health risks to workers. The survey shows that people care deeply about this: four in five respondents said they prioritize phones made without such hazardous chemicals. This concern goes hand in hand with strong support for devices that are easier to repair and recycle. In China, up to 95% of respondents said ease of repair is a priority.

The survey also highlights frustration with the pace of new product releases. Over half of respondents believe manufacturers are putting too many models on the market and that companies themselves should be responsible for recycling old devices. This reflects a growing awareness that the current “take–make–waste” model is unsustainable.

The environmental burden is already immense. Smartphones alone generate nearly three million tonnes of electronic waste every year. This mountain of e-waste strains ecosystems, wastes valuable materials, and reflects a system built on short product lifespans and inadequate recycling.

Greenpeace is calling on the electronics industry to move toward truly sustainable gadgets—devices designed to last longer, be easily repaired, avoid hazardous chemicals, and be properly recycled at the end of their lives. The survey results show that people across very different countries are ready for this shift and are demanding better from manufacturers.

Changing the way smartphones are made and managed will require pressure on companies and policymakers, as well as informed choices by consumers. Greenpeace is inviting people everywhere to get involved in pushing for safer production, stronger repair and recycling systems, and a future where our essential gadgets don’t come at such a high cost to people and the planet.
