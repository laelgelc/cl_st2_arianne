On June 3, people across the world are coming together to send a clear message: there is no place for deep sea mining in a just, green future. This global day of action comes just days before governments gather in Jamaica for a crucial meeting of the International Seabed Authority, where they will decide whether to open the door to a destructive new industry on the ocean floor.

Deep sea mining has not yet begun on a commercial scale. That means there is still a real chance to stop it before it starts. The call to action is simple: join local events using an interactive map, stand with communities and ocean defenders, and demand that governments say no to deep sea mining.

The stakes could not be higher. If governments fail to reach an agreement that protects the oceans, deep sea mining companies could be allowed to plunder the seabed. This would put little-known deep sea species at risk, undermine vital carbon sinks that help regulate the climate, and threaten the cultural and spiritual connections that many Pacific communities have with the ocean. For these communities, the deep sea is not a distant frontier to be exploited, but part of a living, interconnected home.

The push to mine the deep ocean is often wrapped in green-sounding promises, with companies claiming it will support the transition to clean technologies. But communities, scientists, and activists are exposing how this narrative masks greenwashing and a new wave of neocolonialism. Once again, powerful interests are targeting Pacific waters and Indigenous territories for extraction, while those who depend on the ocean bear the risks.

The June 3 mobilization echoes past fights to keep offshore oil drilling out of sensitive marine areas. Just as people organized to prevent new rigs and pipelines—and the climate pollution and oil spills that come with them—this movement is working to stop a new extractive rush before it can cause irreversible damage.

Everyone can play a part. People are encouraged to:

- Join or organize an action using the interactive map.
- Share a campaign video to raise awareness and build pressure on governments.
- Call on leaders to support a moratorium on deep sea mining.

This moment also connects directly to World Oceans Day on June 8 and the momentum created by the new Global Ocean Treaty. Together, these are opportunities to shift from exploiting the seas to protecting them—expanding marine safeguards instead of opening up the last untouched frontier to industrial mining.

By standing together on June 3, people around the world can show that the oceans are not a sacrifice zone. They are central to climate stability, biodiversity, and cultures—and they must be defended before it is too late.
