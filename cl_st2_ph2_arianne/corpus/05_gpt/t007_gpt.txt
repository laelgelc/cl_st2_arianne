On June 3, people around the world are coming together for a global day of action to oppose deep sea mining, just days before governments meet at the International Seabed Authority in Jamaica to decide the future of our oceans. This is a critical moment: governments have so far failed to agree on ocean protection, leaving the door open for deep sea mining to begin as early as this year.

This global day of action is a chance to show that people everywhere refuse to let that happen. Anyone can take part by joining events listed on the shared map, standing alongside communities and activists who are demanding that governments stop this destructive new industry before it starts. The same kind of public pressure has helped prevent offshore oil drilling in the past and is essential now to avoid new ecological and climate crises in the deep ocean.

Deep sea mining threatens to wipe out species before they are even discovered, destroy fragile deep sea ecosystems, and disturb important carbon sinks on the ocean floor. These risks extend far beyond the mining sites themselves, affecting the health of the entire ocean. Pacific communities, in particular, face serious impacts to their livelihoods, cultures, and marine environments if mining is allowed to go ahead in their waters.

The push for deep sea mining is also tied to neocolonial patterns of exploitation and corporate greenwashing. Mining companies are trying to present deep sea extraction as a “green” solution for the energy transition, while ignoring the people and ecosystems that would bear the costs. Stopping this industry is about protecting life in the ocean and resisting another wave of resource extraction imposed on vulnerable regions.

Everyone can help build resistance by joining an event on June 3, sharing the campaign video, and spreading the word. World Oceans Day on June 8 offers another key moment to keep the pressure on governments, using the momentum of the Global Ocean Treaty to push back against deep sea mining. Together, these days of action can show leaders at the International Seabed Authority that the world is watching and that deep sea mining has no social license to operate.
