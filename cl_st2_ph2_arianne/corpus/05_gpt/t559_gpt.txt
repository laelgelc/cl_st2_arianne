Photography has always been a powerful way to tell the truth about our world. On World Photography Day, images from 2019 show how a single frame can reveal both the scale of environmental destruction and the courage of those who stand up to stop it.

In Norway, activists climbing an oil rig to protest Arctic drilling turned a distant political issue into something immediate and human. The height of the rig, the cold, the vulnerability of people suspended above the sea—all of it captured in photographs—made the risks of fossil fuel expansion and the determination of those resisting it impossible to ignore.

In Brazil, the Acampamento Terra Livre indigenous assembly brought together communities demanding their rights and the demarcation of their territories. Photographs from the gathering showed faces, colours, traditional dress, and collective strength, documenting a struggle that is often reduced to statistics and legal terms. These images made visible the people on the frontlines of defending forests, culture, and land.

In the United States, flooding in Louisiana after Hurricane Barry showed streets turned into rivers and homes surrounded by water. Photographs of these scenes connected extreme weather to real lives and neighbourhoods, underlining how climate impacts are already unfolding.

In South Korea, fires lit up the landscape, with images capturing smoke, flames, and scorched ground. These photographs drew attention to the intensity and destructiveness of such events, and to the vulnerability of communities and ecosystems in their path.

In the Philippines, a crab trapped in plastic waste provided a stark, intimate view of the pollution crisis. The image of a single animal ensnared in human-made debris conveyed, in an instant, what words often struggle to express about plastic choking the oceans and coastlines.

In Brazil again, the collapse of a Vale dam was recorded in photographs of devastation and mud. These images showed the human and environmental cost of industrial disasters, and how entire landscapes can be transformed in moments.

In Indonesia, photographs of coal plant expansion highlighted the machinery, infrastructure, and scale of fossil fuel development. The images made visible the reality behind abstract discussions of “energy policy,” showing how coal continues to shape skylines and communities.

Around the world, #FridaysForFuture student strikes filled streets with young people demanding climate action. Photographs of these marches captured banners, chants, and the sheer number of students walking out of classrooms to protect their future. These images became symbols of a growing global movement.

From pole to pole, Greenpeace’s ocean expedition documented threats like climate change and pollution in some of the planet’s most remote waters. Photographs from this journey showed icy seas, research in action, and fragile marine environments under pressure, connecting distant oceans to the choices made on land.

Together, these 2019 images show how photography can expose injustice, honour resistance, and inspire action. Each photograph is a witness: to damage, to resilience, and to the possibility of change when people see clearly what is at stake.
