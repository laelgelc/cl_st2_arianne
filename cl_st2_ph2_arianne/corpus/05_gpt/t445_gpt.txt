The world is facing a triple crisis: public health, economic collapse, and accelerating ecological breakdown. These crises are deeply interconnected and demand solutions that are both urgent and just. As countries struggle to respond to the impacts of COVID-19, many in the global south remain trapped in a cycle of debt that forces them to choose between protecting their people and protecting the profits of creditors.

Unconditional international debt cancellation for countries in the global south is essential to enable a real post-COVID recovery. Without it, governments are pushed to sacrifice public health, social protection, and environmental safeguards in order to keep up with unsustainable debt repayments. This undermines the possibility of building economies that are resilient, fair, and compatible with the limits of the planet.

Debt burdens drive governments toward extractivist economic models that depend on large-scale exploitation of nature. To service their debts, many countries are pressured to expand mining, fossil fuel extraction, industrial agriculture, and other destructive activities. This leads to deforestation, pollution, land conflicts, and the erosion of biodiversity at exactly the moment when the world needs to move in the opposite direction.

Argentina illustrates how this dynamic plays out. Confronted with the risk of defaulting on a debt of $65 billion, the country faces immense pressure to prioritize debt repayment over social and environmental needs. This situation shows how the global financial system can lock countries into harmful economic pathways, even as they confront public health emergencies and climate and biodiversity crises.

Freeing countries from these debt traps is a precondition for a just and green future. With debt cancelled, resources could be redirected toward building economies that are compatible with life and dignity: strengthening public health systems, supporting workers and communities, and investing in climate and nature solutions. This includes committing to zero deforestation, ending the expansion of fossil fuels and destructive mineral extraction, and restoring ecosystems that have been degraded or destroyed.

A truly sustainable recovery also requires learning from and respecting the knowledge and practices of Indigenous Peoples. Their ways of living with and caring for the land offer vital lessons for how to safeguard ecosystems, protect biodiversity, and maintain cultural and community resilience. Supporting Indigenous rights and leadership must be part of any serious strategy to confront ecological breakdown.

Greenpeace is calling for immediate and unconditional cancellation of unsustainable debts for countries in the global south, along with emergency finance that does not create new debt. Such support must enable governments to prioritize health, wellbeing, and ecological integrity over austerity and extraction. Instead of being forced to exploit their natural resources to pay creditors, countries must have the freedom and means to shift toward economic models that respect planetary boundaries and human rights.

This moment of overlapping crises is also a moment of choice. By cancelling debt and providing non-debt-creating finance, the international community can help unlock a path away from extractivism and toward a future defined by justice, care, and ecological restoration.
