More than 4,000 Indigenous people gathered in Brasília, Brazil, for the 15th Free Land Camp, the world’s largest Indigenous mobilization. Over several days, music, dances, rituals and the exchange of knowledge filled the camp, creating a powerful space for culture, resistance and collective strength.

On the second day, Indigenous leaders raised their voices to demand concrete government action to protect their territories. Their call came in direct response to the weakening of environmental laws under the Bolsonaro government, which has left forests and communities increasingly vulnerable.

The camp concluded with a traditional march through Brasília. This peaceful demonstration of resistance made visible, once again, the determination of Indigenous Peoples to defend their lands, cultures and rights.

Indigenous communities are on the frontlines of the struggle to protect forests from deforestation. Their territories are vital barriers against the destruction of nature that is driving more extreme weather around the world. Supporting these guardians means supporting the protection of forests and the stability of the global climate.
