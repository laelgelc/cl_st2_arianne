For years, Gibson Dunn & Crutcher has tried to cultivate a reputation as a high-end corporate law firm. But its track record in some of the world’s most notorious environmental and human rights cases tells a very different story—one marked by sanctions, fabricated evidence, and legal misconduct deployed to shield powerful polluters from accountability.

In the landmark pollution case brought by Ecuadorian communities against Chevron for massive contamination in the Amazon, Gibson Dunn played a central role in a scorched-earth legal strategy that went far beyond legitimate advocacy. Rather than focus on the underlying environmental damage and the rights of affected people, the firm helped Chevron turn its fire on the victims, their lawyer Steven Donziger, and even the Ecuadorian judiciary itself.

In New York, under the watch of Judge Lewis Kaplan, Gibson Dunn helped Chevron weaponize SLAPP suits—Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation—and aggressive RICO (Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act) claims to attack those who dared to challenge the company. These tactics are designed not simply to win a case, but to intimidate, exhaust, and silence critics by burying them in litigation. When powerful corporations use SLAPP suits, backed by firms like Gibson Dunn, it becomes a direct threat to free speech and to communities’ ability to organize and demand justice.

The conduct in the New York proceedings has been riddled with serious concerns. Allegations have surfaced of judicial bias, including a court that appeared more interested in undermining the Ecuadorian judgment than in examining Chevron’s pollution. Privileges were waived in ways that raised fundamental fairness questions. Most disturbingly, Gibson Dunn’s case leaned heavily on testimony from Alberto Guerra, a former Ecuadorian judge who later admitted he had lied. Guerra’s role has been tainted by allegations that he was effectively bribed, with substantial benefits provided in exchange for his cooperation. This is not the behavior of a firm seeking truth; it is the behavior of a firm willing to manipulate the process to protect its client.

The trial itself was marred by irregularities that would be unthinkable in a proceeding genuinely aimed at justice. Key evidence and perspectives from the affected communities were sidelined while Chevron and Gibson Dunn were allowed to reframe the narrative around alleged “fraud” by the victims and their lawyers. In the end, Judge Kaplan ruled against the Ecuadorian communities and Donziger, adopting much of the story advanced by Chevron and Gibson Dunn.

Yet outside the narrow confines of Kaplan’s courtroom, the ruling has failed to gain traction. Foreign courts have declined to give effect to his decision, effectively refusing to import the deeply flawed reasoning and tainted record that underpinned it. That rejection speaks volumes: when other judicial systems look at what happened in New York, they do not see a reliable judgment—they see a case saturated with corporate overreach and legal abuse.

Gibson Dunn’s history of sanctions for fabricating evidence, lying, and other misconduct cannot be separated from its role in this saga. When a law firm repeatedly crosses ethical lines to defend corporate polluters, it becomes part of the machinery that enables environmental destruction and human rights abuses to continue unchecked. By helping Chevron attack its critics instead of addressing the underlying contamination, Gibson Dunn has contributed to a chilling message: that those who stand up to powerful fossil fuel interests can be targeted, smeared, and dragged through years of retaliatory litigation.

SLAPP suits and distorted RICO claims are not just legal instruments; they are tools of intimidation that undermine democracy and silence communities on the frontlines of environmental harm. As long as firms like Gibson Dunn are willing to deploy these tactics, the fight for climate justice will have to confront not only the polluters themselves, but also the lawyers who work to shield them from accountability.

The Ecuadorian pollution victims and their allies have shown extraordinary courage in the face of this onslaught. Their struggle exposes a stark truth: when corporate power is paired with law firms willing to bend or break the rules, the courtroom can become another battleground where justice is delayed, distorted, or denied. That is why challenging SLAPP suits, exposing legal misconduct, and holding firms like Gibson Dunn to account is essential—not just for one case, but for the broader fight to protect human rights, the environment, and the basic right to speak out.
