Greenpeace activists have taken their message straight to the heart of EU decision-making by scaling the 14-storey European Commission headquarters in Brussels. High above the city, they unfurled a huge banner and spread ashes across the building’s façade – a stark symbol of the fires raging in the Amazon and the struggles of Indigenous peoples on the frontlines of forest destruction.

This action targets Europe’s role in driving global deforestation. The EU is responsible for importing 36% of all globally traded products linked to deforestation, including beef, palm oil and soy. These imports alone account for more than 10% of forest loss worldwide. While forests are being cleared and burned, Indigenous communities are seeing their lands and rights violated so that companies can profit from commodities entering European markets.

More than a decade ago, major companies pledged to eliminate deforestation from their supply chains by 2020. That deadline has passed, and they have failed to deliver. Forests are still being destroyed for products that end up on European supermarket shelves, in animal feed, and in everyday consumer goods.

This is why Greenpeace is calling for a strong EU law that bans products linked to deforestation and human rights abuses from entering the European market. Voluntary commitments have not worked. Binding rules are needed to stop the EU’s complicity in forest destruction and to help protect Indigenous peoples and the ecosystems they defend.

Right now, the European Commission is running a public consultation on this issue. It is a crucial opportunity for people across Europe and beyond to demand ambitious legislation that keeps deforestation-linked products out of the EU and upholds human rights. By taking part in the consultation, the public can send a clear message to decision-makers: Europe must stop fueling forest destruction and stand with the communities who are protecting the world’s forests.
