McDonald’s, KFC, and Burger King have enormous power over what happens in the Amazon – and they must use it.

Right now, global pressure on Brazil’s President Bolsonaro is intense. Governments, scientists, Indigenous communities, and millions of people worldwide are calling for protection of the Amazon. But political leaders often move only when economic pressure becomes impossible to ignore. Fast food giants are some of the most powerful corporate players tied to Brazil’s agricultural industry. If they publicly and forcefully oppose Amazon destruction, they can help tip the balance and make it harder for Bolsonaro to ignore the global outcry.

The stakes could not be higher. The Amazon is crucial for stabilising the global climate. It stores vast amounts of carbon and helps regulate temperatures worldwide. Its forests generate huge volumes of water vapour that influence rainfall patterns far beyond South America. This system underpins food production and helps prevent the kind of extreme droughts, famines, heatwaves, and storms that are becoming more frequent in a warming world. The forest is also home to Indigenous Peoples and extraordinary biodiversity. When the Amazon is burned or cleared, the impacts ripple across the planet and fall hardest on those who did least to cause the crisis.

McDonald’s, KFC, and Burger King are directly linked to this destruction through their supply chains. They buy beef from Brazil and rely on chicken fed with soya grown there. In many cases, forests are deliberately set on fire to clear land for cattle ranching and industrial agriculture. These are not accidental blazes; they are part of a system that turns forest into feedlots and fields. By continuing to purchase beef and soya-fed chicken connected to this model, these fast food companies are helping to fuel the very fires that are destroying the Amazon.

This is especially serious because they have already promised to end deforestation in their supply chains. Despite these commitments, they continue sourcing from suppliers involved in forest destruction and keep driving up global demand for meat. That demand is a key force behind the expansion of cattle ranches and soya plantations into the Amazon and other threatened ecosystems. When promises to end deforestation are not matched by real changes in sourcing and menus, they become part of the problem rather than the solution.

Other companies are showing that a different path is possible. Brands like H&M, Timberland, and Vans have taken steps to distance themselves from products linked to Brazilian deforestation. Salmon producers and major investors have also started to act, using their purchasing power and financial leverage to send a clear signal that ongoing forest destruction is unacceptable. This growing movement exposes how far behind McDonald’s, KFC, and Burger King now are.

These fast food giants have the reach, influence, and responsibility to help protect the Amazon. By cutting ties with destructive suppliers, reducing their role in driving meat demand, and publicly opposing forest destruction in Brazil, they can help shift both markets and politics. With the Amazon’s future – and our shared climate – on the line, silence is not a neutral position.
