Jennifer Morgan shares a stark message: the impacts scientists have long warned about are no longer distant predictions, but lived reality. As she travels to the IPCC meeting in Incheon, she carries both deep concern and a powerful sense of possibility.

Her worry comes from seeing climate change unfold in real time. What was once discussed as “future risk” is now visible in extreme weather, rising seas, and the disruption of lives and livelihoods. Yet on her way to the negotiations, she draws strength from stories around the world that show how people are refusing to accept a future defined by climate breakdown.

In Switzerland, a group of grandmothers is taking their own government to court, demanding stronger protection for their health and their grandchildren’s future. In Lebanon, young people are building solar panels, creating clean energy solutions with their own hands. In Turkey, communities are standing up for nature and their rights, blocking the cutting of olive trees to make way for a coal plant. In Germany, people are defending Hambach Forest, turning it into a symbol of resistance to fossil fuels.

Jennifer is also moved by the courage of young people. A Swedish girl is boycotting school to demand climate action, refusing to carry on as if everything is normal. In the United States, students are suing their government for failing to protect them from the climate crisis, insisting that their right to a livable future must be taken seriously.

Her sense of urgency is personal. Growing up on the Jersey Shore, she remembers the coastline as a place of childhood joy. That same shoreline was transformed by Hurricane Sandy, a stark reminder of how quickly the familiar can be reshaped by a warming world. For her, these changes are not abstract—they are etched into the places she loves.

Amid this loss and disruption, she sees frontline communities showing remarkable resilience. From courtrooms to forests, from classrooms to coastlines, people are coming together to protect what they cherish. Their actions form a tapestry of resistance and renewal that stretches across borders.

Jennifer’s message is that despair is understandable, but it cannot be where we stop. The stories she carries to Incheon show that when people act together—whether by protesting, building alternatives, or demanding justice—they can turn fear into determination. She urges us to join this growing wave of action, so that our shared worry becomes a source of unstoppable hope.
