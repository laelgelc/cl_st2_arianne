Jim Bohlen’s life traced a path from wartime service to a lifetime of peace and environmental activism that helped shape Greenpeace and the modern environmental movement.

Born in 1926 in New York City, Bohlen served as a US Navy radio operator before returning home to earn an engineering degree. His technical training and military experience would later intersect in unexpected ways with his growing commitment to peace and environmental protection.

In the late 1960s, Bohlen moved to Vancouver, Canada. As a Quaker deeply opposed to the Vietnam War, he quickly became involved in the local peace movement. In 1968, at an anti-war protest, he met Irving and Dorothy Stowe. That meeting brought him into the orbit of a small but determined group of activists. Bohlen joined the Sierra Club, and together with the Stowes and others, he began to connect opposition to war with concern for the environment.

By 1969, the group turned its attention to US nuclear tests at Amchitka, a remote island in Alaska. Horrified by the threat these tests posed, they formed the Don’t Make a Wave Committee to oppose them. The group searched for a way to capture public attention and bring moral pressure to bear on the US government.

The turning point came from an idea by Bohlen’s wife, Marie: sail a boat directly to the test site. Bohlen announced the plan publicly, sparking a wave of support and fundraising that made the voyage possible. The chartered fishing boat Phyllis Cormack set out for Amchitka, carrying a small crew of activists determined to confront nuclear testing at sea.

The voyage did more than challenge a single test. As the Don’t Make a Wave Committee evolved, the protest took on a new name: Greenpeace. The Amchitka action helped delay the nuclear tests and contributed to their eventual end, demonstrating the power of non-violent direct action and international public pressure.

Bohlen remained committed to anti-nuclear activism into the 1980s. Even after retiring in 1987, he did not step away from public life. Instead, he continued to champion alternatives to nuclear power and fossil fuels, advocating renewable energy as a Green Party candidate.

Jim Bohlen died on July 5, 2010, at the age of 84. He is survived by his family and by Greenpeace, the organisation he helped found through his courage, creativity, and unwavering commitment to peace and the environment.
