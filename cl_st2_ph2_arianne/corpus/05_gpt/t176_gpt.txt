Across Europe and around the world, people are standing up against Vladimir Putin’s brutal invasion of Ukraine. The images and stories emerging from the war have sparked grief, anger, and a determination to act. In streets, public squares, and online spaces, ordinary people are demanding peace, justice, and real solidarity with those whose lives have been torn apart.

That solidarity is taking many forms. People are donating money to humanitarian organisations, joining protests, and opening their homes and communities to refugees fleeing the violence. These actions matter. They send a clear message that aggression and war will not be met with indifference, and that people in Ukraine are not alone.

But solidarity is not just about what we give; it is also about what we refuse to support. Right now, Russian fossil fuels are helping to finance Putin’s war machine. Oil, gas, and coal money is flowing into the Kremlin and enabling the continued assault on Ukraine. Ending this flow of money is a vital part of building a path to peace.

That is why attention is turning to the banks and investors that continue to bankroll Russian fossil fuels. Financial giants such as Credit Suisse, Schroders, Pictet, East Capital, Carnegie Fonder, Intesa SanPaolo, UniCredit, Société Générale, Raiffeisen Bank International, and UBS are under growing pressure to cut their ties. Their investments and services help keep Russian fossil fuel companies in business, and in doing so, they help keep the war funded.

Across Europe, people are taking this message directly to the financial sector. In Vienna and the Czech Republic, protests are shining a spotlight on banks that still have financial links to Russian fossil fuel projects. Activists, customers, and citizens are calling on these institutions to stop financing the fuels that are driving both war and climate chaos.

The demand is simple: stop pouring money into fossil fuels that fuel conflict, and start directing it into renewable energy that supports peace. By shifting investments away from coal, oil, and gas and into clean energy, banks and investors can help cut off a key source of funding for war while accelerating the transition to a safer, more stable energy system.

This moment is also a reckoning for European institutions that helped build Putin’s power over many years through their financial and energy decisions. Their support for fossil fuel projects has deepened dependence on Russian oil and gas and strengthened the very system that now wages war on Ukraine. That history cannot be undone, but it can—and must—be changed.

Redirecting money from destructive fossil fuels to renewables is not just a climate necessity; it is a peace strategy. Every euro that leaves Russian fossil fuel projects and moves into wind, solar, energy efficiency, and other clean solutions is a step away from violence and towards a more secure future.

People across Europe are already showing what solidarity looks like: donating, protesting, and supporting refugees. Now banks and investors must do their part. Ending the financing of Russian fossil fuels and backing a rapid shift to renewables is a concrete, powerful way to stand with Ukraine and help build a more peaceful world.
