The Arctic is one of the planet’s most vital climate regulators, yet it is changing at an alarming pace. This remote region, home to threatened wildlife such as polar bears and narwhals, is warming twice as fast as the global average. This phenomenon, known as Arctic amplification, is reshaping not only the polar environment but also the stability of weather systems worldwide.

A key driver of this rapid warming is the loss of sea ice. Bright, ice-covered surfaces reflect a large share of the sun’s energy back into space, a property known as albedo. As the Arctic warms and sea ice melts, darker ocean water is exposed. Instead of reflecting sunlight, this darker surface absorbs more heat, causing further warming and even more ice loss. This creates a powerful positive feedback loop that accelerates climate change in the region.

The impacts of this feedback loop reach far beyond the Arctic Circle. As sea ice declines and temperatures rise, atmospheric circulations and the jet streams are altered. These fast-flowing air currents help steer weather systems, and when they are disrupted, weather patterns can become more extreme and less predictable. The result is an increased likelihood of super-storms, prolonged droughts, and severe floods.

These extreme events carry a heavy human and economic toll. Communities around the world are already experiencing the consequences, from destroyed homes and infrastructure to lost livelihoods and rising costs of recovery and adaptation. What happens in the Arctic does not stay in the Arctic; its destabilization is directly linked to the safety and well-being of people everywhere.

Despite its global importance, the Arctic still lacks robust international protection. Its ecosystems, which underpin both biodiversity and climate stability, remain vulnerable to escalating pressures. Greenpeace is calling for the creation of ecosystem-based protected areas in the region—an approach that safeguards entire habitats and the complex web of life they support.

Central to this vision is the establishment of an Arctic Sanctuary: a protected area designed to shield this critical region from further harm and help preserve its role in stabilizing the global climate. Public support is essential to make this a reality. By standing behind the call for an Arctic Sanctuary, people everywhere can help protect polar wildlife, defend communities from escalating climate impacts, and safeguard one of Earth’s most important climate guardians.
