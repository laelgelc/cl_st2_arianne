The Kunming-Montreal Agreement, adopted at the COP15 UN Biodiversity Conference, has been celebrated as a historic step forward—but it is only a beginning in the effort to halt mass extinction.

At the heart of the agreement is long-overdue recognition of the central role played by Indigenous Peoples in protecting life on Earth. Although they make up only about 5% of the global population, Indigenous Peoples safeguard 80% of the world’s remaining biodiversity. The agreement underscores the importance of respecting their rights and territories, and of ensuring their free, prior and informed consent and full participation, in line with the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Moving forward, Indigenous-led conservation must not be treated as an exception or a side initiative; it needs to become the standard approach to protecting nature.

One of the headline commitments in the Kunming-Montreal Agreement is the target to protect at least 30% of the world’s land and seas by 2030. This target has been widely promoted as a major win for nature. However, the agreement does not explicitly rule out damaging activities within protected areas. At the same time, it opens the door to corporate-led schemes such as many “nature-based solutions,” which can be used to greenwash harmful practices and create new forms of exploitation rather than genuinely restore ecosystems. Without strong safeguards, these mechanisms risk turning nature into a commodity and undermining the very goals the agreement sets out to achieve.

Finance is another critical weak point. The commitments made so far fall short of what is needed to address the biodiversity crisis at the scale and speed required. The agreement points to the need for increased and accelerated funding, particularly for developing countries and Indigenous Peoples, who are often on the frontlines of both biodiversity protection and climate impacts. A key test will be the establishment of a dedicated fund in 2023 to support their efforts. This funding must be timely, sufficient, and accessible if the agreement is to move from words on paper to real-world change.

Protecting biodiversity on land cannot be separated from protecting the ocean. To complement the Kunming-Montreal Agreement, governments must also deliver a strong Global Ocean Treaty capable of creating and effectively managing marine protected areas on the high seas. Ocean governance remains a major gap in global environmental protection, and a robust treaty is essential to close it.

The Kunming-Montreal Agreement sets a framework and sends an important signal, but it does not itself guarantee an end to biodiversity loss. Implementation, enforcement, and genuine power shifts toward Indigenous Peoples and local communities will determine whether this “historic” deal leads to historic results. COP16, to be held in Türkiye in 2024, will be a crucial moment to build on the commitments made at COP15, strengthen the protections, and ensure that promises are translated into concrete action for people and the planet.
