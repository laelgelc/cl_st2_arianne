Animated films can be powerful tools for exposing environmental injustices and inspiring people to act. In 2021, a series of animations shone a light on stories that are too often ignored, while offering visions of a fairer, greener future.

One of the most compelling collections comes from WoMin, centring African women’s resistance to resource theft. These animations share how women are standing up to destructive industries, defending land, water and community rights, and imagining alternative ways of living that put people and the planet first. Their visions for a better world challenge the idea that exploitation is inevitable and show how grassroots resistance can open pathways to justice.

Another animation, “A Plastic Story”, warns about the legacy of plastic pollution that today’s generations are leaving behind. It highlights how plastic waste does not simply disappear; it accumulates, spreading across communities and ecosystems, and risks being passed on to future generations. The film calls on viewers to confront this reality and consider how our choices today shape the world our children will inherit.

Several of the 2021 animations turn a critical eye on the global plastic trade. They expose how the UK exports plastic waste abroad rather than dealing with it at home, shifting the burden onto other countries and communities. They also reveal how some of the world’s biggest brands are deeply tied to fossil fuels, with plastic production locking us into continued oil and gas extraction. By making these hidden connections visible, the films challenge greenwashing narratives that present plastic as easily recyclable or harmless.

Conversations with climate justice activists form another important strand of these animations. Through their voices, viewers hear directly from people on the frontlines of the climate crisis—those who are already experiencing the impacts of pollution, extreme weather and environmental destruction. These discussions emphasise that climate change is not just an environmental issue but a question of justice, human rights and power.

The blog also highlights animated exposés of TotalEnergies’ greenwashing and carbon offsetting scams. These films show how glossy promises of “net zero” and “offsetting” can mask ongoing fossil fuel expansion and harm to communities and ecosystems. Instead of delivering real emissions cuts, such schemes often allow business as usual to continue, while claiming climate leadership.

Across all these animations, a common thread runs through: the need for real change and collective action. The blog encourages people to share the videos, sign petitions linked to the campaigns they support, and explore more animations that imagine and demand a green, just future. By amplifying these stories and calls to action, viewers can help build the pressure needed to confront environmental injustice and push for systemic transformation.
