Standing on the shores of Svalbard, the Arctic doesn’t feel distant or abstract. It feels immediate, fragile, and under pressure.

Jennifer Morgan, Greenpeace International’s Executive Director, travelled there to witness how quickly the Arctic is changing as the climate crisis accelerates. The ice is melting, temperatures are rising, and the impacts are no longer hidden in remote corners – they are written across the landscape and the lives of the animals that depend on it.

Along the coastline, one of the most visible scars is the trash washing up on the beaches. Most of it comes from industrial fisheries. What might look like a remote, pristine shore is in reality littered with ropes, nets, and plastic debris. This pollution is not just an eyesore; it is a direct threat to life in the Arctic.

Reindeer, polar bears, seabirds and other wildlife are being harmed by this constant stream of waste. Animals become entangled in fishing gear or ingest plastic, mistaking it for food. These encounters can be deadly, adding another layer of pressure to species already struggling with rapidly changing sea ice and habitat loss driven by global heating.

To confront this, a beach clean-up was organised under Greenpeace’s ‘Protect What You Love’ campaign. The clean-up did more than remove trash from one stretch of coastline; it helped expose the scale of the problem and connect it to the wider issue of destructive fishing practices, particularly bottom trawling. This method of fishing drags heavy gear across the seafloor, damaging fragile marine ecosystems and contributing to the broader crisis facing the Arctic Ocean.

There has been a step forward. Through Greenpeace’s efforts, a voluntary agreement has been brokered within the fishing industry to avoid expanding cod fishing into untouched areas of the northern Barents Sea. This is a recognition from parts of the industry that some areas must remain off-limits if we are to give the Arctic a chance.

But voluntary measures are not enough to match the speed and severity of the changes underway. Jennifer Morgan is calling on Norway to turn this recognition into lasting protection by establishing strong, legal safeguards for marine areas in the Barents Sea. Without binding rules, the Arctic’s remaining relatively untouched waters remain vulnerable to future industrial expansion.

What is happening in Svalbard is a stark reminder that the Arctic is on the frontline of the climate and nature crisis. Protecting it means confronting both the pollution and the destructive practices that are pushing this unique region – and the wildlife that calls it home – to the brink.
