For four months, the Greenpeace ship Arctic Sunrise sailed across the Indian Ocean, documenting how destructive fishing, pollution, and climate breakdown are transforming one of the most important – and vulnerable – regions on Earth. Along the way, the crew met people whose lives are deeply tied to the sea, and whose stories reveal what is at stake for wildlife, ecosystems, and entire communities.

In Mauritius, Seychelles, and Madagascar, industrial fishing fleets operate on a scale that local fishers cannot match. These industrial activities strip the ocean of life and threaten the livelihoods of coastal communities who have depended on small-scale fishing for generations. At the same time, pollution and the impacts of climate breakdown are putting even more pressure on already stressed ecosystems. Coral reefs, mangroves, and coastal waters are all feeling the combined effects of warming, overfishing, and contamination.

The Arctic Sunrise voyage was not only about documenting damage; it was also about listening. Out of this commitment to centre local experiences came the Vital Ocean Voices project, which supports people across the Indian Ocean region to share their own stories in their own words. Through writing, videos, animations, and poems, Vital Ocean Voices gives a platform to those who live with the ocean every day and see its changes up close.

One of these voices is Kylian, who recounts responding to an oil spill – a stark example of how pollution can devastate coastlines and the people who depend on them. Another is Madame Kokoly from Madagascar, whose experiences as a fisher show how changing seas and destructive fishing practices directly affect food security and income. Aurelie shares her personal connection to the ocean, reflecting how culture, identity, and community are intertwined with marine life and healthy coasts.

In Seychelles, the project highlights efforts to rehabilitate mangroves, vital ecosystems that protect shorelines, provide nursery grounds for marine species, and store carbon. School pupils also feature in these stories, showing how young people are taking action in their own communities to protect the environment and advocate for a better future.

Together, the journey of the Arctic Sunrise and the Vital Ocean Voices project reveal a shared reality across the Indian Ocean: industrial fishing, pollution, and climate breakdown are eroding the foundations of life at sea and on land. But they also show that people on the frontlines are organising, caring for damaged ecosystems, and speaking out. By supporting and amplifying these firsthand accounts, Vital Ocean Voices helps ensure that the experiences of coastal communities are heard, recognised, and placed at the heart of efforts to protect the ocean.
