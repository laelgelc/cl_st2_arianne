Elisabeth Stern of Swiss Senior Women for Climate Protection speaks from a place of deep concern and long experience. She is angered that young climate activists are being condemned and criminalised while those who profit from fossil fuels continue to thrive. For her, this contrast exposes a profound injustice: the people sounding the alarm about the climate crisis are punished, while those driving the crisis are rewarded.

Stern sees the emotional toll this takes on younger generations. She describes how many young people are increasingly pessimistic about the possibility of adapting to a rapidly changing climate. Their appeals are not only for their own futures, but for genuine intergenerational action that recognises shared responsibility across age groups. They are asking older generations not just to listen, but to act alongside them.

Her own motivation is rooted in concern for those who will come after her, rather than her own survival. She has been committed to environmental and climate issues since 1977, and that long history of engagement has led her to view climate litigation as a crucial tool. In her view, legal action is one of the few ways left to hold states and companies accountable for their role in the climate crisis.

This is why Swiss Senior Women for Climate Protection have taken their case to the European Court of Human Rights. Through this lawsuit, they are seeking recognition that climate protection is a human right. Such a ruling, Stern believes, would not only validate their struggle, but also offer concrete support to young people who are living with mounting existential fears about their future on a destabilising planet.
