The Antarctic is often imagined as a vast, frozen emptiness, but its ocean is alive with an extraordinary abundance of wildlife. Whales, orcas, seals, fish, seabirds and unique seafloor species all depend on this remote ecosystem. It is one of the last truly wild frontiers on Earth – and it urgently needs protection.

This wild ocean is under growing pressure. Rapid warming on the Antarctic Peninsula is changing the very foundations of life there. Sea ice is shrinking and shifting, and with it the habitat of krill – the tiny crustaceans that form the base of the entire Antarctic food web. Many species, from penguins and seals to great whales, rely on krill for survival.

At the same time, industrial fishing is putting further strain on already vulnerable krill and fish populations. As these pressures mount, the integrity of the whole ecosystem is at risk.

There is a clear way forward. The Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) has the power to create marine reserves in the Southern Ocean. In 2009, CCAMLR member countries agreed to establish a network of such protected areas. However, progress since then has been slow, and the scale of the threat has only grown.

To help change this, the Antarctic Ocean Alliance has released a new publication outlining a vision for a comprehensive network of marine reserves. The proposal identifies 19 distinct areas that together would protect more than 40% of the Southern Ocean. Safeguarding these areas would help protect critical habitats, bolster wildlife populations and preserve the resilience of this unique ecosystem.

This October, at the 2012 CCAMLR meeting, governments have a crucial opportunity. By agreeing to create this network of marine reserves, CCAMLR members can take a landmark step for ocean protection – not only for Antarctica, but as an example for safeguarding high seas areas around the world.

Public pressure can help make this happen. You can add your voice by signing the petition calling on CCAMLR members to act now and protect the Antarctic Ocean for future generations.
