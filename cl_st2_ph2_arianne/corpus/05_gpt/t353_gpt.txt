The ocean is a place of wonder and beauty, home to extraordinary life and vital to communities all over the world. Beneath the surface, though, this beauty hides growing threats: pollution, overfishing, illegal fishing, eutrophication, the climate crisis, and plastic pollution are all putting immense pressure on marine ecosystems and the people who depend on them.

For around one billion people, fish is the main source of animal protein. In Senegal, that figure reaches about 70% of the population. When fish stocks are depleted or diverted away from local markets, it is not just marine life that suffers—social stability and food security are put at risk.

In West Africa, women and small-scale fishers are on the frontlines of this struggle. They are standing up to the fishmeal and fish oil (FMFO) industry and to foreign industrial vessels that overexploit local fish stocks. These fleets and factories export fish and fish-based products to markets in Asia and Europe, while coastal communities are left facing dwindling catches, rising prices, and growing uncertainty about their future.

Women play a central role in coastal economies: they process, trade, and sell fish; they support families; they pass on knowledge and skills across generations. Yet their work is often undervalued and unrecognized. Without a clear legal status and proper protection, they are pushed to the margins of decision-making, even as they fight to keep their communities and the ocean alive.

On International Women’s Day, this struggle deserves to be seen and heard. Celebrating these women means recognizing their leadership in defending ocean health, safeguarding local livelihoods, and protecting food security for millions. It also means demanding that governments take concrete measures—starting with granting women legal status and rights that reflect the essential role they play in fisheries and coastal life.

Today is an invitation to join a global wave of appreciation. Wherever you are, take a moment to applaud the women who are resisting destructive fishing, challenging powerful interests, and working every day to keep the ocean thriving for current and future generations.
