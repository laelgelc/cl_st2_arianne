Across the world, young people are stepping into courtrooms and onto the streets to demand climate justice and a safe future. Millennials and younger generations are no longer willing to accept policies that lock them into escalating climate impacts. They are turning their frustration and fear into organized, strategic action aimed directly at the governments they believe are failing them.

One of the clearest examples of this shift comes from Colombia. There, young plaintiffs brought a case to the Supreme Court arguing that rampant deforestation in the Amazon was violating their fundamental human rights. The Court agreed, ruling that the destruction of the forest infringed on rights and recognizing the connection between environmental harm and human well‑being. This decision underscored that climate and environmental protection are not optional policy choices, but obligations tied to basic rights.

Similar legal battles are underway in North America. In the United States, young people are suing their government, arguing that current climate and energy policies are endangering their futures and undermining their constitutional protections. In Canada’s Quebec province, youth are bringing forward cases that claim government inaction on climate change violates their constitutional and equality rights, effectively treating younger generations as less deserving of safety and stability.

Courts in other countries have also started to clarify their role in the climate crisis. In the Netherlands and New Zealand, judicial decisions have affirmed that courts do have the authority to rule on climate issues. These rulings challenge the idea that climate policy is solely up to politicians and signal that governments can be held legally accountable when their actions—or inaction—put people at risk.

Legal action is only one part of this growing movement. Young people are also building powerful mobilizations in the streets and online. Movements like #FridaysForFuture have brought millions of students and supporters together in regular climate strikes, putting pressure on leaders and making climate inaction politically costly. By combining court cases with sustained public protest, youth are challenging the status quo on multiple fronts.

At the heart of these efforts is a demand for intergenerational justice: the insistence that younger and future generations deserve the same rights to safety, health and a livable planet as those who came before them. Through lawsuits, mass mobilizations and persistent organizing, young people are making it clear that climate inaction is not just bad policy—it is a violation of their rights.
