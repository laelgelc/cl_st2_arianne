Human societies today live with an extraordinary amount of environmental data. We know about rising temperatures, collapsing ecosystems, and accelerating extinction rates. Yet our collective behaviour changes slowly, if at all. This gap between knowledge and action can feel less like ignorance and more like a kind of paralysis, even an addiction to destructive habits we struggle to leave behind.

Seeing our situation through the lens of addiction helps clarify what is at stake. An addict often has access to the facts: they understand the damage being done, they may even be able to explain it clearly, but they remain locked into patterns they cannot easily interrupt. Likewise, societies can recite the key climate statistics, track deforestation in real time, and map pollution down to the molecule, while continuing to expand fossil fuel use and overconsumption. The problem is not just a lack of information; it is a deeper entanglement of habits, incentives, fears, and identities that hold the system in place.

Systems theory, as developed by thinkers like Gregory Bateson, offers one way to understand this entanglement. From a systems perspective, change happens not simply because more data is available, but because the system begins to perceive and respond to “differences that make a difference.” In other words, transformation depends on signals that are meaningful enough to disrupt existing patterns and open up new possibilities.

Facts alone rarely function as such signals. They need to be encoded in actions, symbols, and relationships that people can actually feel and respond to. This is one reason public, visible interventions—such as Greenpeace protests and other forms of non-violent direct action—matter. They are not just vehicles for information; they are coded actions that reframe reality, dramatise contradictions, and make hidden harms visible. By doing so, they can help societies register environmental breakdown not as distant statistics but as urgent, lived differences that demand a response.

At the level of individuals and communities, motivations are often contradictory. People may want clean air and a stable climate while also relying on jobs and conveniences tied to destructive industries. These conflicting drives can cancel each other out, leading to inaction even when concern is high. Memory also plays a role: past experiences of failed change, broken promises, or social backlash can make people wary of committing to new paths, reinforcing the sense that “nothing really changes.”

Biology offers useful parallels for thinking about how transformation actually happens under such constraints. In living systems, adaptation is rarely linear or purely rational. Ant colonies, for example, adjust their behaviour through countless small interactions, with individual ants responding to local cues and chemical signals. Epigenetic changes can alter how genes are expressed without changing the underlying DNA, allowing organisms to adjust to stress across generations. Cells under pressure do not simply “decide” to change; they explore different responses, some of which help them survive and reorganise.

These biological processes suggest that change is often exploratory, distributed, and context-dependent. Systems feel their way into new configurations through feedback, trial and error, and the accumulation of small shifts that eventually cross a threshold. Social transformation may work in a similar way. Rather than waiting for a single decisive breakthrough, societies evolve through many interconnected experiments—new norms, institutions, stories, and alliances—that gradually alter what is possible and acceptable.

This perspective also highlights the limits of piecemeal efforts. Isolated policies, technological fixes, or one-off campaigns can be important, but on their own they may leave the deeper system—its stories, power relations, and patterns of relationship—largely intact. A narrow focus on individual behaviour, for example, can obscure the structural forces that make destructive choices the default option. Likewise, treating climate, biodiversity, and social justice as separate issues can fragment energy and reduce the chances of meaningful change.

What is needed instead is a systemic approach that recognises the dense web of relationships in which environmental crises are embedded. This means paying attention not only to emissions and resource flows, but also to the narratives that justify them, the institutions that reinforce them, and the emotional landscapes that keep people attached to harmful patterns. Metaphors and stories are crucial here. They help people grasp complexity, see themselves within larger wholes, and imagine different futures.

Stories can reframe our role from isolated consumers to participants in living systems. They can reveal how local struggles connect to global dynamics, and how small acts of resistance or care contribute to wider shifts. By changing the stories we tell about what is normal, desirable, and inevitable, we change what our societies are capable of noticing and responding to.

For those working to catalyse ecological change, this implies a different stance. Rather than standing outside the system as detached experts, change agents are part of the very networks they hope to transform. Their effectiveness depends on the quality of their relationships—with communities, movements, institutions, and ecosystems themselves. Integrating these relationships with humility means recognising that no single organisation, discipline, or strategy has all the answers, and that genuine progress emerges from collaboration, listening, and mutual learning.

Humility also involves acknowledging uncertainty and complexity without being paralysed by them. Just as biological systems adapt through exploration, social movements and organisations must be willing to experiment, reflect, and adjust course. Protests, campaigns, and policy work can then be seen as iterative signals—coded actions that test the system, reveal its fault lines, and open space for new arrangements.

In this light, the persistence of destructive habits is not simply a moral failure or a deficit of information. It is a symptom of systems caught in self-reinforcing loops, struggling to perceive and respond to differences that could lead them elsewhere. Breaking these loops requires more than data: it calls for actions, relationships, metaphors, and stories that help societies feel their way into new patterns of life.

By embracing systemic thinking, grounding activism in rich relationships, and approaching the work with humility, it becomes possible to support the kind of deep, exploratory transformation that living systems are capable of. This is the path toward genuine ecological progress—one that honours complexity while insisting that change, however difficult, remains possible.
