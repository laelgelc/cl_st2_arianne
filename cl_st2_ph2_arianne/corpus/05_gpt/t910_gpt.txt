Fast fashion has transformed the way we buy and wear clothes, but its true cost is hidden behind low prices and rapid trend cycles. As the anniversary of the Rana Plaza factory collapse reminds us, every garment has a human story behind it. Garment workers often pay the price for our impulse buys, working long hours in unsafe conditions to keep up with relentless demand for cheap, ever-changing styles.

The environmental impact is just as stark. Producing a single pair of jeans can require around 7,000 liters of water, while chemical dyeing processes pollute rivers and waterways. The industry produces around 80 billion garments each year, and most of these eventually end up in landfills, contributing to a mounting waste crisis.

Efforts by big brands to tackle this problem through clothing donation and recycling schemes are often presented as solutions, but the reality is far more limited. For example, only about 1% of collected clothing is turned into recycled fibers. The rest is downcycled, exported, incinerated, or dumped. This model does little to address overproduction and overconsumption; instead, it can make shoppers feel better about buying more, believing their old clothes are being “recycled” into something new.

A more effective approach is to slow down our consumption and value what we already own. Around 95% of clothing that ends up being discarded could be upcycled, repaired, or otherwise kept in use. Old garments can be reworked into new pieces, swapped, or simply stored until trends cycle back—as they so often do. The constant churn of micro-trends encourages us to treat clothes as disposable, but style is cyclical, and well-made items can stay relevant for years.

The growth of fast fashion has fueled an obsession with newness. Between 1991 and 2007, the average number of new garments purchased per American rose from 34 to 67 per year. This surge in consumption is directly tied to the environmental damage and labor abuses across the fashion supply chain.

Designer Vivienne Westwood captured the necessary shift in mindset with a simple principle: “Buy less, choose well, make it last.” That means resisting impulse buys, questioning whether we really need another item, and considering the people and resources behind each piece of clothing. By buying fewer, better-quality items and extending the life of what we already own, we can reduce pressure on workers, cut down on waste, and start to break the destructive cycle of fast fashion.
