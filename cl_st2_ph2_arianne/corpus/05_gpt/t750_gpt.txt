Five years ago, the Rana Plaza factory in Bangladesh collapsed, killing 1,138 garment workers and injuring many more. They were making clothes for well-known global brands such as Mango, Primark, and Walmart. The images of the rubble, the labels found in the debris, and the stories of workers who had been forced back into a visibly unsafe building revealed to the world the true human cost of fast fashion. Rana Plaza became a symbol of an industry built on cheap labour, unsafe working conditions, and a relentless drive for ever-faster, ever-cheaper clothing.

Five years on, Rana Plaza is still a grim reminder that the fashion industry must change. It also marks the fifth year of the Fashion Revolution movement, which was born in direct response to the disaster. Each year, during Fashion Revolution Week, people around the world ask one simple but powerful question: “Who made my clothes?”

This year, from April 23–29, Fashion Revolution is taking place in 100 countries. Campaigners, workers, designers, and citizens are coming together to demand a fashion industry that is safe, sustainable, and transparent. The call is clear: no one should die for fashion, and no river, community, or ecosystem should be sacrificed so that brands can sell more clothes at rock-bottom prices.

The problems run deep. Fashion is one of the world’s most resource-hungry industries. It consumes vast amounts of water, uses hazardous chemicals in dyeing and finishing, and sheds microfibres into rivers and seas every time synthetic clothing is washed. These impacts are often hidden from view, taking place far from the shops where we buy our clothes, in communities that live with polluted waterways and toxic air.

Greenpeace’s Detox My Fashion campaign has been pushing the industry to face up to this reality. Thanks to public pressure and persistent campaigning, 15% of the global textile sector has now committed to eliminating hazardous chemicals from their supply chains. This is an important step, showing that when people demand change, brands can move. But it is also a reminder that much more needs to be done: the majority of the industry still has not made these commitments, and the environmental strain from fashion continues to grow.

Rana Plaza exposed the human cost of fast fashion. The ongoing pollution of rivers, the spread of toxic chemicals, and the invisible clouds of microfibres show its environmental cost. Both are symptoms of the same system: one that treats workers and the environment as disposable.

Everyone who wears clothes has a role to play in changing this. Individual actions will not fix the system on their own, but they send a powerful signal to brands and politicians that people are no longer willing to accept business as usual.

There are many ways to get involved:

You can start with your own wardrobe. Upcycle what you already have instead of buying new. Learn basic repairs, customise old pieces, or turn something unworn into something you love again. Organise or join a clothes swap with friends, your workplace, or your community so that clothes are shared and used for longer instead of ending up in landfill.

You can connect with others. Attend Fashion Revolution events in your area between April 23–29 to learn more about how the industry works and to meet people who are working for change. Watch the documentary “True Cost” to see how our clothes are linked to workers’ rights, environmental destruction, and global inequality. Read reports that dig into fashion’s impacts so you can speak about them with confidence.

You can use your voice. Ask brands directly about their supply chains and their environmental policies. Email or write to the companies you buy from and demand that they protect workers, eliminate hazardous chemicals, and reduce their overall impact. Contact your political representatives and urge them to support strong regulations that hold the fashion industry accountable for both social and environmental harm.

You can also join the global conversation online. During Fashion Revolution Week, turn your clothes inside out, show the label, take a photo, and share it on Instagram with the hashtag #whomademyclothes. Tag the brand and ask them to reveal where and how your clothes were made. When thousands of people do this, it becomes harder for companies to stay silent.

Five years after Rana Plaza, the memory of the workers who died must not fade. Honouring them means refusing to accept an industry that gambles with human lives and the health of our planet. It means pushing for fashion that is not just stylish and affordable, but also safe for workers, clean for rivers and oceans, and transparent from cotton field to shop floor.

The Fashion Revolution movement and campaigns like Detox My Fashion show that change is possible when people stand together. This anniversary is not just a moment to look back in sorrow; it is a call to act. By rethinking how we buy, wear, and value our clothes—and by demanding better from brands and politicians—we can help transform fashion from one of the world’s most harmful industries into one that respects both people and the planet.
