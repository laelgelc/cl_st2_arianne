Across the Global South, and especially in Africa, women are bearing the brunt of the climate crisis. They are among the first to feel the impacts on land, water, food, and livelihoods, yet too often they are shut out of the rooms where decisions about their futures are made. The climate emergency is not just about rising temperatures and extreme weather; it is also about power, justice, and whose voices are heard.

In many African communities, women are central to food systems as farmers, fishers, and food processors. When climate change disrupts rainfall patterns, degrades soils, or empties the oceans, it is their work and their families’ survival that are directly threatened. At the same time, economic systems shaped by colonial histories and global inequality deepen these vulnerabilities, concentrating benefits and decision-making power far away from the people most affected.

Women fish processors in Senegal are a powerful example of this injustice and resistance. Their livelihoods depend on healthy fish stocks close to shore. Yet industrial trawlers, often large foreign vessels, are hauling away the very fish coastal communities rely on. These women are protesting the theft of their primary source of income and food, calling out a system that prioritises profit over people and ecosystems. Their struggle is about more than fish; it is about dignity, sovereignty, and the right to sustain their communities.

Feminist and decolonial perspectives are essential to understanding and transforming these realities. Feminism here is not an abstract concept but a lived practice of challenging patriarchal norms that exclude women from leadership and decision-making. Decoloniality means confronting the legacies of colonial exploitation that still shape trade, resource extraction, and climate vulnerability. Together, they help reveal how climate injustice is intertwined with gender, race, and economic inequality.

Climate justice demands that we recognise these intersections. The same systems that drive environmental destruction often perpetuate racial discrimination, economic marginalisation, and gender-based violence. Women in Africa are not just victims of these intersecting crises; they are also organisers, knowledge keepers, and leaders pushing for change. Their traditional knowledge about land, water, and biodiversity is a cornerstone of community resilience, from sustainable farming practices to ways of managing fisheries and forests.

A truly just response to the climate crisis must include everyone, especially those who have long been sidelined. This means centring the leadership of women and ensuring that LGBTIQ people are not excluded from relief efforts, protection, and support. In times of disaster and displacement, LGBTIQ communities often face heightened discrimination and barriers to aid. Leaving them out of climate responses reinforces the very inequalities that make people vulnerable in the first place.

Across the continent, African women are leading crucial climate conversations and actions. Six such women, each in different contexts and movements, are helping to reshape how we think about solutions. They are confronting extractive industries, defending land and ocean territories, championing community rights, and insisting that climate policy reflect the realities on the ground. Their work shows that addressing the climate crisis is inseparable from fighting inequality and defending human rights.

These women’s leadership is rooted in resilience and collective care. They draw on traditional knowledge passed down through generations, while also engaging with new tools and strategies to confront a rapidly changing world. They are building alliances across borders and movements, linking climate justice with struggles for gender equality, racial justice, and economic transformation.

What they are calling for is not minor reform but a paradigm shift. It is a demand that climate solutions stop reproducing old patterns of exploitation and exclusion, and instead redistribute power, resources, and decision-making. It is a call to listen to those on the frontlines, to recognise the value of their knowledge and labour, and to ensure that climate action strengthens, rather than undermines, their rights and autonomy.

Women in the Global South, and in Africa in particular, are already doing the work of climate justice every day: defending their livelihoods, protecting ecosystems, caring for their communities, and challenging systems of oppression. Supporting their struggles and amplifying their voices is not optional; it is fundamental to any hope of a livable, just future.
