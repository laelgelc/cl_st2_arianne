A vast black plume of wastewater off the coast of Shishi, in China’s Fujian province, has revealed a disturbing link between toxic industrial pollution and the global children’s clothing industry. Investigations traced this pollution to the Wubao Dyeing Industrial zone, a major hub for textile dyeing and finishing that supplies fabrics for children’s clothes sold around the world.

Sampling of the discharges from this industrial zone uncovered hazardous chemicals, including nonylphenol, chlorinated anilines, and antimony. These substances are used in processes such as dyeing, printing, and treating textiles, and are known for their potential to harm human health. Nonylphenol, for example, is associated with hormone disruption, while chlorinated anilines and antimony are also linked to serious health concerns.

What makes this even more alarming is that residues of these same hazardous chemicals were found in exported children’s clothing produced in Shishi and in another major children’s wear centre, Zhili. This means the problem is not confined to local waterways; it is embedded in products that end up in homes and on children’s skin around the world.

Children are particularly vulnerable to hazardous chemicals that interfere with hormones and development. Even low-level exposures during critical growth stages can contribute to long‑term health risks. The presence of these chemicals in both manufacturing effluent and finished garments raises serious questions about the safety of the global children’s clothing supply chain.

The situation is compounded by regulatory gaps. In China, current laws and standards do not adequately control or restrict the use and release of many hazardous chemicals used in textile production. Along the coastline, there are numerous discharge points where industrial wastewater enters rivers and the sea, and many of these outlets are operating illegally. The black plume off Shishi is a visible symbol of a much wider and largely hidden problem.

Greenpeace is calling for strong government action to close these regulatory loopholes. This includes policies that require full disclosure of chemicals used and discharged by factories, transparency about what is released into the environment, and effective enforcement against illegal pollution. Without clear rules and accountability, hazardous substances will continue to flow into rivers, seas, and consumer products.

At the same time, global clothing brands have a critical role to play. Major companies that source from Shishi, Zhili, and similar hubs—such as Adidas and Disney—are being urged to commit to detoxing their supply chains. This means eliminating hazardous chemicals from production, ensuring transparency about suppliers and discharges, and investing in safer alternatives and cleaner production processes.

Some brands, including Zara and Mango, have already taken steps in this direction by committing to phase out hazardous chemicals from their supply chains. These commitments demonstrate that change is possible when companies accept responsibility for the environmental and health impacts of their products.

The black wastewater plume off Shishi is a stark reminder that the true cost of cheap, colourful children’s clothing can be measured in polluted seas, contaminated rivers, and potential risks to children’s health. By strengthening regulations, enforcing the law, and pushing brands to detox their supply chains, it is possible to protect both local communities in China and children who wear these clothes around the world.
