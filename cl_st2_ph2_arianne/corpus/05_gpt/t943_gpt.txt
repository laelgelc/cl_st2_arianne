High seas transshipping in the Pacific Ocean is a dangerous loophole that keeps destructive fishing practices out of sight and beyond effective control. By allowing fishing vessels to offload their catch to massive motherships and refrigerated reefers far from shore, this system lets them stay at sea for months or even years without ever entering port. That means no proper inspections, no meaningful oversight, and almost no accountability.

This hidden network at sea is a gift to those who profit from overfishing and illegal fishing. When catches are transferred between vessels in the middle of the ocean, it becomes far harder to trace where fish were caught, how much was taken, and whether rules were followed. It undermines efforts to manage tuna and other fish stocks responsibly, and it weakens the already fragile safeguards meant to keep our oceans from being emptied.

The human cost is just as alarming. The International Labour Organization has documented how workers on fishing vessels are made especially vulnerable by long periods at sea, isolation, and the absence of effective monitoring. These conditions create fertile ground for abuse. An Associated Press investigation has already exposed how fish caught with slave labor can enter global markets through these very same opaque supply chains. When vessels never have to dock, abusive operators can keep workers trapped and invisible.

International bodies have recognized how dangerous this situation is. The UN Food and Agriculture Organization has recommended prohibiting transshipping at sea altogether, acknowledging that the risks to marine ecosystems and workers are too high. In the Pacific, fisheries managers have taken some steps by requiring advance notice for transshipping and banning it for purse seine vessels, but these partial measures are not enough to close the loophole.

As long as high seas transshipping continues, it will be used to launder illegal catches, hide overfishing, and conceal labor exploitation. Ending this practice is essential to protect the Pacific Ocean, safeguard tuna stocks, and defend the rights and safety of the people who work at sea. The path forward is clear: phase out transshipping at sea and bring fishing operations back into the light, where they can be properly monitored, regulated, and held to account.
