In Madrid, at COP25, something is happening that has never happened before: climate strikers from every continent, from the global north and the global south, are coming together in one intercontinental meeting to make sure youth voices can no longer be sidelined in climate policy decisions.

For years, climate conferences have taken place without meaningful youth participation. Decisions about our future have been made in rooms where young people were either absent or reduced to symbolic roles. This time, climate strikers are determined to change that. Representatives from each continent are gathering not as observers, but as an organised, global force demanding that governments listen and act.

Throughout COP25, youth strikers are setting their own agenda and creating moments that cannot be ignored. On Wednesday, they will hold a press conference to bring their demands directly into the media spotlight. On Friday, they will take to the streets of Madrid in a major climate march, joined by Greta Thunberg, to show that the movement is not slowing down, even as political leaders delay and deflect.

These actions come after more than a year of relentless strikes and mobilisations around the world. Week after week, young people have left their classrooms and taken to the streets, calling for urgent climate action. Yet governments have largely refused to change course. Emissions keep rising, fossil fuel projects keep expanding, and the gap between what science demands and what politicians deliver keeps growing.

That refusal to act is exactly why youth are stepping up their efforts. The message from this intercontinental gathering is clear: the climate crisis demands system change, not small adjustments or distant promises. Strikers are calling for radical measures to keep global heating within 1.5°C, in line with what science and justice require. They are insisting that climate policies must confront the roots of the crisis, not just its symptoms.

At the heart of this meeting is solidarity. Climate strikers from the global north and south are standing together for climate justice, recognising that those who have contributed least to the crisis are often hit first and hardest by its impacts. By uniting across continents, they are building a shared front that refuses to let any community be sacrificed.

In Madrid, youth are no longer waiting to be invited into the conversation. They are bringing their demands directly into the halls of power and out onto the streets, determined to turn empty words into real action and to keep pushing until climate justice becomes a reality.
