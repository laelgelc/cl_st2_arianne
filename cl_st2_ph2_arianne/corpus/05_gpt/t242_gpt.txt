For more than fifty years, music has been woven into Greenpeace’s work for environmental justice, helping turn concern into collective action and transforming urgent issues into sounds people can feel as well as understand.

It began in 1970, when a benefit concert featuring Joni Mitchell and James Taylor helped fund a bold new idea: an expedition to confront nuclear testing. That show did more than raise money. It signalled that artists and activists could stand together against one of the most destructive forces on Earth, using music to amplify a message that governments and corporations preferred to ignore.

Through the 1980s, this collaboration between music and activism grew. One landmark moment came in 1989 with the Soviet album “Greenpeace: Breakthrough,” which brought together artists including U2 and Sting. At a time when the Cold War was still reshaping global politics, this project crossed borders and languages, using songs to carry a simple demand: protect the planet we share. The record showed how music could cut through ideology and censorship, reaching people where official messages could not.

In the 1990s, anti-nuclear concerts continued this tradition. They turned stages into platforms for resistance, drawing crowds not only for the artists they loved, but for a cause that demanded attention. These shows helped keep nuclear dangers in the public eye, tying the joy and energy of live performance to the urgent need to end one of the most destructive technologies ever created.

As the new century unfolded, Greenpeace’s musical collaborations evolved with the crises facing the planet. In 2016, composer Ludovico Einaudi performed a haunting piece on a floating platform in the Arctic, surrounded by ice and ocean. The stark beauty of the performance, set against a fragile landscape, brought the reality of a warming world into sharp focus. It was a reminder that the climate emergency is not an abstract concept, but a lived experience for ecosystems already on the brink.

Two years later, Thom Yorke created a track dedicated to the oceans in 2018, adding his voice to the call to protect the seas from pollution, overfishing, and climate breakdown. By linking his music to the fate of the oceans, he helped carry the story of marine destruction—and the possibility of renewal—to audiences who might never read a scientific report, but who would listen to a song.

In 2017, Greenpeace pushed this connection between sound and environment even further with the Save Our Sounds project. Nature recordings—from habitats under threat—were remixed by artists into an album called “Soundtrack to the Future.” Instead of treating the natural world as background noise, this project placed it at the centre of the music itself. The result was a powerful reminder that the voices of forests, oceans, and wildlife are part of our shared sonic heritage, and that losing them would mean silencing entire soundscapes.

Across these five decades, from coffeehouse stages and Cold War studios to Arctic platforms and digital remixes, one thread runs through it all: music can move people to act. It can cross borders, bridge generations, and carry complex truths in ways that statistics and speeches alone cannot. Every concert, album, and performance in this history has helped turn environmental concern into a global chorus for change.

As Greenpeace continues to fight for climate justice and the protection of our shared home, music remains a vital ally—reminding us not only of what we stand to lose, but of the powerful, creative, and collective force we can be when we raise our voices together.
