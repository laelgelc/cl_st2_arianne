The first thing I learned on board the Arctic Sunrise was that I didn’t actually know how to talk about a ship.

What I’d always called “walls” are bulkheads. The “ceiling” above my head is the deckhead. The floor under my feet is the deck. Even the everyday spaces have new names: the mess is the dining room, the galley is the kitchen. It felt like stepping into a parallel world with its own language, rules, and rhythms.

And then there was the wobbling.

Nothing on land prepared me for the constant, subtle movement of a ship at sea. It’s not just a sway you notice now and then; it’s a background presence that shapes everything. Walking down a corridor means automatically reaching for a handhold on the bulkhead. Carrying a cup of tea from the galley to the mess becomes a small balancing act. Even sleeping is different—you’re rocked, shifted, nudged by the sea all night long.

Life in the mess and galley revolves around this motion. Plates are stacked carefully so they don’t slide. Pots in the galley are secured so they don’t shift on the stove. People sit with feet braced, instinctively leaning into the movement of the ship. It’s amazing how quickly the body starts to anticipate the next roll or pitch, how fast you adapt to a world that is never quite still.

We were sailing in the Sylt Outer Reef, a marine sanctuary off Germany’s coast. The word “sanctuary” sounds peaceful and protected, and from the deck, the sea can look exactly that way—wide, grey-blue, and calm, hiding its troubles under the surface.

But below us, the reality is very different.

On board, campaigner Thilo Maack explained what is really happening in this so-called protected area. Dumping and drilling are banned here. On paper, that sounds like a serious step to curb the exploitation of the ocean. Yet industrial bottom trawling is still allowed.

Bottom trawling means dragging heavy nets and gear across the seabed. In a place like the Sylt Outer Reef, this doesn’t just skim the surface—it gouges the seafloor, tearing through the habitats that so many species depend on. The nets aren’t selective. They’re designed to catch brown shrimp, but they take almost everything in their path.

Thilo described how up to 80% of what’s caught in these trawls is bycatch—unintended catch that gets thrown back, often dead. That includes endangered harbor porpoises, animals that should be safe in a sanctuary but instead end up caught in nets, only to be discarded. And it’s not just a few unlucky individuals: a third of the species in this protected area are at risk.

Standing on deck, feeling the ship wobble beneath my feet, those numbers landed with a kind of heaviness I hadn’t expected. Above the waterline, the Arctic Sunrise was full of small, human-scale challenges: learning the ship’s language, keeping your balance in the mess, figuring out how to move with the sea instead of fighting it. Below the waterline, the challenges are far bigger, and the stakes are life and death for entire species.

From the outside, a marine sanctuary sounds like a promise. Being on the Arctic Sunrise in the Sylt Outer Reef made it clear how fragile that promise is when destructive fishing like bottom trawling is still allowed to tear through the seabed, sweep up brown shrimp along with masses of unwanted life, and leave endangered harbor porpoises and so many other species at risk in a place that’s supposed to protect them.
