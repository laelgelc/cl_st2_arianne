The Arctic is warming faster than almost anywhere else on Earth, and the ice that once shielded its fragile ecosystems is disappearing. As the ice melts, it is opening the door for industrial fishing fleets and oil companies to push further into this vulnerable region. Instead of treating the Arctic as a sanctuary that needs protection, some see it as a new frontier to exploit.

One of the places under threat is Svalbard, a remote archipelago in the Arctic Ocean under Norwegian jurisdiction. As sea ice retreats, fishing vessels are moving north and targeting areas that were once inaccessible. Among the most destructive are bottom trawlers, which drag heavy nets across the seabed. This method can devastate slow-growing seabed species like sea pens and corals, tearing up habitats that have taken decades or even centuries to form. In the process, we risk wiping out species that science has not even had the chance to discover.

The damage does not stop at the seafloor. Industrial fishing in Svalbard’s waters also threatens marine life higher up the food chain. Bycatch – the unintentional capture of non-target species – is a serious concern. Near-threatened Greenland sharks, which can live for centuries, can be caught and killed in fishing gear meant for other species. Losing such long-lived animals to bycatch is not just a tragedy for individual animals; it undermines the survival of entire populations.

Fishing fleets also leave behind a trail of pollution. Discarded plastic gear, such as nets and ropes, drifts through the Arctic seas and can end up entangling wildlife. Polar bears, already struggling with the loss of sea ice they rely on for hunting, can become caught in this plastic waste. Entanglement can cause injuries, restrict movement, and even lead to death.

Underwater noise from industrial activity is another growing threat. The engines, sonar, and machinery of ships and fishing vessels create a constant din that cuts through the water. For narwhals and beluga whales, which depend on sound to communicate, navigate, and find mates, this noise can be deeply disruptive. Interference with their communication and breeding can have lasting impacts on their populations.

The effects ripple outward through the entire ecosystem. Walruses, for example, are already under pressure as sea ice disappears, forcing them to haul out on land in large, crowded groups. Industrial fishing can reduce the availability of their food, adding yet another strain to a species already struggling to adapt to rapid environmental change. In the Arctic, everything is connected: damage to the seabed, disruption of whales, harm to polar bears, and stress on walruses are all part of the same unfolding crisis.

Norway has a responsibility and an opportunity to act. The Norwegian government can choose to protect Svalbard’s unique and vulnerable ecosystem from destructive fishing practices, including bottom trawling, and to limit the industrial pressures that are now moving into the region as the ice retreats. Doing so would help safeguard seabed habitats, reduce bycatch of species like the Greenland shark, cut the risk of plastic entanglement for polar bears, and lessen the acoustic assault on narwhals and belugas.

This is a critical moment. As climate change strips away the Arctic’s natural defenses, decisions made now will shape the future of Svalbard and the wider Arctic for generations. Telling the Norwegian government to protect Svalbard from destructive fishing is not just about one place on the map; it is about defending an interconnected web of life that is already under extraordinary pressure.
