Behind the seafood on our plates lies a reality that is too often hidden from view. Across the global seafood industry, serious human rights abuses, environmental destruction, and climate impacts are deeply intertwined.

In many industrial fishing operations, especially those far from shore, migrant workers from Southeast Asia are among the most vulnerable. They can face exploitation, physical and verbal abuse, and inhumane living and working conditions. Long periods at sea, cramped quarters, lack of medical care, and dangerous work are common features of this system. Transshipment at sea – where catch is transferred from one vessel to another without returning to port – can trap workers in isolation for months or even years, cutting them off from oversight, legal recourse, or even contact with their families. This isolation makes it easier for abuses to remain unseen and unreported.

At the same time, the oceans that sustain these fisheries are under mounting pressure from climate change. Rising temperatures and ocean acidification threaten marine ecosystems, undermining the health of fish populations and the communities that depend on them. Yet healthy oceans and marine life are also powerful allies against climate change. Marine ecosystems can absorb and store significant amounts of carbon, helping to buffer the planet from even more severe climate disruption. Protecting ocean health is therefore critical not only for biodiversity and food security, but also for stabilising the climate.

Overfishing is eroding that resilience. Decades of intense fishing pressure have pushed many fish populations to the brink. Illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing is a major driver of this crisis, with an estimated value of up to $23.5 billion every year. These shadowy operations often target vulnerable stocks, ignore catch limits, and operate with little to no regard for labour rights or environmental rules. The result is a double blow: depleted fish populations and ongoing human rights risks.

The methods used in industrial fishing can be highly destructive. Bottom trawling drags heavy nets across the seabed, damaging fragile habitats and killing a wide range of marine life, not just the target species. Longlining sets out vast lines of baited hooks that can entangle or kill non-target species, including seabirds, turtles, and sharks. Purse seining with fish aggregating devices (FADs) concentrates fish in one place, making them easier to catch in huge quantities, but also increasing bycatch and putting additional pressure on already stressed populations. These practices undermine marine biodiversity and the long-term sustainability of fisheries.

For coastal communities, the consequences are profound. Many people rely on the sea for food, income, and cultural identity. As fish stocks decline and destructive fishing practices spread, small-scale fishers often find themselves competing with industrial fleets for dwindling resources. Livelihoods become more precarious, local economies suffer, and traditional ways of life are put at risk.

Consumers and citizens have an important role to play in changing this system. Choosing seafood from sustainable sources helps support fisheries that respect ecological limits and reduce harm to marine ecosystems. But individual choices alone are not enough. Public pressure on governments is essential to secure strong, enforceable rules for ethical and sustainable fisheries management. That includes cracking down on IUU fishing, ending destructive fishing methods, and protecting the rights and safety of workers at sea.

By demanding transparency, accountability, and sustainability from the seafood industry and from those who regulate it, we can help protect both people and the oceans we all depend on.
