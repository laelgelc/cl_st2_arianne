When the famous red and white ‘Iamsterdam’ letters were removed from the Dutch capital in 2018, the empty space they left behind became a global talking point. Tourists and locals who had grown used to the sign as a symbol of place and identity suddenly found themselves facing a gap – a missing landmark that had seemed permanent.

That sense of loss and shock is a powerful way to understand what is happening thousands of kilometres away in the Amazon rainforest. If we imagine those letters instead spelling ‘Iamazonia’, the empty space becomes a stark metaphor for the accelerating disappearance of the forest itself – a living landmark of planetary importance.

For generations, Indigenous Peoples have protected the Amazon, shaping and caring for it while depending on its rivers, soils and biodiversity for their survival and culture. Their knowledge, stewardship and resistance have helped keep vast areas of the forest standing. Yet today, they face intensifying pressure and danger.

Under President Bolsonaro’s government in Brazil, industrial exploitation of the Amazon through agriculture, mining and logging has been aggressively promoted. This political agenda has opened the door to more invasions of Indigenous territories and forest areas, and with them, a rise in violence against communities who are defending their homes and the forest. The consequences extend far beyond national borders: as more forest is destroyed, global climate stability is put at even greater risk.

Just as people around the world reacted when a beloved city landmark vanished, the disappearance of the Amazon demands an even stronger, sustained response. The forest is not only a symbol; it is a vital, irreplaceable system that helps regulate the climate for everyone.

Standing with Indigenous Peoples and supporting their struggles to protect their lands and rights is central to safeguarding the Amazon. This is a call for people everywhere to recognise the Amazon as a shared, planetary landmark – and to act together so that ‘Iamazonia’ does not become an empty space in our collective future.
