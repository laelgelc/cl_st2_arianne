In just three years, President Jair Bolsonaro’s anti-environmental agenda has pushed Brazil backwards on climate, human rights, and environmental protection.

Under his government, deforestation in the Amazon has risen by 52.9%. This destruction of the world’s largest rainforest is directly linked to a surge in fires and land grabbing, while environmental oversight has been systematically dismantled. The devastation has not been limited to the Amazon: fires have ravaged the Cerrado and the Pantanal, with the Pantanal alone losing a third of its area in 2020. These biomes are critical for biodiversity, water cycles, and climate stability, and their loss has global consequences.

Brazil’s greenhouse gas emissions have increased by 10% during this period, making the country the world’s fifth-largest emitter. Instead of reducing emissions and protecting forests, the government has emboldened destructive activities that accelerate the climate crisis.

This deterioration is no accident. Environmental agencies that once played a key role in enforcing Brazilian law and protecting nature have been deliberately weakened. IBAMA and ICMBio have suffered severe budget cuts of 30% and 32.7%, respectively, while staff numbers have been reduced by 10%. With fewer resources and fewer people on the ground, illegal deforestation, land invasions, and environmental crimes have flourished.

The consequences for Indigenous peoples and environmental defenders have been brutal. Violence has escalated, with 20 killings of Indigenous people and activists recorded in 2021 and 1,576 land conflicts in 2020. These numbers reflect a climate of impunity, where those who defend forests, rivers, and traditional territories face intimidation, attacks, and death.

At the same time, the government has opened the floodgates to toxic agriculture. More than 1,500 new pesticides have been approved, many of them banned in the European Union. This expansion of hazardous chemicals threatens the health of rural communities, farm workers, and ecosystems, while deepening a model of agribusiness that depends on deforestation and pollution.

Bolsonaro has also targeted civil society organizations, attacking NGOs that denounce environmental destruction and defend human rights. His administration’s hostility toward independent voices has gone hand in hand with its disastrous handling of the COVID-19 pandemic and the economy, compounding social and environmental crises.

These three years have made clear that Bolsonaro’s project is one of dismantling protections, silencing defenders, and sacrificing forests, Indigenous territories, and public health for short-term interests. Allowing this agenda to continue would mean more deforestation, more fires, more violence, and higher emissions at a moment when the world urgently needs the opposite.

Preventing Bolsonaro’s reelection is essential to halt this destructive trajectory and open the possibility of rebuilding environmental governance, protecting Indigenous rights, and putting Brazil back on a path that safeguards people, nature, and the climate.
