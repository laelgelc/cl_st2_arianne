Greenpeace Korea has consistently called on Hyundai Motor Company to stop producing internal combustion engine vehicles and shift entirely to electric vehicles as a critical step to tackle the climate crisis. Hyundai has responded with new targets: increasing the share of electric vehicles and fuel cell electric vehicles to 25.8% of total sales by 2030 and 78% by 2040. The company also aims to sell 100% electric vehicles in Europe, China, and the United States by 2040. However, Hyundai has not committed to ending internal combustion engine vehicle sales globally.

This limited scope is not aligned with what is needed to confront the climate emergency. To be on track for net-zero emissions by 2050, Hyundai must fully transition to electric vehicles worldwide by 2035. Anything less leaves a substantial share of its global sales locked into fossil fuel–based technologies for too long.

A faster and more ambitious transition would bring multiple benefits. Electric vehicles can offer lower running and maintenance costs compared to internal combustion engine cars. They also help improve air quality by avoiding tailpipe emissions that harm public health, especially in cities. In addition, a decisive move to electric mobility can drive the creation of new jobs in clean technology manufacturing, charging infrastructure, and related services.

Other markets are already moving quicker than Hyundai’s current global plan. Countries and regions such as Norway and the United Kingdom, and states like California, have announced earlier phase-out dates for internal combustion engine vehicles. These examples show that faster transitions are not only possible but are already underway.

Greenpeace Korea is therefore urging Hyundai Motor Company to go beyond its current regional commitments and adopt a global target of 100% electric vehicle sales by 2035 as part of a credible pathway to net-zero by 2050.
