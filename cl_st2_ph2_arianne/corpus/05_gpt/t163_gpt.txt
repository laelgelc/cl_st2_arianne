The photos sit in a box, edges curled, colours softened by time. Each one is a doorway back into the years when a handful of people in small boats tried to change the course of history—years when Greenpeace was still learning what it could become.

In 1975, one of those photos captured a moment that would echo across four decades: returning a Sisiutl flag to the Yalis Kwakwa̱ka̱ʼwakw community. That flag, bearing the powerful double-headed sea serpent, had sailed with us as a symbol of protection and strength. Bringing it back was far more than a formality. It was an act of respect, a recognition that our campaigns moved through Indigenous territories and waters, and that our work was bound up with their histories and rights.

Handing the Sisiutl flag back to the community in Yalis felt like closing a circle and opening another. The memory of that day stayed with me through countless voyages and confrontations. Then, in 2015, another photograph marked the continuation of that story: receiving a new Sisiutl flag from the same community. Four decades had passed, but the gesture carried the same weight. It was a quiet affirmation that relationships built on trust and solidarity can endure, even as campaigns, ships, and activists come and go.

The mid-1970s were a time when the organization was still small, but the scale of our ambitions was growing as fast as the seas we crossed. The 1975 whale campaign stands out in my memory as a turning point. Those images of inflatables and crew members placing themselves between harpoons and whales helped carry Greenpeace’s message far beyond the Pacific coast. That campaign did more than raise awareness; it helped drive the international growth of the organization itself.

With more attention came more possibilities—and more responsibility. One direct result was the acquisition of a faster ship, the James Bay. For those of us at sea, speed was not a luxury; it was the difference between witnessing a slaughter from afar and getting close enough to intervene. The James Bay meant we could reach whaling fleets more quickly, stay with them longer, and document what was happening with a clarity that earlier voyages had struggled to achieve. Each new roll of film from those journeys seemed to travel further than the last, carried by newspapers, magazines, and television screens into homes around the world.

The path to sea was never smooth. In 1976, we prepared for another major campaign, only to be brought up short not by storms or mechanical failure, but by bureaucracy. The launch was delayed by customs, and what should have been a straightforward departure stretched into a frustrating wait. For photographers and crew alike, the days blurred together in a strange limbo: gear packed, routes planned, adrenaline ready—but no clearance to sail.

Those photos from the dockside show a mix of tension and determination. We knew that every lost day at sea was a day when whaling or other destruction continued unchecked. Yet that delay also underscored something important: standing up to powerful industries and governments would always mean confronting not just harpoons and guns, but paperwork, regulations, and systems designed to slow or stop dissent. The campaign eventually did launch, and when it did, we carried with us not only our banners and cameras, but a renewed understanding of the obstacles ahead.

By 1979, the lens of our work had widened. One series of images from that year takes me back to the remote, rugged beauty of Spatsizi Park. There, the confrontation was not with whaling fleets, but with trophy hunters. The stakes, however, felt just as high. We had gone into Spatsizi allied with First Nations who opposed the killing of wildlife for sport in their territories. The alliance on that campaign was grounded in shared concern for the land and the animals who lived there.

The photographs from Spatsizi show more than conflict; they capture a sense of common purpose. Standing alongside First Nations partners, we challenged the idea that the wilderness existed as a playground for a few, rather than as a living homeland and ecosystem deserving protection. Those days in the park reinforced a lesson we had already begun to learn at sea: real change depends on solidarity with the people whose lands and waters are most directly affected.

Not all of the memories are of confrontation. Some are of quieter, more mysterious moments that felt, at the time, like signs pointing us forward. In 1975, we stopped at the Tasu mine, an industrial scar set against the wildness of the coast. It was not the kind of place you might expect to find hope, yet that stop is etched in my mind as a time of auspicious encounters.

There, amid the machinery and dust, we crossed paths with people and stories that seemed to arrive exactly when we needed them. Conversations on the dock, chance meetings, and unexpected hospitality hinted at a wider network of concern for the environment than we had fully understood. It felt as though the campaign was being quietly guided, as if the right people appeared at the right time to help us continue. The photos from Tasu show a juxtaposition of heavy industry and fragile human connection, and they still carry that strange sense of promise.

Other memories are bound not to people or politics, but to the raw power of the ocean itself. One such memory is of navigating the Yucluta Rapids, a place where the sea gathers its strength into churning, unpredictable currents. For a photographer on deck, moments like that were both terrifying and exhilarating. The camera could barely capture the motion—the way the water twisted under the hull, the strain in the faces of the crew, the intense concentration at the helm.

Passing through the Yucluta Rapids demanded trust: in the ship, in the skipper, and in one another. It was a reminder that no matter how urgent our mission, we remained small in the face of the forces we were trying to protect. Those waters taught us humility. They also knit the crew together in a way that only shared risk can.

Looking back now, the years from 1974 to 1982 feel like a continuous voyage, even though they were made up of many separate campaigns, ships, and crews. The photographs from that time are not just records of events; they are fragments of relationships and turning points.

Returning the Sisiutl flag to the Yalis Kwakwa̱ka̱ʼwakw community in 1975, and receiving a new one in 2015, bookends a long story of respect and connection. The whale campaign of 1975, and the faster James Bay that followed, marked Greenpeace’s emergence onto the international stage. The delayed launch of 1976 showed how resistance can be slowed but not stopped. The confrontation over trophy hunting in Spatsizi Park in 1979, carried out in alliance with First Nations, expanded our understanding of what environmental justice could mean on land as well as at sea. The stop at the Tasu mine, with its unexpected, auspicious encounters, hinted at unseen currents of support. And the passage through Yucluta Rapids reminded us that the ocean itself was both our route and our teacher.

Each image from those campaigns holds a piece of that history. Together, they tell the story of how a small group of people, guided by courage, collaboration, and respect, helped shape the Greenpeace that would grow in the decades to come.
