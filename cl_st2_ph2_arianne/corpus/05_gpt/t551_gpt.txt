For decades, the car industry has been selling us a dangerous illusion: that bigger, heavier vehicles are a sign of progress, comfort and safety. In reality, this trend toward ever-larger cars – especially SUVs – is driving up energy consumption and emissions, worsening road safety, and pushing us further away from the goals of the Paris Agreement.

One of the clearest examples of this problem is how the weight of popular models has ballooned over time. Take the VW Golf. Over the decades, this once-compact car has become significantly heavier. That extra weight doesn’t come for free: it leads to 57% more emissions compared to its earlier versions. The story is similar with the VW Tiguan, which is even heavier and therefore consumes more energy and emits more CO2.

This pattern repeats across the industry. Heavier vehicles need more energy to move, whether they’re powered by fossil fuels or electricity. Even electric SUVs, often marketed as “green” options, require much larger batteries to carry their bulk. Producing and powering these larger batteries consumes more resources and energy, which means higher overall climate impacts than smaller electric cars.

The problems don’t stop with emissions. SUVs and other large vehicles pose greater risks in accidents, especially for pedestrians and people in smaller cars. Their height and mass mean that collisions are more likely to be severe. On top of that, drivers of SUVs are more prone to risky behavior on the road, further increasing the danger to everyone around them.

Despite all this, car companies are doubling down on the SUV boom. They are pouring money into advertising and production of these oversized vehicles because they are highly profitable. Instead of aligning their business models with the Paris Agreement and a livable climate, they are betting on bigger, heavier cars that lock in higher emissions and greater resource use for years to come.

This is not the mobility transformation we need. A real path toward climate-safe transport looks very different: smaller electric cars instead of oversized models, more shared ownership instead of every household owning multiple vehicles, and a massive expansion of public transport so that fewer cars are needed overall. The goal must be clear: fewer vehicles on the road, not just different ones.

To push back against this destructive trend, Greenpeace has taken direct action, including a protest against SUV imports. This kind of resistance is essential to challenge an industry that continues to put profits before people and the planet. As long as carmakers keep promoting heavier, more dangerous, more energy-hungry vehicles, they are part of the climate problem, not the solution.
