The 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games in Japan were promoted as a celebration of recovery and resilience after the 2011 earthquake, tsunami, and subsequent Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster. In 2013, when Tokyo bid for the Games, then–Prime Minister Shinzo Abe assured the International Olympic Committee (IOC) that the situation at Fukushima was “under control.” Yet, years later, the ongoing nuclear crisis continues to raise serious questions about safety, transparency, and human rights.

A central challenge remains the management of more than one million tonnes of contaminated water stored at the Fukushima Daiichi site. This water, along with approximately 880 tonnes of molten nuclear fuel still inside the damaged reactors, represents a long-term environmental and technical crisis. The scale and complexity of dealing with this radioactive legacy underline how far the situation is from being resolved.

Beyond the plant itself, environmental contamination persists in surrounding areas. Radiation has affected land and ecosystems, and the impacts on workers and citizens—both those who responded to the disaster and those who continue to live in affected regions—are ongoing. Human rights concerns arise around the protection of workers, the right to health and information, and the conditions under which people have been encouraged or expected to return to or remain in contaminated areas.

An HBO documentary has brought renewed international attention to these issues, questioning the decision to host the Olympics while such a disaster is still unfolding. It raises concerns about whether the Japanese government has been fully transparent about the risks, and whether assurances about safety adequately reflect the realities on the ground in Fukushima.

Greenpeace welcomes and supports the core values that the Olympic and Paralympic movements stand for: peace, international cooperation, and respect for human dignity. Precisely because these values matter, it is vital that the IOC ensures that the Games do not come at the expense of environmental sustainability, public safety, or human rights. This includes taking seriously any evidence of ongoing contamination and ensuring that decisions about venues and routes are based on independent and robust assessments of risk.

In Fukushima prefecture, areas selected for Olympic-related events and parts of the torch relay route have been found to contain radiation hotspots. These findings stand in stark contrast to narratives that the nuclear crisis has been fully resolved. They highlight the need for continued monitoring, remediation, and transparent communication with athletes, spectators, and local communities.

Greenpeace is conducting further radiation surveys in Fukushima, including in locations linked to the Olympic and Paralympic events. The results of these surveys will be released soon. By sharing this information, Greenpeace aims to support informed public debate, uphold the rights of those most affected by the disaster, and encourage the IOC and Japanese authorities to align their actions with the environmental and human values that the Games are meant to embody.
