Across the vast northern territories of Russia, a dangerous and largely invisible threat is growing beneath the snow. Underground peat fires, often called “zombie fires,” are smouldering on through the winter months, setting the stage for an alarming 2022 fire season.

These fires are not like typical wildfires that flare up and die down with the weather. Peat fires burn deep underground in layers of ancient, carbon-rich organic matter. They can persist under snow and ice, re-emerging when conditions warm and dry. In 2021, fires in northern Russia reached unprecedented levels: an estimated 18.8 million hectares burned, and smoke from those fires travelled as far as the North Pole. Even now, smouldering peat in the Urals is sending smoke into Yekaterinburg, underscoring how long-lasting and disruptive these fires can be.

The climate implications are severe. As peat burns, it releases large amounts of greenhouse gases stored over thousands of years. This is why these underground fires are being described as a “climate bomb”: they not only devastate local ecosystems and air quality, but also accelerate global heating by unlocking vast stores of carbon that would otherwise remain safely in the ground.

Confronting this threat requires specialised knowledge and experience. Greenpeace Russia has developed significant expertise in dealing with peat fires and has stepped in to help tackle the problem. The organisation has offered its support to the regional government, and that offer has been accepted. Together, they are working on measures to prevent new outbreaks and to locate and extinguish existing underground fires before they can flare up into larger disasters.

As the 2022 fire season approaches, the work underway in northern Russia is critical. Identifying and suppressing these “zombie fires” can help reduce the risk of another devastating fire year, protect communities such as those already affected by smoke in Yekaterinburg, and prevent yet more greenhouse gases from being released into the atmosphere.
