Forests are at the heart of life on Earth. They help regulate our climate, shelter an incredible diversity of species, and provide vital resources that people depend on every day. On International Day of Forests, Greenpeace is highlighting just how essential forests are – and how urgent it is to protect them.

Forests absorb and store nearly 300 billion tonnes of carbon. This makes them one of our strongest natural allies against the climate crisis. When forests are destroyed, that stored carbon is released into the atmosphere, driving global warming. Deforestation already accounts for 12% of global greenhouse gas emissions, undermining efforts to keep temperature rise within safe limits.

The destruction of forests is also a major driver of extinction. Extinction rates in recent centuries have surged up to a thousand times higher than natural background levels. Without decisive action, these rates could rise even further. Forests are home to countless species, many of which are found nowhere else. Losing forests means losing entire ecosystems and the delicate balance they support.

Tropical rainforests, in particular, are a treasure trove of medical potential. They host 70% of plants with known anti-cancer properties and provide about a quarter of conventional medicine drugs. Every tree cut down in these forests could mean the loss of future medicines and treatments that people around the world might one day rely on.

Protecting forests is not just a moral responsibility; it is a practical necessity. Corporations like Procter & Gamble must address forest destruction in their supply chains and ensure that the products they sell are not driving deforestation. Governments also have a crucial role to play by enforcing strong protections and closing loopholes that allow forest destruction to continue.

People everywhere are speaking up. Over 10,000 people are using the hashtag #StandForForests to call for action and show that they care about the future of the world’s forests. This growing movement is a reminder that defending forests is a shared responsibility – and that collective pressure can help drive the change needed to keep forests standing for generations to come.
