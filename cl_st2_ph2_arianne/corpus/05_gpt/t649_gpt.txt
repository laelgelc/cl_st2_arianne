A year ago, Greenpeace set out to confront one of the biggest drivers of rainforest destruction: palm oil linked to forest clearing and human rights abuses. Over the past twelve months, that campaign has focused on Wilmar International, the world’s largest palm oil trader, and the global brands buying from it.

Using evidence that Wilmar was still sourcing from rainforest destroyers, Greenpeace exposed how this dirty palm oil was ending up in products made by major household names. Supporters and activists around the world then turned that evidence into pressure.

In cities across the globe, volunteers painted murals in 20 locations, bringing the story of disappearing rainforests to streets and neighbourhoods. At the sharp end of Wilmar’s supply chain, activists occupied one of the company’s refineries and intercepted its tankers on two separate occasions, disrupting business-as-usual to demand change.

The campaign also targeted the brands driving demand for Wilmar’s palm oil. Mondelez, one of the world’s biggest snack companies, was confronted over its ongoing ties to suppliers destroying forests. From Italy and Germany to the UK and the USA, activists and supporters organised protests and blockades at Mondelez sites, calling on the company to cut off destructive palm oil and clean up its supply chain.

More than 1.3 million people joined this effort, adding their names, voices and actions to the call for an end to forest destruction for palm oil. That wave of public pressure forced a response. Wilmar has now published a plan to map its suppliers and to stop buying from companies that continue to destroy rainforests.

This is an important step, but it is not the end. With fewer than 400 days left until the 2020 deadlines that many companies set for ending deforestation in their supply chains, words and plans are not enough. Implementation is what matters now.

Greenpeace will keep monitoring Wilmar’s actions to ensure its commitments are translated into real change on the ground. The goal is clear: to help bring an end to deforestation driven by palm oil, and to protect the world’s remaining rainforests for people, wildlife and the climate.
