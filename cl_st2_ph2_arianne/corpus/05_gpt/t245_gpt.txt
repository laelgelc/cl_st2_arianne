Fossil fuel companies are under increasing pressure from people and policymakers across the world who are demanding an end to the industry’s grip on our politics, our public spaces, and our future.

In the United States, Greenpeace USA is calling on Senators to finally end fossil fuel subsidies and support strong climate provisions in the Build Back Better Act. These subsidies keep the fossil fuel industry on artificial life support, even as communities bear the brunt of climate impacts and pollution. Backing robust climate measures in the legislation is a crucial step toward shifting public money away from fossil fuels and toward a just, renewable energy future.

Across the Atlantic, more than 75,000 people have joined a growing movement to get fossil fuel advertising and sponsorships banned in the European Union. This public demand reflects a clear understanding that fossil fuel companies use their brands, sponsorships, and glossy ads to maintain social license and distract from their role in driving the climate crisis. Removing fossil fuel propaganda from our public spaces is part of breaking the industry’s influence and preventing further greenwashing.

At COP26 in Glasgow, world leaders are being called on to send a clear signal that the fossil fuel era is coming to an end. One concrete sign of this shift is that oil giants such as BP and Shell are facing limited access to the talks unless they have credible emissions plans. This reflects growing recognition that those most responsible for the climate crisis cannot continue with business as usual while claiming a seat at the decision-making table without meaningful commitments to change.

Meanwhile, in the United States, scrutiny of the fossil fuel industry’s tactics is intensifying. At a Congressional hearing, executives from ExxonMobil, BP, Chevron, Shell, and representatives from key lobbying groups were pressed on their role in delaying climate action. They refused to commit to ending their opposition to emissions reductions, even as they continue to engage in greenwashing and disinformation campaigns that mislead the public and policymakers about their climate records and plans.

In response to these evasions, the chair of the committee announced subpoenas for documents related to these companies’ and groups’ climate-related communications and activities. This step underscores the seriousness of the investigation into how the fossil fuel industry has obstructed climate action and manipulated public debate.

From the halls of the U.S. Senate to the streets and public squares of Europe, and from the UN climate talks in Glasgow to the floor of Congress, the message is converging: fossil fuel companies must be held accountable, their political power must be curbed, and public policy must prioritize climate action over corporate profit.
