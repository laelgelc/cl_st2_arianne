Fifteen years after Bob Hunter’s passing on May 2, 2005, his life and work continue to reverberate far beyond the early voyages and headline-grabbing protests that helped define Greenpeace. Remembering him now means looking not only at his role as a co-founder, but at the broader arc of his life: as a writer, a journalist, a thinker shaped by ecology and peace movements, and a media strategist inspired by Marshall McLuhan.

Before he ever set foot on a protest boat, Hunter was a writer. His early work in journalism honed his ability to tell stories that mattered and to communicate complex ideas in ways people could feel. This grounding in words, images, and public conversation became the backbone of how he approached activism. He absorbed ideas from ecology and the peace movement, and he paid close attention to media theorists like McLuhan, who argued that the medium itself shapes how messages are understood. Hunter saw that if you wanted to change the world, you had to change how people see it.

From this insight emerged one of his most influential concepts: the “mind bomb.” For Hunter, non-violent revolution required more than protests and position papers; it needed powerful, unforgettable images that could detonate in the public consciousness. A “mind bomb” was a moment so striking that it cut through apathy and denial, forcing people to confront the ecological crisis. This philosophy guided some of Greenpeace’s most iconic early campaigns, where the goal was not only to be physically present at the frontlines of environmental destruction, but to bring those frontlines into living rooms around the world.

Hunter’s commitment to non-violence and to these mind bombs was central to the early Greenpeace protests against nuclear testing. By placing themselves in harm’s way between weapons and the natural world, activists created images that challenged the logic of nuclear escalation and highlighted its ecological and human costs. The same approach shaped the campaigns to save whales, where small boats and unarmed activists faced down massive whaling ships. These scenes were not accidents; they were deliberate acts of moral theatre designed to expose cruelty and awaken ecological conscience.

Beneath the strategy and spectacle, Hunter’s worldview was deeply spiritual. He saw nature as an interconnected whole, a web in which humans were just one strand among many. This sense of interconnectedness was not abstract philosophy for him, but a lived reality that influenced his politics, his writing, and his approach to activism. He treated ecology as a subversive science—one that undermined the dominant assumptions of endless growth and human separation from the rest of life on Earth. By insisting that everything was connected, ecology challenged power structures that depended on exploitation and denial.

Hunter did not present himself as a flawless hero. He was open about his personal struggles, the toll that activism took, and the difficulties of sustaining a revolutionary spirit over time. In 1977, he retired from Greenpeace, stepping back from the organisation he had helped to shape. Yet his departure did not mark an end to his engagement with the world. He continued to write books, reflect on the meaning of ecological struggle, and refine his ideas about how to change hearts and minds.

Recognition followed him beyond his formal activist years. Awards acknowledged the impact of his work as a writer, a strategist, and a pioneer of environmental campaigning. But for many, his most enduring legacy lies less in honours and more in the tools he left behind: the insistence on non-violence, the power of images, the framing of ecology as a radical lens on society, and the reminder that spiritual and emotional transformation are inseparable from political change.

Marking fifteen years since Bob Hunter’s death is not only an act of remembrance; it is a chance to reconnect with the roots of a movement that still relies on many of his core ideas. In an age saturated with media, his notion of the mind bomb remains strikingly relevant. In a world facing accelerating ecological breakdown, his belief in the interconnectedness of all life and in ecology as a subversive force continues to challenge complacency.

Hunter’s life stretched beyond any single organisation. It bridged journalism and activism, theory and practice, inner struggle and public action. His story reminds us that revolutions—especially non-violent ones—are built from words, images, and ideas as much as from marches and blockades. Fifteen years on, his legacy lives in every effort to create images that awaken, words that connect, and movements that honour the living world as a single, interdependent whole.
