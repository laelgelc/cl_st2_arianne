Vanessa Nakate, a Fridays for Future leader in Kampala, Uganda, is raising an urgent alarm about how the climate crisis is deepening existing inequalities and putting African women at particular risk. Her perspective is rooted in what she sees and hears in communities where climate disasters are no longer distant threats, but daily realities shaping women’s bodies, work, and futures.

As floods sweep through villages and farmlands, they destroy crops that women have spent months tending. These crops are not simply a source of income; they are often the main guarantee that families will eat. When fields are washed away, women must start again from nothing, replanting and rebuilding food supplies for their households. With local resources wiped out, they are forced to walk long distances in search of food and other essentials, turning survival into a physically exhausting and time-consuming struggle.

Drought brings a different but equally severe burden. When water sources dry up, women and girls, who are typically responsible for collecting water, must travel farther and carry heavier loads just to meet basic needs. This work can cause serious back pain and long-term health problems, yet it remains invisible and unpaid. It is another way the climate crisis is adding weight—literally and figuratively—to women’s daily lives.

The impacts go beyond physical strain. Climate disasters often leave families homeless, uprooted from their land and communities. Women, who are usually the primary caregivers, must protect and comfort children while coping with their own trauma. In these unstable conditions, the risk of physical and sexual violence increases. Overcrowded shelters, unsafe routes to collect water or firewood, and the breakdown of social support systems all create environments where women and girls are more vulnerable.

When subsistence farms fail and families lose their main source of food and income, the consequences can be devastating for girls’ futures. Some families, pushed to the edge by repeated climate shocks, resort to forced early marriages for their daughters as a desperate survival strategy. This robs girls of their childhood, their education, and their chance to choose their own path, turning a climate crisis into a crisis of rights and opportunity.

Pregnant women face particularly severe dangers. In times of disaster, access to healthcare, nutrition, and safe shelter becomes even more precarious. For many, the combination of physical stress, lack of medical support, and the chaos of displacement can be life-threatening. Some lose their lives; others see their dreams and plans for the future disappear under the pressure of simply trying to stay alive.

Despite all this, women are not only victims of the climate crisis—they are also on the frontlines of climate action. From tending fields and managing scarce resources to organizing their communities and raising their voices in movements like Fridays for Future, women are central to both survival and resistance. Vanessa Nakate emphasizes that this frontline role deserves recognition and respect. When women speak out against climate change, they are speaking not just for themselves, but for millions whose stories and struggles are too often ignored.

By amplifying these realities, Vanessa is making it clear that climate justice must include gender justice. Listening to women on the frontlines is not optional; it is essential to understanding the true cost of the climate crisis and to building responses that protect lives, rights, and futures across African communities and beyond.
