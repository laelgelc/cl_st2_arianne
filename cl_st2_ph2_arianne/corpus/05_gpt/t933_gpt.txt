Greenpeace’s story is deeply connected to the lands, waters, and peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast. In 1971, as the organization’s founders prepared to sail to Amchitka to protest nuclear testing, the crew of the Phyllis Cormack travelled to ‘Yalis, a Kwakwaka’wakw community. There, they were welcomed in ways that carried profound cultural and spiritual meaning.

Members of the crew received blessings and were ceremonially adopted, and they were given a Sisiutl crest. The Sisiutl, a sacred symbol in Kwakwaka’wakw culture, represents balance and protection. It is not simply an image or a logo; it is part of a living cultural and spiritual tradition. The gift of this crest was an act of trust and support for the voyage against nuclear testing.

Over time, as Greenpeace grew and took on new campaigns, that sacred crest was changed. For an anti-whaling campaign, the original design was altered and hybridized. In doing so, Greenpeace used a powerful Kwakwaka’wakw symbol outside its original context, reshaping it to fit organizational needs. This constituted cultural appropriation: a sacred image, given under specific cultural protocols and responsibilities, was adapted without fully respecting its meaning or origin.

Decades later, this history demanded a response. In 2015, Greenpeace entered into a new collaboration with Kwakwaka’wakw artist Beau Dick to redesign the crest. This was not just an artistic decision, but part of a broader effort to address harm, correct the record, and change how the organization related to this powerful symbol.

That same year, a renewal potlatch ceremony was held. During the potlatch, apologies were made for the earlier misuse of the Sisiutl crest. The ceremony marked a commitment to retire the altered version and move forward differently. A ship was blessed with the new flag bearing Beau Dick’s redesigned crest, symbolizing a renewed relationship and a clearer understanding of the responsibilities attached to these images and stories.

This process was about more than updating a campaign symbol. It was an attempt to correct narratives that had overlooked or distorted the role of Kwakwaka’wakw communities in Greenpeace’s origins, and to publicly acknowledge that the Sisiutl is not Greenpeace’s to redefine. By retiring the old version and raising a new flag born of collaboration and ceremony, Greenpeace took concrete steps to honour the community that had supported that first voyage and to confront a painful chapter in its own history.
