In November, a series of encouraging developments showed how people, governments and institutions are beginning to shift away from fossil fuels and take environmental protection more seriously.

In Greece, the country’s electricity system ran entirely on renewable energy for five consecutive hours on October 5. For that period, demand was met without fossil fuels, a milestone that demonstrates how rapidly renewable capacity is growing and how it can reliably power a modern grid. While it was only a few hours, it marks a concrete step in reducing dependence on coal, oil and gas.

In the United States, New York moved forward with a major policy to phase out new gasoline-powered vehicles. The state advanced a rule that will ban the sale of new gas cars by 2035, with a mandatory ramp-up in zero-emission vehicle sales beginning at 35% in 2026. This creates a clear timeline for transforming the vehicle market and cutting emissions from one of the most polluting sectors.

There was also a significant shift in the Arctic, where the oil and gas company Equinor postponed the Wisting oil field project. This delay makes it likely that the field will not be developed, which in turn would prevent the release of large quantities of CO2 that would have come from extracting and burning that oil. In a region already heavily impacted by climate change, halting new fossil fuel expansion is particularly important.

In Indonesia, residents of Jakarta secured a second legal victory in their struggle for clean air. They won an appeal in a lawsuit over air pollution, resulting in a ruling that obliges the government to establish air quality standards and concrete strategies to address the problem. This decision reinforces the principle that clean air is a right and that authorities must be held accountable for protecting public health.

At the international level, opposition to deep sea mining gained a powerful new voice. During COP27, French President Emmanuel Macron publicly supported a ban on deep sea mining. His endorsement adds weight to growing calls from governments, scientists and civil society to protect fragile deep ocean ecosystems from industrial exploitation.

Taken together, these developments—from renewable energy milestones and fossil fuel project delays to legal victories for clean air and rising political resistance to destructive extraction—illustrate how diverse actions around the world can push us toward a more just and sustainable future.
