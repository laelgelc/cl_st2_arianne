From its very first voyage, Greenpeace has woven creative activism and art into its environmental and peace campaigns. In 1971, as activists set sail on the Phyllis Cormack to oppose U.S. nuclear testing in Amchitka, they painted peace and ecology symbols on the boat’s sails. That combination of bold visual messaging and direct action helped capture public attention and contributed to a powerful movement that ultimately led to the cancellation of future nuclear tests in the area.

Over the following five decades, artists across the world have continued to play a vital role in Greenpeace’s work. Through music, visual design, and creative protest, they have helped make complex issues visible, emotional, and impossible to ignore. Their contributions have ranged from campaign imagery to on-the-ground actions that turn streets, buildings, and public spaces into platforms for change.

Among these artists is Swiss pioneer Harald Naegeli, whose sprayed stick figures appeared on walls across Zürich between 1977 and 1979. His work, created without official permission, challenged conventional ideas about where art belongs and what it can say. Naegeli’s actions came at a personal cost: he faced arrest, went into exile, and ultimately served jail time. Yet his persistence and commitment to artistic expression made him a significant figure in the history of urban art.

In 2020, Naegeli returned to Zürich and chose to support Greenpeace’s 50th anniversary. He donated drawings for a special auction marking five decades of environmental activism. His gesture connected the early days of his own artistic resistance with Greenpeace’s long-standing use of creativity as a tool for change.

This spirit also underpins the Hope through Action mural project, inspired by Naegeli’s contribution. In 12 cities around the world, artists have created public murals that invite people not just to look, but to act. Each mural is a call to transform concern into concrete steps—signing petitions, writing letters, or joining protests.

By bringing art onto streets and into communities, Hope through Action turns walls into meeting points between artists, activists, and the public. It shows how creativity can open conversations, spark emotions, and make it easier for people to see themselves as part of a wider movement. From painted sails on a small boat to murals spanning city blocks, Greenpeace’s history demonstrates that art is not just decoration—it is a powerful force for mobilising people and amplifying demands for a just, peaceful, and sustainable world.
