For decades, sustainability labels have been promoted as a simple solution to complex problems. Logos on chocolate bars, coffee packets, cooking oil, animal feed, or wooden furniture promise forests protected, wildlife safe, and workers treated fairly. But many of these certification schemes are failing to live up to their claims.

Labels attached to cocoa, coffee, palm oil, soy, and wood products – including well‑known schemes such as FSC, PEFC, and Rainforest Alliance – are widely used and highly visible. They give the impression that buying “certified” means buying “responsible”. Yet these systems often do not prevent deforestation, ecosystem destruction, or serious human rights abuses. Violations of Indigenous rights and workers’ rights have been documented even where certification is in place.

Since the 1990s, as these labels have grown in popularity, they have also become a convenient shield for business as usual. Companies can continue sourcing from destructive supply chains while pointing to certification logos as proof of their “sustainability”. This risks misleading people who want their purchases to support climate action and environmental protection, not undermine them.

Relying on individual consumers to navigate a maze of labels is no substitute for real accountability. Tackling the climate crisis, biodiversity collapse, and deepening inequality demands changes to the rules that govern global trade and production – not just better marketing on supermarket shelves.

That means governments in both producer and consumer countries must step up. Stronger regulations are needed to ensure that products linked to deforestation, ecosystem destruction, or human rights abuses cannot be placed on the market in the first place. Effective tracking systems must follow commodities from where they are grown or harvested right through to the final product, so that abuses cannot be hidden behind complex supply chains.

Companies, too, have to go far beyond box‑ticking certification. They need robust, enforceable standards that genuinely protect forests and ecosystems and respect human rights, including Indigenous and labor rights, throughout their operations and supply chains.

The responsibility for fixing a broken system cannot rest on individual shoppers trying to “buy the right thing”. Real solutions require political will, strong laws, and corporate practices that match the scale of the climate, biodiversity, and inequality crises we face.
