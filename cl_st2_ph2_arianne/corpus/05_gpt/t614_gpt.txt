Nestlé has announced new steps to address its role in the global plastic pollution crisis, following mounting public pressure and a petition signed by over 3 million people calling for action on single-use plastics. In its statement, the company commits to reducing single-use plastics, expanding reusable packaging options, and working toward a goal of 100% recyclable or reusable packaging by 2025.

Among the measures Nestlé highlights are new reusable packaging models, including Häagen-Dazs ice cream containers designed for reuse and dispensers for products like NESCAFÉ, MILO, and water. These initiatives signal a shift toward refill and reuse systems that could, in principle, help cut down on the flood of disposable packaging entering landfills, incinerators, and the environment.

However, Greenpeace is raising serious concerns about both the ambition and transparency of Nestlé’s plans. While the company has made public commitments, it has not disclosed how much plastic it actually produces. Without clear data on its total plastic footprint, it is impossible for the public, policymakers, or investors to assess whether Nestlé is truly reducing its contribution to the plastic crisis or simply reshaping it.

Greenpeace also points out that the current scale of Nestlé’s reusable packaging initiatives is far too small to match the urgency and magnitude of the problem. Limited pilots and niche product lines do not yet represent the kind of systemic shift needed to move away from single-use packaging. For a company of Nestlé’s size, meaningful change requires large-scale transformation of how products are designed, delivered, and consumed.

A further concern is Nestlé’s continued reliance on recycling as a central solution. The company’s goal of making all packaging recyclable or reusable by 2025 does not address the fundamental issue that most plastic is never actually recycled. Globally, only about 9% of plastic has been effectively recycled, meaning the vast majority ends up being burned, buried, or polluting ecosystems. Designing packaging to be recyclable on paper is not the same as ensuring it is reused or recovered in practice.

Crucially, Greenpeace notes that Nestlé has not presented a clear plan to reduce its overall use of single-use packaging. Without explicit, measurable commitments to cut the total volume of throwaway packaging it produces, the company risks perpetuating a system built on disposability, even if some materials are technically recyclable.

In response to Nestlé’s announcement, Greenpeace is urging the company to go beyond incremental adjustments and public relations statements. What is needed, Greenpeace argues, is a genuine, large-scale reduction in single-use plastics and a rapid expansion of reusable, refillable delivery systems. Only by cutting the production of throwaway packaging at the source can Nestlé help build the waste-free future that millions of people are demanding.
