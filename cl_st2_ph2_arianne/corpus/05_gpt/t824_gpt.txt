In New York, Greenpeace activists recently hand-delivered a powerful message to some of the world’s biggest book publishers: stand up for free speech and the Canadian boreal forest.

The message didn’t come in the usual form of a petition or an email. Instead, it arrived as books—each one filled with community photos and the names of over 500,000 people calling on publishers to act. These half a million voices are urging major publishing houses, including Macmillan, Penguin Random House, Simon & Schuster, and HarperCollins, to confront a critical issue: their paper supply chains and their links to Resolute Forest Products.

Resolute Forest Products has been logging in intact areas of the Canadian boreal forest and has lost Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certification on more than 6 million hectares of forest. At the same time, the company has pursued lawsuits against environmental advocates. For the hundreds of thousands of people whose signatures filled those books, this combination—destruction of intact forests and legal attacks on critics—raises urgent concerns about both environmental protection and freedom of expression.

The publishers’ responses to this call for action were mixed. In some cases, doors stayed closed: certain companies refused to meet or ignored the delivery of the books altogether. These reactions stand in stark contrast to the public concern reflected in the signatures and photos gathered from communities around the world.

One publisher, however, took a clear public stand. Hachette issued an open letter criticizing Resolute’s actions and demanding improvements. By doing so, Hachette has sent a signal to both the industry and its readers that the source of the paper behind the books we love matters, and that attacks on environmental advocacy are unacceptable.

The delivery of these books in New York is not the end of the story. Greenpeace has made it clear that this is part of a longer struggle to protect the Canadian boreal forest and to defend the right to speak out for the environment. The organization has vowed to persist in calling on publishers to use their influence to push for better forest practices and to reject attempts to silence environmental defenders.

Half a million signatures bound into books is more than a symbol—it is a reminder that readers, communities, and environmental advocates are watching, and that the choices publishers make today will echo through the world’s forests and the future of free speech.
