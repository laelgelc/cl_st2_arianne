Our oceans connect us all. Whether we live in a coastal village or a landlocked city, the seas shape our climate, our weather, and the food systems that billions of people depend on. Yet these vast blue spaces, so essential to life on Earth, are under unprecedented pressure.

Greenpeace’s Ocean Ambassadors – a diverse group of artists, actors, scientists, explorers, and many others – have come together around a simple, urgent truth: we share a responsibility to protect the most fragile places on our planet. From the icy waters of the poles to the warm, biodiverse tropics, the ocean is a lifeline for people and nature alike.

Today, that lifeline is fraying. Climate change is heating and acidifying the seas, pollution is choking marine habitats, and overfishing is emptying waters that once teemed with life. Whales, turtles, dolphins, and countless other species are caught in the middle of this crisis. Their survival is closely tied to our own.

Healthy oceans do far more than host incredible wildlife. They help cycle carbon, playing a critical role in limiting the worst impacts of climate change. When marine ecosystems are thriving, they act as powerful buffers, helping to stabilize our climate and support the food security of billions of people. When they are degraded, everyone is at risk.

That is why the Ocean Ambassadors are calling for a strong Global Ocean Treaty and a vast network of new ocean sanctuaries around the world. These protected areas would give marine life the space it needs to recover and flourish, shielding ecosystems from destructive human activities and building resilience in the face of a rapidly changing climate.

A robust treaty, coupled with ambitious protection on the water, would not only safeguard whales, turtles, and dolphins; it would also help secure a safer future for communities everywhere. From fishers whose livelihoods depend on healthy stocks, to families whose food and wellbeing are tied to the sea, the benefits of thriving oceans reach far beyond the shoreline.

This is a global challenge, but it is also a shared opportunity. By supporting a strong Global Ocean Treaty and a truly global network of ocean sanctuaries, we can choose a future where life in our seas – and on land – has a fighting chance.
