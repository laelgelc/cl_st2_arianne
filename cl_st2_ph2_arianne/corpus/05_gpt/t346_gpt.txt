The climate crisis is not just an environmental emergency; it is a profound injustice that deepens existing inequalities and racial discrimination. Around the world, racialized communities are being hit hardest by extreme weather, forced migration, and systemic barriers that limit their ability to recover and thrive. These impacts are not accidental. They are rooted in a long history of exploitation, from slavery to ongoing colonialism, that has treated certain people and places as sacrifice zones.

Today’s polluting industries, especially fossil fuels, are a direct continuation of that extractive mindset. Oil, gas, and coal operations are overwhelmingly sited in or near communities of color, where they poison the air, water, and soil. This exposure leads to severe health problems and, in many cases, premature death. The people who live with these daily harms are often those who have contributed the least to the climate crisis, yet they bear its most devastating effects.

As the planet warms, floods, droughts, storms, and sea-level rise are displacing millions, creating waves of forced migration. Once again, the people most affected are those with the fewest resources and the least political power. Racialized communities face greater obstacles to receiving aid, rebuilding homes, and accessing safe places to live, deepening cycles of poverty and exclusion. The climate crisis magnifies these injustices, turning existing fault lines of race and class into chasms.

At the same time, many of the most effective defenders of the climate and the living world are the very communities most under threat. Indigenous Peoples, in particular, play a critical role in protecting forests and other ecosystems that are vital for stabilizing the climate. Their knowledge, stewardship, and resistance to destructive projects are essential to any real solution. Yet they are frequently criminalized, dispossessed, or ignored while corporations continue to profit from extraction.

Confronting the climate crisis therefore means confronting racism and colonialism. It requires centering racialized communities, including Indigenous Peoples, in decision-making and in the design of climate solutions. That means listening to those who live on the frontlines of pollution and climate impacts, respecting their rights, and supporting their leadership in resisting harmful projects and building alternatives.

A truly just response to the climate crisis demands a rapid, fair transition away from fossil fuels and other extractive industries. This just transition must prioritize the needs and rights of those who have been most harmed, ensuring that new energy systems and economies do not replicate old patterns of exploitation. It calls for a #FossilFreeRevolution that dismantles the power of polluting industries and replaces it with systems rooted in equity, care, and respect for people and the planet.

The communities least responsible for climate breakdown are already living its harshest realities. Standing with them, and following their lead, is not optional—it is the only path to a livable, fair future for everyone.
