After two years of relentless global campaigning, nearly 700,000 people have helped secure a major victory for our oceans and the people who depend on them. Thai Union, the world’s largest tuna company and owner of brands like John West and Chicken of the Sea, has committed to a series of significant reforms that could help transform the tuna industry.

Central to Thai Union’s commitments is a pledge to tackle destructive fishing practices. The company will reduce its use of fish aggregating devices (FADs) by 50% and double its supply of FAD-free fish by 2020. It will also shift more of its tuna sourcing to pole-and-line or troll-caught methods, which are more selective ways of fishing and can help reduce pressure on marine life.

Thai Union has also agreed to extend its moratorium on at-sea transshipment. This is a key step in addressing the serious human rights and labor abuse issues that have been linked to transshipment practices in the fishing industry. To further strengthen oversight at sea, the company will ensure that observers are present on its longline vessels, adding an extra layer of monitoring and transparency.

Beyond changes on the water, Thai Union is developing a code of conduct to help protect workers throughout its supply chain. An independent audit of the company’s progress is planned for next year, an important measure to verify that the promises made are being put into practice.

This breakthrough shows that when hundreds of thousands of people demand better from the world’s biggest seafood companies, those companies can be pushed to act. Now other brands and retailers must follow suit and adopt similar commitments to support truly sustainable and ethical fisheries.

The work does not end here. Thai Union’s new promises must be turned into real change on the water and in processing plants, and the company must be held accountable for delivering on its commitments. By continuing to stand together, we can help protect our oceans and the workers who rely on them, and push the entire tuna industry toward a fairer, more sustainable future.
