Every year on March 8, fossil fuel companies rush to wrap themselves in purple banners and hashtags, eager to celebrate International Women’s Day. They sponsor breakfasts and panel discussions, promote discount codes and special offers, tweet about women’s careers and the gender gap in tech, and plaster their logos across cultural events. All of this is presented as evidence that they care about gender equality.

This is gender-washing: using the language and imagery of women’s rights to polish a dirty reputation. It’s the gendered cousin of greenwashing, where the same companies try to look environmentally responsible while continuing to fuel climate breakdown. The glossy campaigns and sponsorships are designed to distract from what their business is actually built on: extracting, transporting, processing and burning fossil fuels.

Those core activities are not harmless. They cause pollution that poisons air, water and soil. They lead to spills that devastate communities and ecosystems. They drive the climate crisis, which is making extreme weather more frequent and more destructive. And the impacts are not evenly shared.

Women are often hit first and worst by environmental damage and climate breakdown. When crops fail, when water sources are contaminated, when storms and floods destroy homes and livelihoods, women’s responsibilities for care and survival intensify. Displacement and disaster can increase the risk of gender-based violence. The very activities that keep fossil fuel profits flowing are the same ones that deepen these vulnerabilities.

No amount of branded tote bags, “women in tech” tweets or sponsored cultural activities can erase that reality. A company cannot meaningfully claim to stand for women’s rights while driving a crisis that disproportionately harms women and exposes them to greater violence and insecurity.

If fossil fuel companies truly care about women’s rights, the path is clear. They must stop using International Women’s Day as a PR opportunity and stop gender-washing their image. Most importantly, they must stop the pollution, stop the spills, and stop driving climate breakdown at its source.
