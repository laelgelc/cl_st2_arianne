Fossil gas is often sold to the public as a “clean” or “bridge” fuel, but in reality it is a climate killer, a driver of war, and a daily threat to people’s health and safety across Europe.

A major part of Europe’s greenhouse gas emissions comes not only from burning gas, but from methane – the main component of fossil gas – leaking at every stage of its life cycle. Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas, and every leak, from wells to pipelines to end-use, accelerates the climate crisis. One stark example is a sunken gas rig that continues to leak methane into the environment, illustrating how the fossil gas industry leaves behind dangerous, polluting wreckage that keeps harming the climate long after operations stop.

At the same time, fossil gas is helping to fund Russia’s war in Ukraine. Even after the invasion, EU countries have continued to pay billions of euros for Russian gas imports in the absence of a full embargo. Every shipment and every contract channels money into a war machine, contradicting Europe’s stated commitment to peace, human rights, and a rapid transition away from fossil fuels.

Fossil gas is also deepening energy poverty. As prices spike and volatile gas markets drive up bills, millions of people in Europe struggle to heat their homes, cook, or keep the lights on. Families are forced to choose between paying for energy and covering other essentials. This isn’t an unfortunate side effect; it is a structural feature of an energy system built around fossil fuels and corporate profit, rather than people’s basic needs.

Inside homes, gas appliances create additional, hidden harms. Gas boilers, heaters and stoves can release pollutants that contribute to respiratory problems, especially for children and people with existing health conditions. Gas systems also carry a constant risk of leaks and accidents, from carbon monoxide poisoning to explosions. The idea that gas is a safe, modern household fuel ignores the reality of these health hazards.

Despite all this, the EU’s RePowerEU plan largely treats the crisis as a supply problem to be solved by finding new sources of fossil gas. Instead of using the moment to break free from gas, the plan focuses on replacing Russian gas with other imports and new infrastructure. On top of that, EU policymakers have proposed labelling fossil gas as “green” in investment rules, opening the door for more public and private money to flow into gas projects that lock in emissions for decades.

This is the opposite of a serious climate and security strategy. Prolonging dependence on fossil gas, just with different suppliers, keeps Europe exposed to price shocks, geopolitical blackmail, and accelerating climate breakdown. It also delays the shift to solutions that are already available and increasingly affordable.

Europe needs a clear, rapid phase-out of fossil gas by 2035 at the latest. That means investing in renewable energy like wind and solar, scaling up energy efficiency, and massively improving building insulation so homes stay warm with far less energy. These measures cut emissions, reduce bills, and protect people from volatile fossil fuel markets. They also offer real energy security: a system based on clean, local, and reliable sources instead of imported gas that finances war and fuels the climate crisis.

Choosing renewables, efficiency and insulation over fossil gas is not just a technical decision. It is a choice about what kind of future Europe wants: one where people can afford to live in warm, healthy homes on a stable planet, or one where we keep pouring money into a fuel that heats the atmosphere, deepens inequality, and helps pay for bombs. The path to true security and climate safety is clear: phase out fossil gas and build an energy system that works for people and the planet.
