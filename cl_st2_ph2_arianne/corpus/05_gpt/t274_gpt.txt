The remnants of Hurricane Ida tore through the Northeast US with an intensity that shattered records and lives. In just a few hours, the storm dumped unprecedented amounts of rain on New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, and Maryland, overwhelming drainage systems and turning streets and basements into deadly traps. Flash floods swept through neighborhoods, a tornado ripped through communities, and more than 40 people lost their lives.

In Brooklyn, the author watched the storm unfold from a relatively safer vantage point. There was minor flooding in their neighborhood—nothing like the catastrophic scenes playing out elsewhere—but the sense of vulnerability was unmistakable. Between checking on loved ones and refreshing news feeds, the contrast was stark: for some, Ida meant delayed trains and soggy sidewalks; for others, it meant the loss of homes, livelihoods, and family members.

Those losses did not fall evenly. The impacts of Ida, like so many climate-fueled disasters, were disproportionately borne by marginalized communities. People living in basement apartments, low-income neighborhoods, and areas with inadequate infrastructure faced the gravest dangers. Many of those who died were trapped in their homes as floodwaters rose faster than warnings could reach them or evacuation could be made possible. The storm exposed, yet again, how deeply inequality shapes who is most at risk when extreme weather strikes.

Officials did not mince words in the aftermath. They connected Ida’s ferocity to the fossil fuel-driven climate crisis, placing the storm in the broader context of a world already being reshaped by human-caused warming. The Northeast’s deluge came amid a cascade of global extremes: wildfires tearing across landscapes, punishing heat waves pushing temperatures to new highs, and floods inundating communities on multiple continents. These are not isolated anomalies; they are part of a pattern scientists have been warning about for decades.

That warning was underscored in the latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), described as a “code red for humanity.” The science is clear that continued dependence on coal, oil, and gas is driving more intense and frequent extreme weather events. The report’s message is not just a technical assessment; it is a moral and political alarm. It calls for an end to fossil fuel subsidies that continue to prop up the very industries fueling the crisis and insists on a just transition to renewable energy.

A just transition means more than swapping out technologies. It means ensuring that workers and communities currently dependent on fossil fuel economies are supported, not sacrificed, as energy systems change. It means centering those who are already on the frontlines of climate impacts—often low-income communities and communities of color—and making sure solutions do not reproduce the same inequalities that make storms like Ida so deadly for some and survivable for others.

The night Ida’s remnants hit the Northeast was a glimpse of the future we are accelerating toward if fossil fuel use continues unchecked. The choice now is whether to treat it as an isolated tragedy or as part of the “code red” wake-up call it so clearly is. Ending fossil fuel subsidies and rapidly building out renewable energy, in a way that is fair and inclusive, is not an abstract policy debate. It is about whether nights like that become rare warnings—or the new normal.
