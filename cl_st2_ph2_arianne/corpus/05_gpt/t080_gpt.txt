“Nature Positive” is being sold as the next big solution for the biodiversity crisis. Yet behind the polished language and big promises lies a dangerous illusion: a vague, numbers-driven concept that puts a failed economic model ahead of real protection for the living world.

At its core, “Nature Positive” allows governments and companies to claim environmental progress while continuing to destroy ecosystems. It does this by embracing the idea of net gains: damage to nature in one place can supposedly be “balanced” by restoring or protecting nature somewhere else. Forests can be cleared, wetlands drained, oceans industrialized – as long as a spreadsheet shows that, on balance, nature comes out ahead.

Proponents of this agenda have wrapped it in ambitious-sounding targets: zero net loss of nature from 2020, net positive outcomes by 2030, and full recovery by 2050. These dates and slogans suggest a clear roadmap and scientific certainty. In reality, they rest on shaky ground. The targets are not based on robust science capable of capturing the full complexity of ecosystems and species interactions.

A core problem is the search for simple indicators to stand in for the health of nature. Metrics like carbon storage or the total area of a given habitat are often put forward as key measures of success. But these indicators cannot reflect what biodiversity actually is: the diversity of species, the richness of relationships between them, the resilience of ecosystems, and the cultural and spiritual connections people have with their territories. A hectare of newly planted trees is not equivalent to an ancient forest; a restored wetland is not interchangeable with a destroyed coral reef. Treating them as if they are swappable units turns living systems into abstract assets.

This is not an accident. The “Nature Positive” agenda is closely tied to efforts to financialize nature – to turn ecosystems, species, and ecological functions into tradable units and investment products. By reducing nature to numbers that can be bought, sold, and offset, it opens the door to a new wave of greenwashing. Polluting and extractive industries can continue business as usual, while purchasing credits or funding selective restoration projects to claim they are “nature positive.”

Instead of confronting the economic model that drives overconsumption, habitat destruction, and land grabbing, this approach reinforces it. It assumes that the same systems and financial tools that have pushed the planet into crisis can somehow be repurposed to save it. In practice, it risks deepening inequalities and displacing communities, while leaving biodiversity in continued decline.

Governments negotiating global biodiversity agreements, including at COP15, should not adopt “Nature Positive” as the guiding framework. Locking such a vague and market-friendly concept into international commitments would entrench offsetting, trading schemes, and accounting tricks at the heart of biodiversity policy.

What is needed instead are clear, enforceable conservation measures that directly curb destruction, not merely compensate for it on paper. Crucially, these policies must recognize and uphold the rights of Indigenous Peoples, whose territories contain much of the world’s remaining biodiversity and whose governance and knowledge systems are central to protecting it. Strengthening Indigenous rights and community-led conservation offers a real pathway to safeguard nature, rather than repackaging old economic logics in green language.

The biodiversity crisis demands genuine protection, not clever accounting. Rejecting “Nature Positive” as the organizing principle for global nature policy is an essential step toward approaches that prioritize living ecosystems and the people who defend them, instead of the financial interests seeking to trade them.
