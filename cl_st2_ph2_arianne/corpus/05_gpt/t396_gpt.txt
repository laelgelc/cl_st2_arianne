Imagine opening your exam results and seeing a sea of red marks and missed targets. That’s the situation governments find themselves in after failing to meet the 2010 global biodiversity goals. Not a single one was fully achieved. While leaders delayed and watered down commitments, nature has been pushed to breaking point.

The reasons are not a mystery. Destructive industries such as fossil fuels and industrial agriculture have been allowed to expand and intensify, even as the warnings grew louder. Their activities are shredding ecosystems, driving species toward extinction, and destabilizing the very systems we depend on for food, water, and a safe climate.

The damage is stark. Only about 15% of the world’s forests remain intact. The rest are fragmented, degraded, or cleared, often for industrial agriculture or resource extraction. At sea, the picture is just as alarming: only around 3% of the global ocean is free from significant human impact. From overfishing and deep-sea mining prospects to pollution and climate-driven warming and acidification, the ocean is under relentless strain.

Behind this environmental destruction lies another, more insidious force: political pollution. Corporations, especially in fossil fuels and industrial agribusiness, have used their power and influence to shape policies in their favor. Instead of regulating harmful activities and supporting a rapid transition to sustainable practices, many governments have propped up the very sectors driving nature’s collapse.

This has to change, and it has to change fast.

First, governments must stop pouring public money into destructive industries. Ending subsidies for fossil fuels and harmful industrial agriculture is an essential step toward breaking the cycle of environmental degradation. Those funds need to be redirected into solutions that protect and restore ecosystems, support workers in transition, and build resilient communities.

Second, our food systems must be transformed. Industrial agriculture, with its heavy reliance on chemical inputs and large-scale monocultures, is a major driver of deforestation, biodiversity loss, and climate emissions. Shifting to sustainable, ecological food production can protect soils, water, forests, and wildlife while supporting farmers and ensuring healthy food for people.

Third, the ocean needs space to recover. Creating ocean sanctuaries—areas fully protected from industrial exploitation—is vital for rebuilding marine life, safeguarding biodiversity, and strengthening the ocean’s ability to buffer climate impacts. With only a tiny fraction of the seas relatively untouched, expanding these sanctuaries is urgent.

At the same time, economic recovery packages must be green and just. Public funds used to rebuild economies must prioritize climate-safe, nature-positive investments and support workers and communities through a fair transition. Recovery measures that lock in more pollution and destruction are simply not acceptable.

None of this will happen without clear, accountable national plans. Governments must set out how they will protect and restore nature, phase out harmful subsidies, transform food systems, and expand protection on land and at sea—and they must back these plans with real funding and transparent reporting.

Public mobilization is crucial. When people demand action—by organizing, voting, speaking out, and holding leaders and corporations to account—change becomes possible. Protecting nature is not a side issue; it is central to tackling the intertwined crises we face and to securing a livable future.

The failed biodiversity targets are a harsh wake-up call, like failing an exam that you cannot afford to retake. There is no extra planet, no backup biosphere. Governments, industries, and societies must learn from this failure, correct course, and act with the urgency the situation demands.
