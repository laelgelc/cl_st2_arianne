Annisa Rahmawaiti, a forest campaigner with Greenpeace Indonesia, is calling out the companies driving the destruction of Indonesia’s rainforests for palm oil. At the centre of this is Mondelez, the maker of Oreo, and its ongoing links to suppliers that are clearing forests, including critical orangutan habitat.

Greenpeace activists recently delivered a giant cookie to Mondelez as a bold reminder of the company’s responsibility. The message was clear: stop sourcing from rainforest destroyers like Wilmar International. This action came after years of broken promises. In 2010, Mondelez pledged to end deforestation in its supply chain by 2020. Yet between 2015 and 2017, companies supplying palm oil to Mondelez cleared more than 70,000 hectares of rainforest. Within that destruction, 25,000 hectares were identified as orangutan habitat.

These numbers represent more than statistics. They reflect the loss of irreplaceable ecosystems and the homes of endangered species, and they undermine global efforts to tackle climate change. Forests like those in Indonesia store vast amounts of carbon and support communities, biodiversity and climate stability. When they are cleared, all of that is put at risk.

Annisa is urging Mondelez to immediately cut ties with Wilmar International and other suppliers driving deforestation. She stresses that palm oil can and must be produced without destroying forests. Companies have the power and responsibility to demand truly sustainable production that protects remaining rainforests and the wildlife that depends on them.

She is also calling on people everywhere to stand with Indonesian forests. By joining the campaign, supporters can help pressure Mondelez and other major brands to clean up their supply chains, protect orangutan habitat, and contribute to the fight against climate change.
