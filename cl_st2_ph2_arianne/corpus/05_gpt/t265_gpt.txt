Walking along the shoreline in Brindisi, on Italy’s Adriatic coast, it’s impossible to ignore how deeply plastic has invaded the landscape. The sand is strewn with bottles, fragments, and packaging – a patchwork of our throwaway culture washed up by the waves. Among the debris, one object stands out: a Montecatini bleach bottle from the 1960s, still intact enough to read the label.

That single bottle tells a story stretching across decades. It shows how plastic, once produced and discarded, does not simply disappear. Instead, it lingers in nature, breaking into smaller and smaller pieces, but never truly going away. The Montecatini bottle is a relic of a different era, yet it remains a very present part of today’s pollution crisis.

Just inland from these beaches stands the Brindisi petrochemical plant, now owned by ENI’s subsidiary Versalis. Here, oil and gas are turned into plastic pellets – the raw material that will eventually become packaging, bottles, and countless other disposable products. This facility is part of a global system that begins with fossil fuel extraction and ends with plastic waste in our oceans, rivers, and communities.

The plant’s impact is not limited to the products it creates. Local people live with the consequences of industrial pollution, including gas flaring and benzene emissions. These are not abstract problems: they affect the air people breathe and the environment they depend on. Residents speak of health concerns and of a sense of betrayal. The plant arrived with promises of jobs and prosperity, but many feel those promises have not been fulfilled, while the environmental and social costs have grown.

The connection between this local reality and the global plastic crisis is direct. Big brands like Coca-Cola and Nestlé continue to drive demand for ever more plastic packaging. Their reliance on single-use plastics sustains the fossil fuel industry, giving oil and gas companies a powerful incentive to keep expanding production. As a result, plastic pollution and the climate emergency are tightly intertwined: the same fossil fuels that heat our planet are transformed into products that choke our seas and shorelines.

The bleach bottle from the 1960s, the petrochemical complex looming over Brindisi, and the branded packaging washing ashore are all part of the same chain. They show how corporate decisions made far from these beaches shape the daily lives of local communities, from the air they breathe to the water they swim in.

In Brindisi and in many other places, people are pushing back against this model and demanding something different: an economy that protects their health, their environment, and their future. Greenpeace is working alongside these communities as they seek to move away from fossil fuels and plastic dependency, and towards a green economy that no longer treats nature – or people – as disposable.
