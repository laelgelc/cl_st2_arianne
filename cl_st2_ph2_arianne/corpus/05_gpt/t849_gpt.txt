Synthetic fibers are often promoted as a more sustainable alternative to cotton because they generally use less water and avoid the toxic pesticides associated with conventional cotton farming. But this apparent advantage hides a serious problem: microplastic pollution.

According to an IUCN report, between 15% and 31% of all marine plastic pollution comes from microplastics that originate in household and industrial products. Of that, a striking 35% comes from washing synthetic textiles. Every time we wash clothes made from materials like polyester, tiny plastic fibers are shed, pass through wastewater systems and end up in rivers, seas and ultimately in the food chain.

The scale of this is staggering. In Europe and Central Asia, the amount of microplastics released is equivalent to 54 plastic bags per person every week. A single wash of synthetic clothing can release up to 700,000 microfibers. These microscopic fragments are too small to be effectively filtered out and accumulate in marine ecosystems.

Polyester, which is present in around 60% of clothing, also has a significant climate impact. Its CO2 emissions are three times higher than those of cotton, adding to the overall environmental burden of fast fashion. So while synthetic fabrics may save water and reduce pesticide use, they drive both plastic pollution and greenhouse gas emissions.

Addressing this problem requires changes throughout the fashion system. On the production side, clothing needs to be designed and made for durability and recyclability, reducing the constant churn of new garments that fuels microfiber pollution. For consumers, the most effective steps are to buy fewer new clothes, choose secondhand or upcycled items where possible, and extend the life of what we already own. Each of these choices helps cut demand for new synthetic textiles and the microplastics they release.
