Torben Lonne describes a dive in Thailand that began as an unforgettable teaching moment with a young couple, surrounded by vibrant reefs and corals. The scene, initially full of life and color, was suddenly disrupted by waves of plastic trash sweeping through the water. The mood shifted from wonder to shock as they watched plastic waste drift among fish and turtles, directly intruding on what should have been a pristine underwater world.

This experience is part of a much larger crisis. Torben points out that up to 12 million tonnes of plastic enter the ocean every year. This pollution threatens marine ecosystems and the animals that depend on them, from fish to turtles, and ultimately affects human beings as well. The trash he saw underwater is not an isolated incident but a visible symptom of a global problem.

As an ocean advocate and founder of Divein.com, Torben urges people to take action in their daily lives. He calls on individuals to avoid single-use plastics wherever possible and to pick up litter when they see it, preventing it from reaching rivers and seas. He also encourages using social media as a tool for accountability: when people find branded plastic waste, he suggests photographing it and posting it with the hashtag #IsThisYours to pressure companies to take responsibility for their packaging and products.

Beyond individual choices, Torben stresses the importance of community-level action. He suggests talking to local businesses about reducing their plastic use and convincing them to adopt more sustainable practices. Another step he recommends is writing letters to newspapers to raise public awareness and push for change. For Torben, these actions are essential to protect the oceans so that future generations can experience healthy reefs and thriving marine life instead of seas choked with plastic.
