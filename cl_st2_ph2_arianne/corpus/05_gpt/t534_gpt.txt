Hurricane Lorenzo’s rapid intensification to a Category 5 storm in the northeastern Atlantic was unprecedented. It was the first hurricane of such magnitude ever recorded in that part of the ocean, the strongest observed so far east, and one of the northernmost Category 5 hurricanes on record. After reaching this exceptional strength, Lorenzo transitioned into a post-tropical cyclone as it moved toward the British Isles.

Hurricanes generally form over warm tropical waters, where heat and moisture from the ocean fuel powerful, rotating wind systems. When conditions align, these storms can intensify quickly, with wind speeds increasing over a short period of time.

From 2016 to 2019, there has been a notable trend of increasing Category 5 hurricanes. While global warming may not necessarily increase the total number of hurricanes, it is linked to several changes in their behavior: storms can intensify more rapidly, produce heavier rainfall, and move more slowly. Each of these factors can increase the damage and danger associated with individual storms.

In the face of these escalating risks, cutting greenhouse gas emissions as fast as possible is critical. Accelerating efforts to reach zero emissions by 2040 is essential to help limit further warming and reduce the likelihood of more extreme hurricane behavior in the future.
