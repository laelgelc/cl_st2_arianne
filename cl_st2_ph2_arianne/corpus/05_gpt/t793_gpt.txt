Ocean plastic pollution is shocking in its scale and impact, and it is impossible to ignore how deeply it is affecting marine life and coastal communities. Jennifer Morgan highlights how this crisis is playing out in Taiwan’s waters and on its shores, where plastic waste is a visible, daily reality.

Taiwan has taken important steps to confront the problem. As early as 2002, the government banned free plastic bags in mainstream shops. This policy has helped reduce some of the most obvious waste from larger retailers, and it shows that regulation can change behaviour. Yet plastic bags remain common in many places because small businesses still use them, and the plastic problem continues to grow. The persistence of plastic in markets, street stalls and smaller shops underlines how partial measures are not enough when the scale of the crisis is so vast.

Alongside these gaps, there is a growing wave of local innovation aimed at making plastic-free living not just possible, but practical and attractive. Across Taiwan, people are experimenting with alternatives to single-use plastics, from reusable containers and packaging systems to plastic-free products and services. These local solutions demonstrate that the public is ready to move beyond throwaway culture when given real options and supportive policies.

Jennifer Morgan is clear that voluntary action and scattered initiatives cannot solve the plastic crisis on their own. She calls on the government to adopt strong, binding policies to phase out single-use plastics entirely by 2025. Such a phase-out would send a powerful signal to businesses and consumers alike, driving investment in alternatives and ensuring that plastic-free choices become the norm rather than the exception.

At the same time, Taiwan is facing another escalating challenge: rising carbon emissions. Despite its international pledge to cut emissions by 50% by 2030, the country’s emissions are still going up, driven largely by coal-fired power. This dependence on coal is directly at odds with its climate commitments and undermines efforts to protect people and ecosystems already affected by the climate crisis.

Taiwan has set out an energy transition pathway for 2025 that includes 20% renewables, 30% coal and 50% gas, alongside a phase-out of nuclear power. This marks a shift away from some of the dirtiest fuels, but it still leaves a large role for fossil fuels in the energy system. Gas, while often framed as a “bridge” fuel, is still a fossil fuel that contributes to the climate crisis.

To align with climate justice and its own promises, Taiwan must go further and faster. Jennifer Morgan stresses that the country needs to accelerate beyond its current targets and move towards 100% renewable energy. This is essential for a truly just transition—one that protects workers and communities, cuts pollution, and helps safeguard the oceans that are already under immense pressure from plastic and climate change alike.

The twin crises of plastic pollution and rising emissions are deeply interconnected. Tackling them together—through ambitious policies on single-use plastics and a rapid shift to renewable energy—offers Taiwan a path to protect its people, its coasts and its seas, and to contribute meaningfully to the global fight for a livable planet.
