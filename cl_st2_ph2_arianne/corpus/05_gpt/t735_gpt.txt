Insurance companies are sounding the alarm on climate change, but their business decisions still help keep some of the most polluting projects alive.

Major insurers and their asset management arms have more than $600 billion invested in fossil fuel companies. At the same time, they provide the insurance cover that allows coal projects to move forward. Without that insurance, many coal developments simply could not proceed. This support is critical at a moment when 1,500 new coal plants are planned worldwide, a buildout that would increase global coal power capacity by 42.7%.

There are signs of change. Sixteen insurers have already divested $22 billion from coal. Some of the world’s largest firms, including AXA, Zurich, Allianz, and Swiss Re, have taken important steps by stopping insurance coverage for new coal ventures. These moves show that when insurers act, they can directly limit the expansion of coal.

But progress is still far from what is needed. As long as insurers continue to underwrite and invest in coal, they are helping lock in more emissions and more climate damage, despite their public warnings about climate risk.

Through the Unfriend Coal network, Greenpeace is pressing the insurance industry to align its actions with its words. The demands are clear: insurers must divest from coal, stop underwriting new coal projects, and shift their financial power toward renewable energy. By exposing laggards and highlighting leaders, the campaign aims to accelerate the transition away from coal and push the insurance sector to become a genuine force for climate solutions rather than a backer of the fossil fuel status quo.
