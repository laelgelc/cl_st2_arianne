Every December, when the air in Manado turned a little cooler and the lights began to glow in windows across the city, I knew it was time for my favorite part of the year: visiting my grandmother in North Sulawesi. Christmas there was never just about presents or big meals. It was about the journey, the stories, and the landscapes that felt like a second home.

One of my clearest memories is a trip to Lembeh Island. From the boat, we could see Bitung spread out along the coast and, in the distance, the silhouette of Mount Klabat watching over everything. The sea breeze, the sound of the waves, and the green hillsides made it feel like the world was still whole and safe. Those views shaped my idea of what “beautiful” means.

That’s why it hurts so much to see what Bitung has become.

The place that once meant family and celebration is now marked by forest destruction. Where there used to be thriving forests and rich habitats, there are now scars on the land. It’s not just trees that are disappearing. The destruction is threatening the homes of incredible species like the Cenderawasih bird, orangutans, and Sumatran tigers.

What makes it even harder to accept is knowing that some of my favorite brands are part of the problem. The products I once picked up without thinking are linked to the loss of the very places and animals I grew up loving from afar. Realizing that my everyday choices were tied to the destruction of forests forced me to confront an uncomfortable truth: staying silent would mean accepting the loss of everything those childhood memories represented.

That realization followed me far from North Sulawesi, all the way to Kuta Beach in Bali. Standing there, with the waves crashing in and tourists scattered along the shore, I understood that feeling sad or angry about what was happening back home wasn’t enough. I needed to act.

So I made a commitment to direct action.

As a student, a barista, and an activist with Greenpeace Indonesia, I chose to stand with people all around the world who are fighting for forests and wildlife. That commitment took me onto a rubber boat, alongside activists from many places, united by one clear demand: that Wilmar, one of the world’s biggest palm oil traders, must #DropDirtyPalmOil immediately.

On that boat, facing the wind and the waves, our message was simple: we want greener forests and freedom for wildlife. We want a future where the Cenderawasih bird can still dance in the treetops, where orangutans can swing through intact forests, and where Sumatran tigers still have wild places to roam. We want the places that shaped our childhoods to still be there for the next generation.

I carry the memory of Lembeh Island and the view of Mount Klabat with me every time I take action. They remind me why this fight matters and who I’m doing it for: my younger self, my grandmother, my community, and all the living beings whose homes are being destroyed.

But this is not a journey I can take alone.

If you, too, feel that something precious is being lost when forests fall and wildlife disappears, I invite you to join us. Add your voice to the call for Wilmar to #DropDirtyPalmOil. Stand with activists around the world who are demanding real change from the companies driving forest destruction.

Together, we can defend the places we love and protect the forests and wildlife that still remain.
