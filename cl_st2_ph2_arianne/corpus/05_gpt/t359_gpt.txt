Fossil Capital is an economic system built on the extraction and burning of fossil fuels, propped up by a logic of endless growth that treats people and the planet as expendable. It is a system that plunders resources, concentrates wealth and power, and deepens inequalities, all while driving the climate crisis.

This model of growth has never been neutral or benign. It has always depended on the oppression of the most vulnerable: workers whose labour is exploited, communities whose lands and waters are sacrificed, and countries whose resources are stripped to fuel the profits of the few. Fossil Capital does not simply produce energy; it produces injustice. It locks us into a cycle where the benefits flow upwards, while the harms spread outwards and downwards.

The 2008 financial crisis exposed how fragile and unjust this system really is. When the bubble burst, the response from those in power was not to transform the economy, but to double down on the same logic that caused the crisis. Austerity measures were imposed in many places, slashing public services, social protections, and investments in a just and sustainable future. Instead of making those who profited from the crisis pay, governments chose to sacrifice the future of millions of people.

Those decisions are still shaping our world. The austerity that followed 2008 hollowed out the very systems that could have supported people through future shocks. When COVID-19 hit, it collided with this weakened social fabric and a climate already destabilised by decades of fossil fuel dependence. The result has been overlapping crises that feed into each other: economic insecurity, health emergencies, and escalating climate impacts.

As always, the most oppressed are paying the highest price. Low-income communities, young people facing precarious futures, women who shoulder unpaid care work and are pushed into insecure jobs, and communities already marginalised by race, class, gender, or geography are bearing the brunt. While they struggle with job losses, rising costs, and climate disasters, those who sit at the top of Fossil Capital have continued to benefit, protecting their profits and power.

The climate crisis is no longer a distant threat; it is a daily reality measured in lives lost and futures stolen. Climate deaths are mounting as heatwaves intensify, storms grow more destructive, and droughts and floods destroy homes and livelihoods. Young people are being forced to imagine their lives within the confines of a rapidly warming world, where opportunities shrink as instability grows. Women and low-income communities are pushed further to the margins, with fewer resources to adapt or recover.

At the same time, the natural systems that make life possible are being pushed to breaking point. Fossil Capital treats forests, oceans, soils, and species as mere inputs to be exploited. The result is accelerating biodiversity loss, as habitats are destroyed and ecosystems unravel. This is not just an environmental tragedy; it is a profound threat to human survival and dignity.

The crises we face are not accidents or isolated events. They are the predictable outcomes of an economic system that values profit over life, extraction over regeneration, and short-term gains over long-term survival. Fossil Capital has shown us again and again that it cannot and will not protect people or the planet.

Activist Kaossara Sani captures the urgency and clarity of this moment. Her call is not for minor reforms or superficial changes, but for action that confronts the system at its roots. The demand is simple and radical: we must break the system that is breaking our world.

That is the promise and the challenge of the #FossilFreeRevolution. It is a call to dismantle the power of fossil fuels and the economic model built around them, and to build something fundamentally different in its place. A fossil-free future is not just about switching energy sources; it is about ending a system that sacrifices the many for the wealth of the few.

Answering this call means refusing to accept austerity for the vulnerable and bailouts for the powerful. It means centring the needs and rights of those who have been most oppressed and most harmed. It means defending lives, livelihoods, and biodiversity from a system that sees them as collateral damage.

The choice before us is stark. We can allow Fossil Capital to continue driving us deeper into crisis, or we can join the movements, voices, and communities—like those represented by Kaossara Sani—who are fighting to break it. The #FossilFreeRevolution is an invitation to act, together, to end an era of plunder and injustice and to begin building a world where people and the planet come before profit.
