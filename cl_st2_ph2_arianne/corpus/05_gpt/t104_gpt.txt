COP27 in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, from November 6–18, 2022, is a critical moment for turning climate promises into real action. As the 27th UN Climate Summit, it comes at a time when the climate crisis is accelerating and the need for climate justice is clearer than ever. Recent IPCC reports show how rapidly the situation is worsening, and they underline what communities on the frontlines have been saying for years: the window to limit global heating to 1.5°C is closing fast, and governments must act now.

A central demand at COP27 is the establishment of a dedicated loss and damage finance facility. This means creating a specific funding mechanism, paid for by the nations most responsible for pollution, to support countries and communities already suffering from climate impacts they did not cause. From deadly storms and floods to slow-onset disasters like sea-level rise, loss and damage is no longer a future threat; it is a present reality. A fair outcome from COP27 must include a concrete commitment to such a facility, with clear responsibility placed on polluting nations.

Another key priority is a rapid phase-out of fossil fuels. To keep 1.5°C within reach, there can be no space for new coal, oil or gas projects. COP27 must move beyond vague language and commit to no new fossil fuel expansion, while setting timelines and pathways for phasing out existing production. This transition has to be just: workers and communities currently dependent on fossil fuel industries must be supported with new opportunities, social protection and meaningful participation in planning their futures.

Climate finance is also at the heart of COP27. Wealthy countries have promised to mobilize $100 billion annually to support low-income countries with adaptation and decarbonization. That money is essential for building resilience to climate impacts, protecting lives and livelihoods, and enabling a shift to clean, renewable energy. At COP27, there is a pressing need not only to deliver on this $100 billion commitment, but to ensure it reaches those who need it most and supports real, long-term transformation.

Nature protection is deeply intertwined with all of these priorities. Forests, oceans, wetlands and other ecosystems are vital allies in stabilizing the climate, protecting biodiversity and sustaining communities. At COP27, integrating nature protection into climate action means recognizing and supporting the critical role of Indigenous Peoples, whose knowledge, rights and stewardship are central to effective, lasting solutions. Protecting nature cannot be separated from defending Indigenous territories and ensuring their full involvement in decision-making.

The global climate movement has a crucial role to play throughout COP27 and beyond. Around the world, people are organizing, marching, striking and building powerful campaigns to push governments to act at the scale that science and justice demand. Growing activism is a sign that more and more people refuse to accept empty promises while the crisis worsens. Pressure from movements is essential to secure a loss and damage finance facility, to end new fossil fuel projects, to deliver the promised $100 billion annually, and to ensure that nature protection and Indigenous leadership are at the core of climate action.

As COP27 unfolds, the stakes could not be higher. The decisions made in Sharm el-Sheikh will influence whether the world can still limit warming to 1.5°C and whether climate justice becomes a reality rather than a slogan. It is up to governments to deliver, and up to people everywhere to keep pushing them to do so.
