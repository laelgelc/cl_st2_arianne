Luís Ferreirim, Head of Agriculture at Greenpeace Spain, is being taken to court by Valle de Odieta S.C.L., a company behind some of Spain’s biggest factory farms. His “crime” is speaking out about the impacts of industrial livestock production – including a huge dairy farm in Caparroso, with 7,200 cows, and a planned mega farm in Noviercas that would confine 23,520 cows.

This case is not an isolated dispute between one company and one campaigner. It is part of a broader pattern in Europe, where factory farms are expanding while the number of farms is falling, and small farmers are being pushed out. Across the EU, overall meat production continues to grow, even as traditional farms disappear. Industrial livestock operations concentrate thousands of animals in one place, with serious consequences for the environment, the climate, animal welfare, and rural communities.

Ferreirim has been outspoken about Valle de Odieta’s record. He points to animal mistreatment, unauthorized expansions of their facilities, and a toxic spill in the Aragón River linked to their operations. Instead of addressing these problems, the company is trying to silence criticism in court.

The lawsuit against him is a SLAPP – a Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation. SLAPPs are designed to intimidate and punish people who raise concerns in the public interest, tying them up in lengthy and costly legal battles. In Spain, there have already been several similar cases, where corporations resort to the courts to try to shut down legitimate public debate about their environmental and social impacts.

Ferreirim refuses to retract what he has said. He insists that speaking the truth about factory farms is essential to protect people, animals, and the planet. He is calling on people to help in three concrete ways.

First, share this story. When companies use the courts to silence criticism, public attention is one of the most powerful tools we have. Talking about what is happening – online, in our communities, and with our elected representatives – helps protect those who speak out and keeps the focus on the real problem: the damage caused by industrial livestock.

Second, shift towards plant-based diets. Demand for meat and dairy is what allows factory farms to grow ever larger. Choosing more plant-based foods reduces pressure on land, water, and climate, and undermines the business model that makes mega farms profitable. Individual choices alone will not fix the system, but they are part of the solution.

Third, demand that governments support sustainable farming instead of factory farms. Public policies and subsidies can either reinforce industrial livestock or help small-scale, environmentally responsible farmers survive and thrive. Ferreirim is urging people to put pressure on decision-makers to stop backing mega farms and to redirect support towards farming that respects animals, the climate, and local communities.

This court case is about much more than one person’s right to criticize a company. It is about whether those who expose environmental harm and defend a fairer food system can do so without fear of legal retaliation. By standing with Luís Ferreirim, changing what we eat, and pushing our governments to back sustainable agriculture, we can help stop the spread of factory farms and protect our shared future.
