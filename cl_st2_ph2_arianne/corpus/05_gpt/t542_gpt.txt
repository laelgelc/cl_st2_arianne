Last Friday, four million people around the world took to the streets for the largest climate protest in history, from Jakarta all the way to Antarctica. What began with one 15-year-old’s courageous act just a year ago has grown into a truly global call for climate justice, led by young people and joined by people of all ages.

While millions marched, some of us stayed in the office to help share their stories with the world. Watching the images and messages pour in throughout the day was profoundly moving. The passion, energy, creativity and humor on display didn’t just make us smile – it brought some of us to tears.

Among the most powerful parts of the day were the protest signs. Hand-painted banners, cardboard placards, and carefully crafted slogans captured the urgency of the moment and the determination of those demanding change. They were sharp, funny, heartfelt, and often disarmingly honest, distilling complex fears and hopes into just a few words or images. These signs have quickly become some of our favorite memories from this historic day, each one a tiny but potent reminder of why this movement matters.

As we look back on this incredible global strike, we’re also looking ahead. The next climate strike is already on the horizon, taking place on September 27th. After witnessing what four million people achieved together last Friday, the anticipation for what comes next is electric.
