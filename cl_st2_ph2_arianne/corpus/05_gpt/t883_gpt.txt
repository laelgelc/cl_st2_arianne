Carl Safina stands on the deck of the Greenpeace ship Arctic Sunrise in the high Arctic near Svalbard, watching a transformation unfold. As shrinking sea ice and warming waters push fish farther north, industrial fishing vessels are following. What was once a largely inaccessible, ice-bound region is becoming a new frontier for trawling.

Trawling often means dragging heavy nets across the seafloor, acting like ocean bulldozers. This method doesn’t just catch target fish. It rips through entire communities of life on the seabed. Overfishing is one consequence, but the damage goes much deeper.

Massive bycatch is an unavoidable part of this kind of fishing. Unwanted species—animals that are not being targeted—are swept up in the nets and often discarded dead or dying. At the same time, the gear destabilizes the seafloor itself, disturbing sediments and destroying the structures that many species rely on.

Delicate coral ecosystems are particularly vulnerable. Trawling can break and crush corals that took decades or centuries to grow, along with anemones, sponges, and other fragile creatures that form the living architecture of the ocean floor. When these structures are destroyed, seabed life is literally crushed, and the complex habitats that fish depend on for shelter and food are reduced or lost.

Safina argues that creating trawl-free zones is essential to protect the ocean, especially in newly accessible Arctic waters. These zones can give seafloor habitats a chance to survive and recover, safeguarding the food webs that support fish populations and the communities that rely on them.

He points to a recent agreement between retailers and fishing companies to halt the expansion of trawling in these areas until protections are in place. For Safina, this is more than just a policy step—it is a recognition of moral responsibility. As the Arctic changes, the choices made now will shape what remains for future generations.
