On the outskirts of Leuven, in Belgium, Brecht Goussey is quietly putting a different kind of food system into practice. On just 1.5 hectares of land, he runs an organic CSA (community supported agriculture) farm that currently supplies vegetables to 320 people. The members of this CSA don’t just receive a box of vegetables; they come to the farm themselves to harvest the food they eat.

Brecht didn’t start his career in agriculture. He used to work as a social worker, and that experience shapes how he thinks about farming today: as something social, shared and rooted in care. His vision goes well beyond a small vegetable plot. He dreams of building an integrated farm that combines crops, fruit trees and animals, with each element supporting the others and helping to strengthen biodiversity.

In Brecht’s vision, animals are not industrial production units but part of a living system. Their manure would help maintain and build soil fertility, reducing dependence on artificial methods. Trees and diverse crops would provide habitat and food for insects, birds and other wildlife, while also feeding people in the surrounding community. It’s a model that puts ecological health and community needs first.

But there is a major obstacle: land.

The plot Brecht currently farms is under pressure from the same forces affecting farmland across much of Europe: speculation and rapidly rising prices. Even though his farm feeds hundreds of people and nurtures the local ecosystem, he cannot afford to buy the land he works. Without secure access, his plans for a long-term, biodiversity-rich farm remain fragile.

To confront this, Brecht is not acting alone. He is supported by the cooperative ‘De Landgenoten’, which buys land and rents it out to organic farmers at affordable rates. Their model is based on community ownership: instead of land being treated as a speculative asset, it becomes a shared resource dedicated to ecological farming.

Alongside De Landgenoten, Brecht and Greenpeace Belgium are launching a crowdfunding effort to secure this farmland for ecological agriculture. The goal is to keep the land accessible to organic farmers like Brecht, protect the soil, and give biodiversity the space it needs to thrive. By helping to take land out of the logic of speculation, the crowdfunding supports a different vision: one where community-supported farms can flourish, ecosystems are restored instead of degraded, and the food on people’s plates comes from methods that work with nature rather than against it.

This is about much more than one farmer in Leuven. It is a concrete example of how communities, cooperatives and organisations can work together to reclaim farmland for ecological use, ensuring that it remains in the hands of those who grow food in ways that protect soil, water and biodiversity.
