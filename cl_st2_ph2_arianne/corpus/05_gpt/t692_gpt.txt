The first UN meeting on a Global Ocean Treaty has just wrapped up, and what happens next will help decide the fate of nearly half our planet. The high seas – the vast areas of ocean beyond national borders – are under mounting pressure from industrial fishing, pollution, and the worsening impacts of climate change. Without a strong global agreement, these waters will remain vulnerable to exploitation and destruction.

Right now, the world has a narrow window to agree a powerful Global Ocean Treaty by 2020. Such a treaty could open the door to creating ocean sanctuaries on the high seas: safe havens where marine life can recover and thrive, free from harmful human activity. These sanctuaries are essential if we’re going to give oceans a real chance to heal.

But there is a lot standing in the way. Powerful industry groups are lobbying hard to weaken protections and keep business as usual on the high seas. That’s why Greenpeace is campaigning at the UN and around the world to counter this pressure, push governments to be more ambitious, and ensure the treaty is strong enough to truly protect our oceans.

Public involvement is crucial. One of the biggest opportunities on the horizon is the proposal to create an Antarctic Ocean Sanctuary. Nearly 2 million people have already backed this idea, showing governments that there is massive global support for ocean protection. This kind of public pressure can help drown out industry lobbyists and give political leaders the courage they need to do the right thing.

During the UN meeting, Greenpeace supporters and activists took visible, creative action to keep oceans high on the agenda. Protests featured bold banners calling for protection, inflatable turtles symbolising threatened marine life, and deliveries of origami to delegates to remind them that people everywhere are watching and expecting results. These actions sent a clear message inside the negotiation halls: the world is paying attention, and the high seas must be protected.

Not all governments are moving at the same speed. Some nations are pushing hard for a strong, ambitious treaty that can create vast ocean sanctuaries and safeguard marine life. Others are lagging behind, resisting robust protections or dragging their feet. The outcome is not guaranteed, and the balance between ambition and delay is still fragile.

The conclusion of this first UN meeting is just the beginning. To secure a Global Ocean Treaty by 2020 that can truly protect the high seas, governments must resist industry pressure, listen to the millions calling for action, and choose protection over short-term profit. With continued public support and sustained campaigning, a network of ocean sanctuaries – from the Antarctic to the high seas around the world – can become a reality.
