The “Citizen Climate” series shines a light on people around the world who are stepping up for a healthier planet, and Kenyan photojournalist and activist James Wakibia is one of them. His work spans climate justice, plastic pollution, and youth mobilisation, but it is also shaped by the financial barriers that many grassroots activists face.

Wakibia describes how difficult it is to sustain activism without reliable funding. Much of his work has depended on his own limited personal resources. Grant applications have often failed, forcing him to scale down activities he knows are urgently needed. This financial strain is a common reality for many climate defenders, even as the impacts of the crisis intensify around them.

In Kenya, those impacts are already severe. Wakibia points to communities around Lake Nakuru that have been hit hard by climate-related disasters. Floods have displaced people and disrupted livelihoods. Elsewhere, job losses and recurring droughts deepen vulnerability and make it harder for families to recover from shocks. For Wakibia, addressing these realities means prioritising support for the communities on the frontlines of climate change.

He emphasises the importance of adaptation measures such as climate-smart agriculture, which can help farmers cope with changing weather patterns, protect harvests, and build resilience. Alongside this, he stresses the need for greater public awareness so that people understand both the risks they face and the solutions available. In his view, adaptation is not just about new techniques, but about informed communities who can advocate for their own needs.

Wakibia is also a prominent voice against plastic pollution in Kenya. He focuses in particular on plastics clogging rivers, where they damage ecosystems and contribute to wider environmental degradation. Using his platform, including an audience of 24,000 followers on Twitter, he shares information about the harms of plastic and the changes needed to tackle the problem at its source.

On the ground, he has been involved in activities such as river cleanups. While these efforts can clear pollution temporarily, he is clear that they are not enough on their own. Wakibia pushes for systemic solutions, especially the banning of single-use plastics, to prevent waste from entering rivers and landscapes in the first place.

His advocacy extends to the international level, where he calls for a strong Global Plastics Treaty. As governments meet in Paris to negotiate this agreement, Wakibia wants to see a treaty that seriously curbs the production of plastics made from fossil fuels and addresses the full scale of plastic pollution. He highlights how plastics harm environments and animals, and how they also affect the air people breathe and the food they eat.

Throughout his work, Wakibia sees young people as a powerful force for change. He believes youth bring connectivity, energy, creativity, and technological skills that can transform awareness into action. With these tools, they can mobilise communities, amplify stories from climate-impacted areas, and push for the policy changes needed both in Kenya and globally.

James Wakibia’s story in the “Citizen Climate” series underlines how determined individuals continue to confront intertwined crises of climate change and plastic pollution, often with limited resources but a clear vision: support vulnerable communities, stop pollution at its source, and harness the power of informed and connected youth to drive lasting change.
