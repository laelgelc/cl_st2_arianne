In Kenya, the climate crisis is not an abstract concept – it is reshaping lives, livelihoods and landscapes in real time. Photojournalist and activist James Wakibia sees this every day, and his work sits at the intersection of environmental justice, public awareness and youth-led action.

Wakibia is open about the realities of grassroots activism. Funding is scarce, and many of his efforts depend on his own limited personal finances. Grant applications often go nowhere, forcing him to scale down projects that could otherwise reach many more people. This constant struggle for resources is a major barrier for those on the frontlines of climate and environmental justice, even as the impacts intensify around them.

In Kenya, those impacts are stark. Communities around Lake Nakuru are facing devastating floods that threaten homes and safety. Elsewhere, people are losing jobs as climate disruptions hit key sectors. Droughts are becoming more frequent and severe, undermining food security and pushing already vulnerable families closer to the edge. For Wakibia, these are not statistics but stories of neighbours, friends and fellow citizens whose futures are being reshaped by a crisis they did little to cause.

He argues that supporting these communities means prioritising adaptation. Climate‑smart agriculture is one crucial pathway – helping farmers adjust to changing rainfall patterns and prolonged dry spells, and maintain their livelihoods in a warming world. At the same time, he stresses the importance of increasing public awareness so that people understand what is happening, why it matters, and how they can respond and demand support.

Wakibia’s activism also targets another escalating crisis: plastic pollution. In Kenya’s rivers, plastic waste chokes waterways and ecosystems, turning lifelines into dumping grounds. He uses his platform as a photojournalist and activist to document this pollution and push for change, highlighting how plastics threaten both people and nature.

Online, he brings these issues to a wide audience. With 24,000 followers on Twitter, he uses social media to educate, inform and mobilise – from exposing plastic pollution in rivers to explaining why single‑use plastics are such a dangerous and unnecessary part of our daily lives. He champions bans on single‑use plastics as a crucial step toward protecting communities and ecosystems.

Wakibia also connects local struggles to global decisions. He supports a strong Global Plastics Treaty being negotiated in Paris – one that tackles the problem at its source by reducing fossil fuel‑based plastic production. For him, a plastic‑free future is not just about cleaner streets and rivers; it is about transforming the systems that drive pollution and climate breakdown in the first place.

Throughout his work, Wakibia returns to the same core belief: awareness is a powerful tool for change. By documenting impacts, telling stories and sharing information widely, he aims to build the public pressure needed to shift policies and priorities. Laws and regulations do not change on their own – they change when people demand better.

He sees young people as central to that transformation. Youth, he says, bring energy, creativity and a deep familiarity with technology – all essential for mobilising communities, spreading information quickly and imagining new ways of living on a healthier planet. From social media campaigns to on‑the‑ground organising, their role is to push for the ambitious action that older generations have too often delayed.

James Wakibia’s story, as part of the “Citizen Climate” series, shows how one person can connect local realities in Kenya to global debates on plastics and climate justice. Despite the hurdles of limited funding and failed grants, he continues to document, educate and organise – insisting that those most affected by climate change and pollution must be supported, heard and placed at the centre of solutions.
