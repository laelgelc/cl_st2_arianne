When the floodwaters rose across Pakistan in 2022, they did more than wash away homes, roads, and crops. They exposed a deep injustice at the heart of the climate crisis.

Filmmaker Seemab Gul travelled through some of the hardest-hit regions – Balochistan, Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Sindh – documenting what became known as the worst floods in the country’s history. An estimated 33 million people were affected. Entire communities were displaced as homes and vital infrastructure were destroyed.

Her films focus on the people living through this catastrophe: residents forced from their villages, families trying to survive in temporary shelters, and communities watching their lands and livelihoods disappear under water. Alongside these testimonies, activists speak directly to the causes of this disaster, pointing to industrialized nations whose emissions have driven climate change, yet who are far removed from its most brutal impacts.

In the regions Gul visited, indigenous and local communities are paying the highest price for a crisis they did little to create. Their stories lay bare the imbalance between those who profit from fossil fuels and those who face the flooding, hunger, and displacement that follow.

This contrast is stark. While fossil fuel giants have made profits of around $200 billion, Pakistan’s reconstruction needs after the floods are estimated at $16 billion. Gul’s work highlights this gap as a symbol of climate injustice: immense corporate wealth built on fossil fuels, set against the urgent, unmet needs of people struggling to rebuild their lives after a human-made disaster.

Through these films, a clear demand emerges. Western nations and the corporations most responsible for the climate crisis must provide compensation and support to countries like Pakistan. The call is not framed as charity, but as a matter of justice and responsibility in the face of escalating, human-driven climate impacts.
