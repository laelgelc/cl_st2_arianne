The air was far colder than the music sounded.

In April 2019, with Arctic temperatures a startling 8 degrees above normal, a small group of musicians stood surrounded by ice and sea, their breath visible in the -12°C air. In their hands were instruments carved from the glacier itself: chimes, horns, percussion, and even a cello, all sculpted from ice that should have been far more stable than it is today.

Greenpeace had brought them there for a reason. Led by oceans campaigner Halvard Haga Raavand, the concert was a deliberate act of contrast: the beauty of music against the stark reality of a rapidly warming Arctic. Every note played on those ice instruments was a reminder that the region’s frozen landscapes are fragile and at risk of melting.

As the musicians performed, the message was clear and urgent. Greenpeace was calling on world leaders to protect 30% of global oceans by 2030. This target is rooted in the understanding that oceans are one of our most important climate allies. By absorbing carbon through marine life, they act as a buffer against climate breakdown. But as Arctic ice melts, it doesn’t just disappear quietly—it accelerates global warming, undermining that natural protection.

The concert was not an isolated event, but the opening chapter of a longer journey. It marked the start of a research voyage to the Antarctic, where Greenpeace continued its call for a strong Global Oceans Treaty. From the Arctic’s thawing ice to the Southern Ocean’s remote waters, the voyage carried the same message: the oceans need protection, and the time for world leaders to act is now.
