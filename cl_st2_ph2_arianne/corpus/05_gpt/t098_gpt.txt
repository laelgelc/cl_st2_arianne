In 2032, the world has finally begun to put people and the planet before profit and endless growth. This shift did not happen by accident. It grew from ideas that have been nurtured for generations, especially by Indigenous communities and peoples of the global majority, who have long reminded us that our choices today shape the lives of those who will come after us.

One of the guiding principles of this transformation is the commitment to consider the impact of every decision on the next seven generations. Instead of focusing on quarterly profits or short-term political cycles, societies now look far ahead: Will this action protect the air, water, soil, and communities our great‑grandchildren will depend on? Will it deepen inequality, or help repair it? This long view has reshaped how we think about everything from energy and food to housing, transport, and care.

Another key inspiration is the Ubuntu philosophy, which holds that “I am because we are.” It reminds us that our wellbeing is bound up with the wellbeing of others, human and non-human alike. In this 2032, Ubuntu is not just a beautiful idea but a practical guide. Policies are judged by whether they strengthen our connections to one another and to the Earth, rather than isolate and divide us.

The journey to this world was forged in crisis. The COVID-19 pandemic laid bare how much our societies rely on caregivers, health workers, and essential staff who are too often underpaid, undervalued, and unprotected. It showed that the people who hold our communities together are not the ones at the top of the economic pyramid, but those whose labour, love, and care make daily life possible. The pandemic also exposed how fragile and unequal our systems are, with those already facing discrimination and poverty hit hardest.

The war in Ukraine exposed another layer of vulnerability and injustice. It revealed the dangers of food and energy systems built on fossil fuels and global supply chains that prioritise profit over resilience. When fuel and grain flows were disrupted, millions were pushed closer to hunger and hardship. The crisis made clear that dependence on fossil fuels is not only driving climate breakdown; it is also entangling us in conflict, price shocks, and geopolitical power struggles.

In response to these overlapping crises, people across the world have been imagining and building alternatives. Greenpeace’s Alternative Futures programme is part of this global wave of change. It works to amplify solutions that come from the global majority – the communities who have contributed least to environmental destruction but are living with its harshest impacts. These communities are not passive victims; they are leaders in designing new ways of living that are fairer, cleaner, and more resilient.

The programme challenges the deep inequalities created and maintained by colonialism and capitalism. It questions economic models that treat land, water, and people as resources to be extracted for profit, and that concentrate wealth and power in the hands of a few. Instead, it supports visions of societies where wealth is shared more equitably, where historical injustices are acknowledged and addressed, and where decision-making is rooted in participation and consent.

Central to this vision is a just transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy. This transition is not only about switching technologies; it is about transforming who benefits and who bears the costs. A just transition ensures that workers and communities currently dependent on fossil fuel industries are supported with new opportunities, social protection, and a real say in shaping their futures. It insists that clean energy systems must not repeat patterns of exploitation and dispossession, but instead advance energy democracy and access for all.

By 2032, this just transition has helped to reshape our economies. Renewable energy is expanding, and communities are increasingly involved in owning and managing their own power. Food systems are shifting toward approaches that work with nature instead of against it, protecting biodiversity and local livelihoods. Cities and rural areas alike are rethinking transport, housing, and public spaces to reduce emissions and improve quality of life.

Equity is at the heart of these changes. Societies are starting to recognise that environmental justice and social justice are inseparable. Climate policies are being designed to reduce inequality, not deepen it. The voices of Indigenous peoples, frontline communities, and young people are being heard more clearly in decisions that affect their lands, waters, and futures.

Harmony with nature is no longer treated as an optional extra, but as a basic condition for survival and flourishing. Forests, oceans, rivers, and ecosystems are understood as living systems we are part of, not as warehouses of raw materials. Protecting them is seen as essential to protecting ourselves.

This 2032 is not a perfect world, but it is one that has chosen a different path. Guided by the wisdom of seven generations and the spirit of Ubuntu, and strengthened by the courage of communities who refused to accept a future of extraction and inequality, it shows what becomes possible when we truly put people and the planet first.
