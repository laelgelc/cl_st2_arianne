The future of the world’s oceans is being decided right now at the United Nations, where governments are negotiating a new Global Ocean Treaty that will shape how we protect the seas for decades to come.

This process is the result of nearly twenty years of talks, and the stakes could not be higher. The oceans are essential for sustaining life on Earth: they support extraordinary biodiversity and underpin the lives and livelihoods of billions of people. Yet they are under mounting pressure from destructive human activities, especially industrial fishing and the emerging threat of deep sea mining.

In response, a powerful global movement has come together. A letter signed by numerous actors, activists, and experts calls on governments to agree a strong Global Ocean Treaty. It highlights the oceans’ vital role and makes clear that current protections are nowhere near enough. Today, most of the high seas – the vast areas of ocean beyond national borders – are effectively unprotected, leaving marine life exposed to escalating exploitation.

Scientists and governments are converging around a clear goal: protecting at least 30% of the world’s oceans by 2030. Over 100 governments and many scientists now support this “30x30” target. But without a robust Global Ocean Treaty, this target will remain out of reach, because there is currently no effective way to create fully protected areas on the high seas.

A strong treaty would change that. It would make it possible to establish high seas sanctuaries – large, fully protected areas where industrial activities like industrial fishing and deep sea mining are off-limits. These sanctuaries are essential to give marine ecosystems the space they need to recover and thrive, and to help safeguard the food security and livelihoods of the billions of people who depend on healthy oceans.

Public pressure is already immense. More than 5 million people around the world are calling for a robust Global Ocean Treaty that can deliver real protection, not just words on paper. Their message to governments is clear: after nearly two decades of negotiations, there is no time left for delay or half-measures.

The world’s oceans are in crisis, but they are also at a turning point. With a strong Global Ocean Treaty, governments have a historic opportunity to secure a healthy, thriving ocean for people and nature, now and for generations to come.
