Across Europe and around the world, women are bearing the brunt of the current energy crisis. As energy prices soar and economic instability grows, the impacts are not felt equally. Women, who are more likely to shoulder responsibility for household energy use and care work, are often the first to feel the pressure of rising bills, cold homes, and difficult choices about where limited income should go.

Despite this, women remain largely excluded from the very spaces where decisions about energy systems and climate policy are made. Within the European Union, women hold only 26.8% of environment minister posts. In the energy sector more broadly, they occupy just 12% of leadership roles. This gap in representation is not just a matter of fairness; it has real consequences for the kind of policies that are designed and whose needs they serve.

Evidence links women’s leadership with better environmental outcomes, and women tend to be more supportive of renewable energy and more environmentally friendly in their attitudes and behaviours. This is especially visible in the home, where women often manage everyday energy use—deciding how to heat and light living spaces, cook food, and care for children and older relatives. Yet their lived experience and practical expertise rarely translate into political or corporate power.

Energy poverty is one of the clearest expressions of this inequality. Around the world, women are more exposed to the health risks of inadequate or polluting energy. In many contexts, they spend more time in kitchens and living spaces where toxic smoke from dirty fuels harms their lungs and overall health. In colder climates, “excess winter deaths” linked to poorly heated homes and unaffordable energy disproportionately affect women, especially older women and those on low incomes. These overlapping vulnerabilities deepen existing gender inequalities and trap many women in cycles of poverty and ill health.

Recognising access to affordable, clean energy as a human right is essential to breaking this cycle. A just transition away from fossil fuels cannot be achieved if it leaves women behind or ignores the specific ways in which energy systems shape their lives. Gender-sensitive energy policies are needed—policies that account for who controls resources, who is exposed to risks, and who has a voice in decisions.

This means putting women at the centre of energy planning and climate action, from community initiatives to national ministries and corporate boardrooms. It means designing support for households in energy poverty with an understanding of gendered responsibilities and vulnerabilities. And it means acknowledging that a fair, sustainable energy future depends not only on technology and investment, but also on whose perspectives are heard and valued.

The current energy crisis is a stark reminder that social justice and climate justice are inseparable. Ensuring that women have equal access to clean, affordable energy—and equal power in shaping energy systems—is not optional. It is a prerequisite for a truly just transition.
