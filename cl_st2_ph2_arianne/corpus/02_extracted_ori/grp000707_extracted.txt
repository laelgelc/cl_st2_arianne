The fight against the climate crisis is also a fight for global equality. The strong engagement of women around the world is powerful and key in advancing climate and environmental protection .
Hear from some of the women at Greenpeace from across the globe about the work they do every day and the change they want to see in this world. On this International Women’s Day, and every day, let’s celebrate all the women standing up for our planet. Tell us, who is inspiring you?
Note: when we use the term ‘women’, we are inclusive of all women – trans, non-binary and cisgender.
