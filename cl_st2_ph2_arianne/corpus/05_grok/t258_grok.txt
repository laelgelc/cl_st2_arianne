The world has already warmed by 1.2°C since pre-industrial times, and we're facing a deepening climate crisis where governments and companies continue to make empty promises. It's clear that urgent action is essential to break our reliance on fossil fuels and animal products, while also stopping the deforestation that's putting biodiversity, Indigenous Peoples, and the global climate at serious risk.

Forests play a crucial role in storing carbon, but their destruction—often driven by industrial agriculture—diminishes this vital capacity and releases additional emissions into the atmosphere. According to a Carbon Brief analysis that factors in deforestation, Brazil ranks as the fourth biggest polluter globally. During Bolsonaro's leadership, deforestation in the Amazon has surged dramatically, raising the possibility that this critical rainforest could become a net carbon emitter.

Adding to the emissions challenge, animal production accounts for 19% of global greenhouse gases, with nearly half of that coming from methane.
