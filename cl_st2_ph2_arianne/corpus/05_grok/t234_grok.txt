The Amazon rainforest is facing unprecedented destruction, with a staggering 21.97% increase in deforestation rates, marking the highest level since 2006. Between August 2020 and July 2021, 13,235 km² of the forest were destroyed under President Bolsonaro's administration.

This surge comes amid the government's actions to slash environmental protections and weaken monitoring agencies, putting Indigenous Peoples at greater risk.

The data, released following the COP26 climate summit, lays bare Bolsonaro's greenwashing efforts. The summit's agreement, in fact, allows for continued destruction.

Such rampant deforestation drives Brazil's elevated carbon emissions, poses health risks from smoke generated by fires, disrupts climate balance, and fuels violence against Indigenous communities—where 263 individuals were killed in 2020 alone.

It's time for world leaders to reject deals with Bolsonaro, insist on deforestation-free supply chains, and bolster support for Indigenous sustainable practices.
