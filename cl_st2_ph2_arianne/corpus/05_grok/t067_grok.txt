Indigenous leaders from Canada, Brazil, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Indonesia traveled to COP15 in Montreal to push for their rights in the final biodiversity agreement. Their efforts led to recognition in the Kunming-Montreal framework, which acknowledges their knowledge and practices as essential for protecting biodiversity.

Even with obstacles such as visa delays, these leaders took part in marches, press conferences, and interruptions of speeches. They stressed the importance of traditional knowledge over technology and called out their exclusion from negotiations.

A historic march drew over 3,500 people and spotlighted the leadership of Indigenous women in defending nature and rights.
