The 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Olympics demonstrated a strong commitment to renewables, with six venues powered by clean energy and an overall zero-emissions target. This focus on sustainability comes at a critical time, as climate change is profoundly affecting winter sports. Melting snow is forcing athletes to seek new training sites, disrupting their preparations and the future of these events. A study has revealed that nine past and future Olympic cities may soon become too warm to reliably host the games, underscoring the urgent threat to this global tradition.

Yet, amid these efforts, sponsor Samsung stands out for the wrong reasons. The company's emissions have risen by 55% since 2010, and it relies on only 1% renewables in its energy mix. This performance sharply contrasts with their taglines promoting innovation and a better future. We urge Samsung's CEOs to make a genuine shift to clean energy, helping to combat the climate crisis that endangers events like the Olympics and so much more.
