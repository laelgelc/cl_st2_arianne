A global brand audit conducted by Greenpeace has exposed the significant role multinational corporations play in plastic pollution. Shockingly, one truckload of plastic enters our oceans every minute. This audit involved 10,000 volunteers across 42 countries who audited 187,000 pieces of trash during 239 cleanups. The results identified the top polluters as Coca-Cola, which was found in 40 countries and ranked in the top three on six continents, followed by PepsiCo, Nestlé, Danone, Mondelez International, and Procter & Gamble.

These companies are criticized for their reliance on disposable plastics. We urge systemic change and greater corporate responsibility to address this crisis. While consumers are making efforts to reduce plastic use, it's clear that brands must step up. Join us in holding them accountable by sharing photos of branded litter using the hashtag #IsThisYours to pressure these corporations.
