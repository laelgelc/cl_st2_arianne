Greenpeace East Asia recently tested 30 major cosmetic brands, following our discovery of microplastics in 170 types of seafood. We ranked these brands based on their commitments to eliminate microbeads, which are tiny plastics used in exfoliants. These microbeads pollute oceans, harm marine life, and enter the food chain.

Unfortunately, the brands' pledges often include loopholes stemming from varying definitions, which allow continued use of these harmful materials. None of the brands met full environmental standards. Even top scorers, such as Beiersdorf, only removed polyethylene while ignoring other plastics.

The effective solution lies in government bans on all solid microplastics in personal care products, similar to those implemented in the US. In the meantime, consumers can turn to apps and guides to help avoid products containing microbeads.
