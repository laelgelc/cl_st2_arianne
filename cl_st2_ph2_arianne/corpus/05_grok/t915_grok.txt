At Greenpeace, we're relentlessly campaigning for a toxic-free future, working to eliminate persistent, toxic, bioaccumulative, carcinogenic, and hormone-disrupting chemicals from our world. There are some hopeful signs on the horizon, such as increasing company transparency, the implementation of REACH regulations, and substitutions happening in various industries—though we know acceleration is urgently needed to make real progress.

To strengthen our efforts, we've just completed a two-year research project conducted by our Science Unit at Exeter University. This work reassessed our Detox strategy, with a sharp focus on key sectors including electronics, toys, cosmetics, household products, and textiles. The research zeroed in on six major chemical groups: PFCs, phthalates, heavy metals, BPA, BFRs, and APs/APEs.

Through this investigation, we compiled a comprehensive list of over 17,000 potentially hazardous chemicals. Our analysis of supply chains uncovered widespread toxic pollution, largely driven by a lack of transparency and information across these systems.

We're making this open research available to everyone, sharing it widely to support broader detoxification efforts and drive collective action toward a safer, cleaner planet.
