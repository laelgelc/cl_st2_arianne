Reuse and refill systems have long been traditions in many countries, existing well before the surge in single-use plastics that began in the 1960s. This shift toward single-use items was driven by corporate greed from brands like Nestlé, Unilever, Coca-Cola, and PepsiCo. It's time to hold these corporations accountable and push them to transition toward reuse. While individual actions matter, we need systemic change to make this happen.

Countries in the Global South are leading the way with innovative models. In India, the Dabbawalla and thali systems showcase effective reuse practices. Across Africa, bans on single-use items are helping reduce waste. Chile has implemented refillable bottle mandates, and Brazil has seen success with returnable systems. In the Philippines, the Zero Waste movement includes Wala-Usik stores that promote zero-waste living.

Let's join the reuse revolution. Explore our database of initiatives to see more examples and get involved.
