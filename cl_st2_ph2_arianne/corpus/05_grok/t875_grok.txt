US President Obama has announced the world’s largest ocean sanctuary, marking a significant step forward in marine protection. At the same time, governments are convening at the UN to work on a treaty aimed at safeguarding the high seas, an area where currently less than 1% enjoys protection.

Scientists are calling for at least 30% of the oceans to be protected, which would help revive marine life, rebuild fish stocks, and combat climate change. While governments have committed to protecting 10% by 2020, most are falling behind on this goal.

At Greenpeace, we’re pushing for strong sanctuary rules to ensure effective conservation. The benefits of such protections are clear: they can quadruple biomass and biodiversity, boost economies through tourism and fisheries, and enhance climate resilience by storing carbon.

There’s still more work to be done to secure a robust UN deal that delivers on these promises.
