Over 3 million people have signed a petition calling on Nestlé to reduce single-use plastics, and now the company has issued a statement outlining its plans. Nestlé pledges to cut single-use plastics and introduce reusable packaging options, such as Häagen-Dazs ice cream containers and dispensers for NESCAFÉ, MILO, and water. The company also aims for 100% recyclable or reusable packaging by 2025.

At Greenpeace, we're responding to this statement, and while we acknowledge these steps, we see significant shortcomings. There's a lack of transparency on plastic production volumes, which makes it hard to gauge real progress. The reusable initiatives mentioned are not at a sufficient scale to make a meaningful impact. Nestlé's approach relies too heavily on recycling, which is only 9% effective. Moreover, there's no clear plan to reduce overall single-use packaging.

We urge Nestlé to commit to genuine reductions in single-use plastics to help build a waste-free future.
