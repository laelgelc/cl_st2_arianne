Greenpeace has long advocated for affordable clothing that is free from hazardous chemicals. In 2011, we launched the Detox My Fashion campaign to push for change in the industry. The following year, in 2012, we suspended sales of our textile products until we could provide transparent proof of chemical-free production processes.

Since that time, our efforts have led to commitments from 80 companies to eliminate hazardous chemicals from their operations by 2020. Our "Destination Zero" report details the progress made in areas like transparency and supply chain improvements, which have also inspired broader initiatives across the industry.

A pilot project in 2018 showed that Detox-compliant production is feasible. Starting in April 2019, we began trialing a new standard for our merchandise, including items like t-shirts and bags. This involves applying best practices and third-party tools to ensure chemical elimination and transparency, working with selected suppliers. While this trial is underway, the suspension on textile sales remains broadly in place.
