Lawrence Ferlinghetti, the renowned American poet and founder of City Lights Bookstore, passed away on February 22, 2021, at the age of 101 due to lung disease. His life and work left an indelible mark on literature and environmental activism, particularly through his involvement with Greenpeace.

In 1977, Ferlinghetti joined the Greenpeace ship James Bay during a campaign to protect whales. While aboard, he penned a poem inspired by a dream, which he entered into the crew's Dreambook. The poem drew on the imagery of Moby Dick to symbolize the destruction of wild nature by modern technology. He later published this work in the 1978 issue of Northwest Ecolog.

Ferlinghetti also contributed another dream-inspired poem, titled "Rough Song of Animals Dying," to the Greenpeace Chronicles. This piece addressed the Greenhouse Effect and the extinction of species.

Through his poetry, Ferlinghetti's pacifism and his legacy from the Beat era helped awaken environmental awareness, inspiring others to confront the threats facing our planet.
