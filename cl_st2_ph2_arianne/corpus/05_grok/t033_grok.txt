The climate crisis doesn't exist in isolation—it intersects deeply with gender inequality and human rights, creating compounded challenges that demand urgent attention. A key focus is the critical role of girls' education in paving the way for women's active involvement in climate decision-making processes.

Women face significant economic disadvantages within the patriarchal structures of the fossil fuel industry, including persistent pay gaps. These issues are worsened by rising energy costs and pollution, which hit women harder and increase their vulnerability to gender-based violence as well as the devastating effects of extreme weather events.

Activists point out that women tend to support renewable energy initiatives more strongly than men. To address these interconnected problems effectively, intersectional approaches are vital, helping to lessen the impacts and empower women to take on leadership roles in the fight against climate change.
