Greenpeace has conducted an investigation into Asia Pulp & Paper (APP) and the Sinar Mas Group, revealing that nearly 8,000 hectares of forest and peatland have been cleared in concessions linked to the group since 2013. This includes 3,000 hectares in the concession of PT Muara Sungai Landak.

In 2013, APP introduced its Forest Conservation Policy, along with commitments to restoration. The company has made some progress, such as conserving over 500,000 hectares through the High Carbon Stock Approach and conducting peatland mapping.

However, APP has not addressed deforestation at the group level or issues related to transparency. As a result, Greenpeace has decided to end its engagement with the company. We view APP as untrustworthy in these matters.

Going forward, Greenpeace will call on APP's customers and investors to demand reforms from the company or to withdraw their support.
