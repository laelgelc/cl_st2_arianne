During my recent visit to the beaches of Brindisi on the Adriatic coast, I was struck by the sheer amount of plastic waste scattered across the shore. Among the debris, I spotted a bleach bottle from the 1960s, produced by Montecatini, which serves as a stark reminder of how plastic can linger in the environment for decades.

Nearby, the local petrochemical plant, now under ENI's Versalis ownership, manufactures plastic pellets using oil and gas. This operation adds to the pollution in the area, with issues like gas flaring and benzene emissions.

Demand for plastic is fueled by major brands such as Coca-Cola and Nestlé, which ties the plastic crisis directly to the broader climate emergency and sustains the fossil fuel industry.

Residents in the community have shared their worries about health impacts and expressed frustration over the plant's failure to deliver on promised economic benefits.

At Greenpeace, we stand with these affected communities, helping them move toward a green economy.
