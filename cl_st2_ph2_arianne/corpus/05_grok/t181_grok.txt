Growing up in the Philippines, I have fond memories of reusing glass Coca-Cola bottles and refilling canisters at local stores. These practices not only reduced waste but also built a sense of community pride.

Today, that world feels distant amid the flood of plastic pollution from single-use packaging produced by brands like Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, Nestlé, and Unilever. This plastic, derived from fossil fuels, is fueling climate change.

The real issue lies in corporate overproduction, not individual actions. As negotiations for a global plastics treaty continue, Coca-Cola has set a goal of 25% reusable packaging by 2030. But we need bolder commitments: 50% reusable packaging from Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, and Nestlé.

It's time for people to reject greenwashing and push for a plastic-free future.
