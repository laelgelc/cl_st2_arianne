Imagine stepping into the year 2100 with teenagers Sunny and Ho in Green Future's three-part animated series, a climate education project by Greenpeace. In this future, climate change has eroded many of the planet's natural wonders, and the duo embarks on eye-opening adventures.

They begin by visiting "The Last Tree" exhibition, where rare butterflies, flowers, and fruits are on display, highlighting what's at stake. Next, they dive into a flooded underwater city, following playful sea otters through submerged ruins. At a restaurant, Sunny and Ho turn down meat options, instead picturing the vast land devastation caused by industrial farming.

But the series doesn't stop at warnings—it paints a brighter picture too. Viewers see cities powered by solar and wind energy, along with plant-based food choices that help preserve the environment. Through these stories, the animation calls on everyone to take action now, paving the way for a sustainable future for the planet and generations to come.
