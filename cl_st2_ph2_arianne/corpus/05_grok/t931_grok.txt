Herakles Farms' palm oil project in Cameroon has drawn sharp criticism for its plan to destroy 70,000 hectares of forest, even though the company lacked a valid land lease and encountered strong local opposition. The company stands accused of intimidating critics, violating judicial independence, and pushing for presidential intervention to impose a burdensome New York arbitration clause on employee grievances. Now, the project is mired in crisis, with operations halted, minimal development achieved, rents and taxes left unpaid, promises to communities unfulfilled, and workers laid off. Despite new management and investors pressing on, the venture faces lawsuits over unpaid wages and discrimination. Meanwhile, activist Nasako Besingi has been convicted for his peaceful protests against the project. At Greenpeace, we continue to call for sustainable land use that respects local communities and protects the environment.
