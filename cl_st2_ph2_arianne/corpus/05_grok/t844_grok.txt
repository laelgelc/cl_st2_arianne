The Arctic is in crisis, with sea ice hitting record lows, underscoring the urgent need for real protection. Yet, the European Parliament's recent resolution on the Arctic falls short, prioritizing empty words over meaningful action.

Why do EU governments continue to permit fishing in previously unfished Arctic waters, even as they claim to support a moratorium? And why have oil lobbies succeeded in diluting demands for a complete ban on Arctic oil extraction?

Consider Norway's plans for new drilling in the region, or Shell's decision to abandon exploration off Alaska. There's also the declaration by Obama and Trudeau making certain areas off-limits.

It's time to hold governments accountable: demand they stop fossil fuel expansion, shift investments to renewables, back a UN oceans treaty, prohibit heavy fuel oil use, and implement fishing moratoriums. Join the push for a court case aimed at halting oil rigs in the Arctic.
