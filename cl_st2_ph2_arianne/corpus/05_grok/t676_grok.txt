In a landmark decision, the Urgenda Foundation has secured a victory in the Dutch Court of Appeal, upholding a 2015 ruling that mandates the Netherlands to reduce emissions by 25% from 1990 levels by 2020. With only 13% achieved so far, this ruling points to the need for shutting down the country's remaining coal plants to meet the target.

The court's decision underscores the vital role of judicial systems in upholding human rights obligations to protect against the harms of climate change. This ruling arrives at a critical moment, aligning with the release of the IPCC's report on limiting global warming to 1.5°C.

It serves as a stark warning to governments around the world: update climate policies urgently or risk facing similar legal challenges. This case is part of a broader wave of legal actions seeking climate justice, including lawsuits by Swiss seniors, U.S. youth, and investigations in the Philippines targeting fossil fuel companies for their role in the crisis.
