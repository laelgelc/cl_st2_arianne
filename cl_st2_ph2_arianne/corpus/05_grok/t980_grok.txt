Greenpeace is thrilled to celebrate G-Star's new commitment to eliminate hazardous chemicals from its supply chain and products by 2020. This makes G-Star the 15th global corporation to join the Detox movement, standing alongside brands like Uniqlo, Benetton, and Victoria’s Secret.

This pledge marks a significant improvement over G-Star's previous half-hearted efforts, now featuring concrete elimination dates, greater transparency, and upcoming case studies on substituting toxic substances.

For too long, the fashion industry has polluted waterways with hazardous chemicals, while some brands have made loophole-filled greenwashing commitments. But public pressure has successfully transformed G-Star and Levi’s from greenwashers into Detox leaders.

We urge everyone to share the "Detox Fashion" video and keep demanding more action from brands like GAP and Calvin Klein.
