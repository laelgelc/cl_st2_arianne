Young people around the world, including millennials like myself, are taking bold steps to protest and sue governments over their failure to act on climate change. We're demanding intergenerational justice and equal rights to a safe future for everyone.

In successful legal battles, Colombia's Supreme Court has ruled that deforestation in the Amazon violates human rights. Meanwhile, ongoing lawsuits in the United States and in Canada's Quebec province are arguing that government policies infringe on young people's constitutional and equality rights.

Courts in the Netherlands and New Zealand have affirmed their authority to address climate issues. By combining these legal actions with mass mobilizations such as #FridaysForFuture, youth are challenging the status quo and holding leaders accountable.
