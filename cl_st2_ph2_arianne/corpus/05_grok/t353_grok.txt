The ocean's vast expanse shimmers with breathtaking beauty, from vibrant coral reefs teeming with life to the rhythmic dance of waves under the sun. Yet beneath this serene surface lurk hidden threats: pollution choking marine ecosystems, overfishing depleting vital stocks, illegal fishing evading regulations, eutrophication fueling harmful algal blooms, the escalating climate crisis warming waters and acidifying seas, and plastic pollution entangling wildlife and infiltrating food chains.

On this International Women’s Day, we celebrate the courageous women around the world who are at the forefront of the fight to preserve ocean health, maintain social stability, and ensure food security. These women recognize the critical role oceans play in sustaining life, especially as one billion people worldwide rely on fish as their primary source of animal protein—a figure that rises to 70% in Senegal.

In West Africa, women alongside small-scale fishermen are standing up against the fishmeal and fish oil (FMFO) industry and foreign vessels that overexploit local fish stocks. These operations export products to Asia and Europe, leaving communities deprived of essential resources and facing economic hardship.

It's time for governments to step in with protective measures, including granting legal status to women in these efforts. Join us in a global online applause to thank these inspiring women for their unwavering dedication.
