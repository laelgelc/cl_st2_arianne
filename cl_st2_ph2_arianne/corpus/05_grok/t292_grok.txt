In the Vital Ocean Voices series, Aurelie Hector, a Mauritian scientist and the daughter of a fisherman, shares her personal story to highlight the impacts of destructive fishing, pollution, and climate breakdown on communities in the Indian Ocean. Growing up, she was raised like a boy and often fished alongside her father, where she witnessed the declining catches caused by larger fleets and the depletion of marine life. This deep connection to the ocean inspired her to pursue a career as a conservation biologist. She graduated with a BSc in Biology and now works at the Mauritian Wildlife Foundation. In her role as Round Island Senior Warden, she has protected seabirds from invasive species, monitored ecosystems, removed fishing debris, and cleaned plastic pollution from coastal areas.
