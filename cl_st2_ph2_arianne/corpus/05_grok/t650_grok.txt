As the holiday season wraps up, many of us are left staring at piles of single-use plastic packaging from gifts—wrappers, bags, and containers that seem designed to be discarded immediately. It's a stark reminder of the plastic crisis we're facing: only 9% of plastics are actually recycled, and every minute, the equivalent of a truckload of plastic enters our oceans. This pollution is devastating marine life and infiltrating our food chains, with consequences that ripple through ecosystems.

The real culprits here are corporations that push a culture of convenience and mass consumption, all while shifting the blame onto individual consumers for not recycling enough. But change is possible when people demand it. In 2018, consumer pressure led companies like Kroger, McDonald's, and Starbucks to take steps toward reducing plastics, beginning with phasing out items like straws. Yet, these efforts are just the start—far more comprehensive action is required.

For 2019, let's make resolutions that count: commit to eliminating single-use plastics from our own lives and push corporate and political leaders to phase out throwaway plastics completely. By doing so, we can tackle the profound environmental, health, and justice impacts of this pervasive problem.
