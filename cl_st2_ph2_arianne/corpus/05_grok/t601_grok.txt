Imagine a world where our energy comes entirely from renewable sources, powering sustainable development for all. This vision includes dedicated funding to ensure a just recovery from the devastating impacts of climate change, while providing essential support to communities that have long depended on fossil fuels.

At the heart of this transformative idea is the Green New Deal, introduced by Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Senator Ed Markey. It represents a bold vision for equality that transcends partisan divides, and it's supported by a majority of people in the United States, including conservatives.

Though the Green New Deal isn't perfect, it must prioritize phasing out fossil fuels and stopping the construction of new fossil fuel infrastructure.

The urgency is clear from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which calls for immediate action. Global youth movements are rising up, and countries like Ireland and the UK have declared climate emergencies, all underscoring the need to act now to prevent catastrophe.

The costs of inaction are immense, with disproportionate effects on vulnerable groups who bear the brunt of climate impacts.
