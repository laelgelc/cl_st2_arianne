Romania's journey away from coal has been fraught with difficulties, particularly evident in the failures of the 1990s that led to massive job losses and deep social scars in areas like the Jiu Valley. At Greenpeace Romania, we're pushing for a just transition to renewable energy sources that ensures no one is left behind.

Our proposals focus on creating energy communities and empowering prosumers, including former miners who can produce and consume their own electricity through photovoltaic systems. This approach helps maintain local identity while addressing energy poverty.

We're encouraged that authorities have integrated these ideas into the Just Transition Plans, which are supported by EU funding. This includes subsidies for installing solar panels in households and developing small-scale renewable energy projects for public buildings.

The Decarbonisation Law establishes a coal phaseout by 2032, and upcoming workshops will help build the necessary legal frameworks to make this transition a reality.
