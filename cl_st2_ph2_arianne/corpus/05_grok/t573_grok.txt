Deep sea mining companies have been pushing a narrative full of myths to justify their operations, but the truth reveals serious risks to our planet. Let's debunk three of these key myths.

First, they claim deep sea mining is a "green" solution that supports clean energy transitions, such as renewables and electric vehicles. In reality, this activity could actually worsen climate change by disturbing seabed sediments and releasing stored carbon into the ocean and atmosphere.

Second, proponents argue that deep sea mining sidesteps the human rights abuses often associated with land-based mining. However, it poses significant threats to communities that depend on the ocean for their livelihoods, as well as to marine environments that sustain life.

Third, there's the assertion that minerals from the seabed are crucial for technologies like smartphones. This claim lacks substantiation from the IT sector itself, which hasn't confirmed such a necessity.

Rather than pursuing deep sea mining, we should focus on building a circular economy. This means prioritizing recycling of metals, reducing overall metal consumption, and encouraging tech giants to take the lead in innovating solutions that safeguard our oceans.
