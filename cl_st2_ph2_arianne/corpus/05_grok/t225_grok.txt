In northern Russia, underground peat fires known as "zombie fires" are becoming more prevalent. These fires can persist even under snow, creating risks for the 2022 fire season.

Last year set a record with 18.8 million hectares burned, and the smoke from those fires reached the North Pole. Currently, smouldering fires in the Urals are producing smoke that affects Yekaterinburg.

These zombie fires act as a "climate bomb" because they release high levels of greenhouse gases from burning ancient organic matter.

Greenpeace Russia, with its expertise in combating such fires, has offered assistance to the regional government for prevention and extinguishing efforts, and this offer has been accepted.
