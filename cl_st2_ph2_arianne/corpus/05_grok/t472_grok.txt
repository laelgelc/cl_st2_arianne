Back in 1961, my father sat me down and explained the harsh reality of oil depletion. He described how oil is a finite resource, and as it gets harder to extract, costs would rise, leading to production peaks that signal the beginning of the end for easy oil.

Fast forward to today, and we're seeing those predictions play out in global oil production declines. Oil output in regions outside the US, Russia, and Saudi Arabia peaked back in 2017. There are now warnings of sharp drops coming in Russian and Saudi production as well.

The so-called US shale boom? It's looking more like an unsustainable bubble, fueled by massive debt and causing serious environmental damage. It's been compared to a Ponzi scheme, one that's already leading to a wave of bankruptcies in the sector. Tar sands projects are failing too, and the entire oil industry is grappling with investors pulling out.

It's clear we need to transition to renewables now, before the economic fallout and climate risks from clinging to oil become even more devastating.
