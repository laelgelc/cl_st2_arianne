As we look ahead to 2021, there's a sense of hope for a post-pandemic world where we can reclaim some renewed normalcy. Yet, challenges continue to linger, shaping what many are calling the "new normal."

Among these, climate change-linked threats are starkly evident. In Kenya, invasions of desert locusts are putting food security at risk and sparking concerns about the use of harmful pesticides to combat them.

The year has already seen a wave of extreme weather events around the globe. Beijing experienced sandstorms, while Australia faced floods following bushfires. Nepal dealt with forest fires, and Angola suffered deadly flash floods. Spain saw a record snowstorm, Indonesia grappled with floods linked to land clearing, and South Korea recorded its coldest day in decades. Cyclone Eloise brought devastation to Mozambique and nearby countries, Texas endured a polar vortex that led to blackouts, and floods in the Amazon impacted Indigenous communities.

It's clear that collective action from governments is essential to address the climate crisis, ensuring safety and equity for all.
