In the aftermath of the 2011 TEPCO nuclear disaster in Fukushima, Mr. Toru Anzai, a 73-year-old resident from Iitate, was forced to evacuate his home. The trauma of witnessing the destruction and loss initially left him unable to pick up his camera and photograph the scenes around him.

It wasn't until 2012, when he met photojournalist Kikujiro Fukushima, that Anzai found the inspiration to resume his work. Since then, he has captured the post-disaster townscapes, evacuated areas, and ongoing recovery efforts through approximately 40,000 photos and videos.

Anzai has shared his documentation through exhibitions held in Tokyo, Fukushima, and Yamaguchi. In 2018, he made the difficult decision to demolish his dilapidated home.

Today, living in Date near the restricted zones, Anzai continues to document Fukushima's current state, aiming to preserve these records for future generations amid the persisting challenges.
