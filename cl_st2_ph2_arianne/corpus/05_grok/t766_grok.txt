In a powerful act of peaceful resistance, ten activists—including Greenpeace founder Rex Weyler and the children of founders Dorothy and Irving Stowe—blocked a Kinder Morgan construction site in Coast Salish territory near Vancouver, Canada. Their action delayed a tar sands oil pipeline that violates Indigenous rights, threatens air and water, and contributes to climate change. Standing in solidarity with Indigenous communities, they aimed to preserve ecological integrity.

The group was arrested, adding to a growing wave of resistance actions, which includes a recent march of over 10,000 people.
