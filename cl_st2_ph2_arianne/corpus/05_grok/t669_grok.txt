As a forest campaigner with Greenpeace Indonesia, I've seen firsthand how companies are driving the destruction of rainforests for palm oil production. That's why our activists recently delivered a giant cookie to Mondelez, the company behind Oreo, to demand that it stop sourcing from rainforest destroyers like Wilmar International.

Back in 2010, Mondelez promised to end deforestation in its supply chain by 2020. But from 2015 to 2017, its suppliers cleared more than 70,000 hectares of rainforest, including 25,000 hectares of orangutan habitat.

It's time for Mondelez to cut ties with Wilmar and commit to sustainable palm oil production. I urge everyone to join our campaign to protect Indonesia's forests and fight climate change.
