Join us for an inspiring 15-day online film festival showcasing 15 powerful documentaries that dive into pressing environmental challenges, innovative practical solutions, and inspiring initiatives led by global citizens. From the comfort of your home, you can watch all the films for free and get involved by voting for your favorites. Cast your vote for the People's Award, given to the film with the most votes, or help determine the Favourite Film Award, awarded to the one with the most views. The winning films will then be screened in cities across France, sparking public debates and discussions.

Among the highlights is Ground for Hope, which explores sustainable farming practices. Secret of the Oceans sheds light on ocean communities facing the impacts of climate change. Banking Nature examines the financial threats looming over our natural world. Other films tackle critical issues like nuclear power, dysfunctions in the dairy industry, the extinction of wildlife, land-grabbing practices, the waste from electronics, and more.

We encourage you to dive in, engage with these stories, and take simple actions to make a difference in protecting our planet.
