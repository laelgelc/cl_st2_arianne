As the world grapples with the devastating impacts of human-induced climate change and the ongoing war in Ukraine, it's clear that both crises are deeply intertwined with our global dependency on fossil fuels. Ukrainian scientist Svitlana Krakovska has highlighted this connection, pointing out how our reliance on these dirty energy sources exacerbates both environmental destruction and geopolitical conflicts.

Fossil fuel companies continue to profit immensely from these conflicts and crises, reaping financial gains while the planet and its people suffer. It's time for governments worldwide to take decisive action by phasing out fossil fuels immediately. This shift is essential not only for achieving climate security but also for fostering lasting peace.

Fossil fuels make up over 80% of global energy supply, and this dominance has long fueled geopolitical imbalances and wars, including Russia's invasion of Ukraine. By perpetuating this dependency, we're enabling the conditions that lead to such aggression and instability.

Instead, we must focus on reducing energy demand through greater efficiency measures and accelerating the transition to renewable energy sources. Renewables offer significant advantages: they can be installed much faster, are cheaper to deploy, and are far less susceptible to the power struggles that plague fossil fuel markets.

We call on leaders to divest from Russian fossil fuels, impose embargoes on them, and prioritize providing humanitarian aid to those affected by the conflict. History is rife with examples of oil-related conflicts, and we're seeing companies exploit the current crisis for their own benefit. Breaking free from fossil fuels is the path forward to a more secure and equitable world.
