Last weekend, a massive crowd of 35,000 people converged on Lützerath, Germany, to stand in defense of the village. The community faces demolition to make way for the expansion of RWE's Garzweiler coal mine, which lies above 280 million tons of lignite. This expansion poses a serious threat to Germany's carbon budget under the Paris Agreement, even though there's no actual need for the additional energy.

Activists have been occupying the site for over two years, but they encountered violent eviction by police during the recent events. This powerful demonstration in Lützerath represents a broader symbol of global resistance against the crimes of the fossil fuel industry. Similar struggles are unfolding in places like East Africa, Argentina, India, and North America, where communities are fighting back against destructive projects.

At Greenpeace, we're standing with these frontline defenders and supporting their efforts. We're calling for real accountability, especially since just 100 companies are responsible for 70% of global emissions. These corporations continue to prioritize profits, often with the complicity of governments that enable their actions.
