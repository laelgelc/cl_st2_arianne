In a climate emergency, while leaders fail to act, millions are demanding change. Over seven million people have joined street protests, with the last two Fridays marking the largest climate marches ever, led by students and school children. From Wellington to Washington and about 4,000 places worldwide, marches featured creative displays like puppet oil CEOs and giant globes. The post highlights masterpieces from the latest event and calls for continued weekly strikes until leaders heed science, with the next global strike on November 29. Newcomers are welcomed, and participants urged to bring friends.
