At COP27, talks on "loss and damage" have finally been formalized for climate-vulnerable communities, pushing for justice and putting an end to the destructive models of polluters. This is a critical step toward holding those responsible accountable for the harm inflicted on the most affected regions.

Extractivism, rooted in colonial legacies, continues to drive pollution and deepen inequality, primarily benefiting richer nations at the expense of others. It's time to break free from this outdated system that exploits resources without regard for local communities or the environment.

African leaders must reject new fossil fuel investments, not just for the planet, but for their own people's future. They should demand the climate finance they are owed and take the lead in a just transition to renewable energy sources. Fossil fuels are at the heart of the climate crisis, pumping out emissions that fuel global warming and demand an urgent shift to prevent even greater harms ahead.

We've seen the devastating impacts firsthand: droughts and floods that are ravaging African economies, wiping out livelihoods and infrastructure. To avoid repeating these tragedies, a rapid move away from fossil fuels is essential.

Inspiring examples are already emerging. Kenya's President Ruto and Morocco's King Mohammed VI are showing the way by leapfrogging to clean energy solutions. They're resisting neocolonial extractivism and focusing on addressing energy poverty through sustainable means, proving that a better path is possible.
