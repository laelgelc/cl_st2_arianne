I recently visited Berap village in West Papua, where Indigenous leaders from the Namblong tribe are mapping clan boundaries to block palm oil plantation permits that threaten their forests. This effort is part of a broader struggle to protect their ancestral lands. A key highlight is the groundbreaking lawsuit led by Hendrikus ‘Franky’ Woro, who is challenging a Malaysian company's permit on traditional lands.

At a Papuan cultural festival in Jakarta, young people gathered to discuss forest conservation, state violence, identity, and the loss of local foods like sago. These conversations underscore the deep connections between culture and the environment.

Globally, deforestation is driven by capitalism for commodities, and we must end it to protect biodiversity. On World Forest Day, it's crucial to emphasize cultural resistance and the transmission of Indigenous wisdom to youth for systemic change.
