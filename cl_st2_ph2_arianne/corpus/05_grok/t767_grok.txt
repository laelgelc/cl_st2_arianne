Humanity has long ignored critical warnings about the perils of unchecked population growth. Thinkers like Thomas Malthus and John Stuart Mill highlighted the risks of populations outstripping Earth's resources, and Paul Ehrlich's 1968 book "The Population Bomb" amplified these concerns, predicting that rapid growth would exceed ecological limits. The consequences we're seeing today include widespread resource depletion, collapsing biodiversity, and escalating humanitarian crises.

One supposed solution, the Green Revolution, has instead exacerbated problems. Its intensive agricultural practices have led to severe soil degradation, disruption of the nitrogen cycle, and contributions to global heating.

These issues persist in stark ways. Crop yields are stagnating, fisheries are declining, and water scarcity now impacts 850 million people. Malnutrition is on the rise, even as population growth rates have slowed.

To avert further ecological destruction, we must tackle population stabilization and overconsumption head-on. The sheer scale of human impact remains a primary driver of these crises.
