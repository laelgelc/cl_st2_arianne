Knock knock.

Who's there?

Climate change.

Climate change who?

That's the point – it's not going away. It's a persistent threat knocking at our door, and we need to protect our Earth because there's no Planet B.

As the world grapples with COVID-19, we can't afford to go back to heavy reliance on fossil fuels once the pandemic eases. Climate change hasn't taken a break amid the health crisis; it's still here, making its presence felt.

This year, worsening annual floods in South Asia have affected 9.6 million people. In China, 37.89 million people have been impacted, including 10,000 evacuations in Anhui and Hubei. One-third of Bangladesh is flooded, affecting 2.8 million people. Northeastern India has seen 6.8 million affected, with devastation also hitting Nepal, Indonesia, and Japan.

In Kenya, floods in May and June displaced thousands, caused deaths, and destroyed crops and livestock, as extreme weather intensifies in East Africa due to the climate crisis.
