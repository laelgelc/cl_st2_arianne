Since 2013, our Greenpeace Arctic campaign has brought together over eight million people from around the world in a powerful push to create a protected sanctuary around the North Pole and stop destructive industries such as oil drilling. This global mobilization has achieved significant victories, including forcing Shell to retreat from its plans and shining a spotlight on the threats through bold actions like the protest in Russia where 30 activists stood up against exploitation.

These efforts have also dramatically reduced the prospects for Arctic drilling. We've seen unforgettable moments that captured worldwide attention, from turning back an icebreaker in Portland to organizing bicycle rallies in Bangkok, all part of highlighting the urgent need for protection.

Working behind the scenes, the campaign has raised financial and reputational risks for companies involved, while weakening the ties between corporations and politicians. This has led some Arctic nations to move toward stronger protections for the region.

At its core, this movement is about respecting Indigenous Peoples and sparking inspiration for broader global change to safeguard our planet's fragile Arctic.
