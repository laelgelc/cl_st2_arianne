As we set sail on this three-month Greenpeace voyage across the Pacific, one of our first big tasks was provisioning food for the 25 people on board. We made stops in Curacao and Panama to pick up fresh ingredients, then spent time unpacking and storing everything securely for the journey ahead.

I'm from Taiwan and completely new to life at sea, so dealing with seasickness has been a real challenge. I've been managing it with fresh air on deck, breathing techniques, seasickness pills, and by avoiding caffeine. Our onboard medic, Loes, has been a huge help in getting through those rough patches.

The big waves we've encountered have turned the kitchen into chaos at times, with things sliding around, and they've disrupted sleep on the bunk beds, making rest a bit of a struggle.

Our French chef, Laurence, keeps us going with healthy meals, and volunteers pitch in to assist in the galley even when the ship is rolling. That includes sorting waste as part of our routine to keep things sustainable on board.
