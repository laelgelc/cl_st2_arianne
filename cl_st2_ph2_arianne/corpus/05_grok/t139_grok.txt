As we dive into Plastic Free July, it's a perfect time to rethink our relationship with single-use plastics. Simple personal actions, like switching to reusable cups, bags, and bottles, can help cut down on this waste—but we know these steps alone only make a small impact.

The real change needs to come from holding major polluters accountable. Companies like PepsiCo, Nestlé, Unilever, and Coca-Cola are responsible for much of the plastic pollution crisis, yet their efforts on reuse and refill systems remain negligible. For instance, Coca-Cola has committed to reaching 25% reusable packaging by 2030, but it must do better to meet this goal. PepsiCo, on the other hand, has said it will set a refill goal by the end of the year.

That's why we're calling on you to join us. Sign our Greenpeace petition and download our toolkit to demand that these corporations shift to robust reuse systems. Together, we can push for the systemic changes that will truly reduce plastic pollution.
