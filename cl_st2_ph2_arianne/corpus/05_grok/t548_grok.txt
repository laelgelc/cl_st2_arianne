The plastic pollution crisis is harming wildlife, human health, and the environment through microplastics and toxins. There is a pressing need to reduce plastic production, especially amid planned industry expansion.

The Break Free From Plastic movement's 2018 brand audits identified top polluters like Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, and Nestlé, based on volunteer cleanups. While companies are making promises to reduce impact, these fall short.

Join us for larger brand audits during World Cleanup Day on September 21, using a toolkit to hold corporations accountable. Register your event to join the global movement.
