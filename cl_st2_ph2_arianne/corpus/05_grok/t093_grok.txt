The path to meeting the Paris Agreement goals is looking increasingly unlikely, with the urgent need to halve global emissions by the end of this decade. Yet, we're witnessing a new scramble for fossil fuels across Africa, sparked by Russia's war in Ukraine. In the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), oil blocks are overlapping with protected areas such as Virunga National Park and carbon-rich peatlands, putting biodiversity at risk and threatening human rights without proper community consultation.

Africa's oil comes with high carbon intensity, which only worsens climate injustice for vulnerable communities in the Global South already grappling with floods and droughts. The International Energy Agency (IEA) has made it clear: there should be no new investments in fossil fuels.

It's time for insurers to step up by ending their support for these projects, divesting from them, and prioritizing human rights. We've seen positive moves from companies like Munich Re and others in this direction, driven by both planetary imperatives and sound business sense.
