This week, Greenpeace activists around the world took to the streets and stores to protest retailers, from Colombia to Hong Kong, Canada to Switzerland. They demanded an end to single-use plastics and called for investment in refill and reuse systems, highlighting that there's no "away" for throwaway items.

The actions spanned demonstrations, in-store protests, and petition deliveries, all aimed at pushing for real change.

At the heart of this push is the Reuse Revolution, where people globally are replacing single-use plastics with reusables. More than 5 million individuals are urging companies and governments to take action against plastic pollution.

Companies are promoting false solutions such as paper or bioplastics and flawed recycling, which don't address the root problem.

Retailers need to step up by removing single-use plastics, committing to refill systems, and driving change alongside brands.

Join the #ReuseRevolution.
