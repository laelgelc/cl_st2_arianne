Greenpeace activists recently took a powerful stand in New York by delivering specially compiled books to major publishers. These books contained over 500,000 signatures and photos from communities around the world, all urging the publishers to stand up for free speech and the protection of the Canadian boreal forest.

The deliveries targeted key players in the industry, including Macmillan, Penguin Random House, Simon & Schuster, and HarperCollins. Through these books, we highlighted the need for these publishers to address their paper sourcing from Resolute Forest Products. Resolute continues to log intact forests, has lost its FSC certification on over 6 million hectares, and has pursued lawsuits against environmental advocates.

Responses from the publishers were mixed. Some chose to ignore our efforts or refused to meet with us. However, Hachette took a notable step by issuing an open letter that criticized Resolute's actions and demanded that the company make improvements.

At Greenpeace, we remain committed and vow to keep pushing forward on this critical issue.
