The Great Southern Reef stretches across 8,100 km of Australia's southern waters, creating a highly productive ecosystem. Its vast seaweed forests play a key role in capturing carbon while supporting hundreds of unique species, with 85% of them endemic to the area. This remarkable habitat even draws in Antarctic whales.

Despite its importance, the reef remains largely unexplored because of the harsh conditions in these waters. That's why Greenpeace's Rainbow Warrior has been conducting surveys, including groundbreaking first-time dives off Kangaroo Island. These efforts build on a recent study that identified 400 new marine species in the Great Australian Bight.

However, the reef faces serious threats from oil drilling, which carries the risk of spills that could devastate marine life, local industries, and communities. At a time when renewable alternatives are available, burning more oil only worsens climate change, making the industry increasingly outdated.

We need to spread the word and urge the Australian Government to protect this vital ecosystem.
