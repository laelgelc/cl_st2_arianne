A Honduran court has convicted seven men, including a military official, assassins, and employees of the company DESA, for the 2016 murder of Indigenous activist Berta Cáceres. Berta had been a vocal opponent of the Agua Zarca megadam project. Despite this verdict, the trial was marred by significant barriers, such as a lack of transparency and the exclusion of her family from the proceedings. Berta's daughter, Laura, has publicly decried the injustice and vowed to continue the fight.

This tragic killing is part of a broader global pattern of violence against those protecting the environment. In 2017 alone, 207 environmental defenders were murdered, with many of them being Indigenous women. We must demand justice not only for those convicted but also for the masterminds behind such crimes, while pushing for stronger protections for all defenders. Please share this message with #JusticeForBerta to amplify the call.
