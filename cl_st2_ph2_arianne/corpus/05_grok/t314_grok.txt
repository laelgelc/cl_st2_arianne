Victor Pickering, a Fijian activist, is aboard Greenpeace's Rainbow Warrior, witnessing deep sea mining tests in the Pacific's Clarion Clipperton Zone. Companies like GSR have lost equipment there and aim to exploit the ocean depths, despite warnings of irreversible ecosystem damage that could last for millennia.

He highlights the ocean crises, including sea level rise, depleted fish stocks, and plastic pollution, which are affecting Pacific communities. These communities view the sea as their identity and lifeline.

Resistance is growing among islands like Fiji and Vanuatu, pushing for a ban on deep sea mining.

Pickering calls for solidarity and a Global Ocean Treaty to protect 30% of the oceans by 2030, urging a shift from exploitation to protection. Greenpeace supports a worldwide ban on deep sea mining.
