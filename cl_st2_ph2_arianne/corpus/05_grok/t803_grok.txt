As the world grapples with the escalating impacts of climate change, from devastating floods to intense heatwaves, the message is clear: we can't afford inaction. Extreme weather events are on the rise, demanding urgent steps to curb emissions and shift to cleaner energy sources.

Yet, Samsung Electronics, one of the largest tech giants, continues to power its operations predominantly with dirty energy like coal. Despite its enormous scale—producing 400 million smartphones in 2016 alone, supplying components to companies like Apple and Tesla, and raking in $10 billion in profit—the company uses only 1% renewable energy in its production processes.

Meanwhile, competitors like Apple have made the switch to 100% renewables, proving it's possible for industry leaders to align with a sustainable future. Samsung, with its inspiring slogans, has the opportunity and responsibility to do the same by committing to renewable energy.

It's time for Samsung to stop fueling climate change. Join us in pressuring the company to make the switch—your voice can drive the change we need.
