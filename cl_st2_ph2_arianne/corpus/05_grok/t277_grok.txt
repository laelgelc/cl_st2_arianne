The latest IPCC report paints a stark picture of our intensifying climate crisis, with recent wildfires, floods, and heatwaves serving as undeniable evidence. These events underscore the urgent need for action to address the escalating impacts.

Photography plays a crucial role in raising awareness about this crisis, but it must do so without simply shocking audiences. Instead, the focus is on creating engaging and honest images that spark conversations and evoke genuine emotion.

Photographers are sharing their personal narratives to illustrate these changes. One example highlights the shrinkage of Lake Urmia, while another addresses environmental threats in Sri Lanka. Stories from Arctic scientific work also bring attention to the realities on the ground.

These efforts come amid shifts in media attention, pointing to the importance of balanced depictions that convey both urgency and hope.

The EverydayClimateChange project is expanding its reach through exhibitions and YouTube, broadening its impact.

At Greenpeace, we emphasize the power of bearing witness to these changes as a way to drive meaningful action.
