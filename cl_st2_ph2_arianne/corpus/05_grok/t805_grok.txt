In a world driven by hyperconsumption, MAKE SMTHNG Week is calling for action to challenge the excessive buying habits that harm our planet. This initiative shines a light on how overbuying in areas like food, fashion, and technology fuels climate change, destroys forests, and pollutes oceans.

One major issue it addresses is the waste generated by planned obsolescence, where products are designed to break down quickly. For instance, we now buy twice as many clothes as before and wear them for only half as long, and repairing items often costs more than simply replacing them.

Instead, MAKE SMTHNG Week encourages a shift toward a culture that truly values resources. This means embracing practices like repairing and upcycling items, choosing vegan alternatives, and steering clear of single-use plastics.

From November 23 to December 2, 2018, people around the world can join in through global events that bring together DIY enthusiasts, Greenpeace, and our partners for collaborative activities.
