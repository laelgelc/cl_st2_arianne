The world is facing a triple crisis: public health, economic, and ecological challenges that demand just solutions. One key step is unconditional international debt cancellation for the global south, which would enable post-COVID recovery.

This approach would free up resources to build a just, green future, including zero deforestation, no expansion of fossil fuels or minerals, ecosystem restoration, and learning from the ways of Indigenous Peoples.

Heavy debt burdens push countries toward extractivist models that cause environmental destruction. For instance, Argentina is facing the potential default on a $65 billion debt.

At Greenpeace, we call for immediate debt cancellation and non-debt-creating emergency finance. These measures would allow nations to prioritize health, wellbeing, and a sustainable economic model.
