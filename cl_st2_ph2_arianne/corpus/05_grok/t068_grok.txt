Twitter has become a powerful platform for people around the world to express their concerns about the climate crisis. However, it's not without its challenges, including information overload and the rise of climate disinformation, such as tweets claiming the climate crisis is a "scam."

In 2022, some of our favorite climate tweets captured the shared experiences that remind us we're not alone. These tweets reflect feelings of being overwhelmed by extreme weather events, unheard in our advocacy efforts, or anxious about what the future holds.

Despite these challenges, we must not give up the fight. We urge global leaders to take decisive action now. We also acknowledge the vulnerable nations like Pakistan, Bangladesh, and countries across Africa that are bearing the brunt of the crisis, even though they contribute the least to global emissions.

At the heart of it all, we value our planet far more than fossil fuel profits. We extend our thanks to the climate experts who tirelessly counter denialism and provide the facts we need.

Above all, we hold onto hope, as it inspires us to push for better actions and a sustainable future.
