The 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster remains a persistent threat, as long-lived radionuclides continue to circulate in the environment. Starting on April 3, 2020, wildfires in the exclusion zone have become the largest ever recorded there, scorching 57,000 hectares, which accounts for 22% of the area's total land. These fires are releasing radioactive particles, including caesium-137, strontium-90, americium-241, and various plutonium isotopes, into the atmosphere.

The resulting smoke has spread to locations such as Kyiv and even as far as Norway, leading to elevated radiation levels in those areas. This dispersion heightens health risks for people, particularly the potential for cancer due to inhalation of these contaminants.

Beyond the immediate radiation concerns, these wildfires are intensifying the broader nuclear threats in the region. They are also placing additional strain on emergency services, which are already stretched thin by the ongoing COVID-19 crisis. Furthermore, the situation underscores persistent issues with transparency regarding the disaster's aftermath.

Millions of people living in contaminated regions across Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia continue to be affected by these ongoing challenges.
