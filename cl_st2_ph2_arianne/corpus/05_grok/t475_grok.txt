A recent Greenpeace East Asia report has uncovered disturbing connections between Fong Chun Formosa (FCF), one of the world's top tuna traders based in Taiwan with an annual revenue of $45 billion, and serious abuses in the seafood industry. The report links FCF to forced labor involving migrant workers, illegal fishing practices, shark finning, and transshipment at sea.

At the heart of these issues is Taiwan's two-tiered labor system, which leaves vulnerable Southeast Asian fishers without essential protections, paving the way for exploitation.

To address these problems, it's crucial for Taiwan to eliminate this discriminatory system, ratify relevant International Labour Organization (ILO) conventions, improve vessel inspections, and establish effective grievance mechanisms for workers.

FCF must take responsibility by publicly disclosing its suppliers, halting transshipment practices, implementing comprehensive monitoring on vessels, and strengthening its human rights policies.

As consumers, we can play a part by cutting back on seafood consumption and choosing to support local, sustainable fisheries, helping to push back against these widespread industry abuses.
