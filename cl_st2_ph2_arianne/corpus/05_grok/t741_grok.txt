I moved to Australia from a landlocked country at the age of 13, and ever since, I've been captivated by the ocean's mysteries. In the Great Australian Bight, I've witnessed incredible natural wonders that deserve our protection.

At Point Labatt Lookout, I watched endangered Australian sea lion pups as they played and learned in their coastal habitat. These young sea lions rely on fragile breeding sites that are highly sensitive to disturbances, making any intrusion a serious risk to their survival.

Among the underwater marvels, leafy sea dragons stand out, masterfully camouflaged in seagrass meadows. Yet, these unique creatures are endangered by pollution, which threatens their delicate existence.

On land, the ancient granite formations known as Murphy’s Haystacks add to the region's timeless beauty, shaped by nature over millennia.

As an ocean photographer, I've documented these treasures through my explorations, capturing images that reveal the Bight's vibrant life. But this paradise faces grave threats from oil drilling and seismic blasts proposed by Statoil. Such activities could severely harm marine life that depends on sound for survival, including dolphins and cuttlefish, disrupting their essential behaviors and ecosystems.
