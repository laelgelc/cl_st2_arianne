Earth's biodiversity is collapsing under immense human pressures, a crisis on par with the mass extinctions that have reshaped our planet in the past. This loss threatens the very foundation of life as we know it, given nature's essential roles in providing us with food, clean air, and fresh water; regulating climate and nutrient cycles; protecting against diseases; nourishing our spirits; and enabling breakthroughs in medicine.

At the heart of this destruction lies extractive capitalism and industries like fossil fuels and industrial farming, which ravage ecosystems without regard for the consequences. Governments, too, bear responsibility, often prioritizing short-term profits over meaningful solutions to the biodiversity crisis.

It's time to rethink our systems of production and consumption entirely. We must commit to protecting at least 30% of the world's lands and oceans by 2030, working in partnership with Indigenous communities who have long stewarded these vital areas. Ambitious global agreements, such as those at the CBD COP15, offer a pathway to restore balance and build resilience for future generations.
