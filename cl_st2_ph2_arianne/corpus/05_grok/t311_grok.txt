Indigenous Land Defenders in the Amazon are facing increasing threats to their lives and homes as they work to protect vital ecosystems. At Greenpeace, we support Indigenous rights around the world and demand an end to the profit-driven destruction that fuels these dangers.

On May 26, illegal gold miners, emboldened by Brazil's Bolsonaro administration, launched an attack on a Munduruku village. They used gunfire and arson, burning the home of leader Maria Leusa.

This incident is part of a pattern of ongoing violence. In March, an Indigenous women's association headquarters was destroyed, and there have been attacks on Yanomami people.

From 2008 to 2020, miners destroyed over 61 km² of Munduruku land, with 63% of that destruction happening in 2019-2020.
