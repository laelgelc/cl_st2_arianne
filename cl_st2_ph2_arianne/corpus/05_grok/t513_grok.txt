I was riding Vancouver's SkyTrain the other day when I spotted an ad promoting family planning as a key climate solution. It got me thinking about the bigger picture, especially in light of Vaclav Smil's book "Growth," which argues that endless economic growth is fundamentally at odds with the limits of our biosphere. This conflict is made worse by the rebound effect, where improvements in efficiency actually lead to increased resource consumption overall.

At the heart of crises like climate change and biodiversity loss is the issue of human scale—our sheer numbers and demands on the planet. To truly address this, we need to put an end to perpetual growth. That means reducing waste, downsizing our lifestyles, and tackling population growth by advancing women's rights and access to contraception.

The post also takes aim at the myths of "green growth," which promise sustainability without real change. Instead, we must push for systemic shifts to break free from ecological overshoot.
