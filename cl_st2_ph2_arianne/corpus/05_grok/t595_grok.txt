In May, Israel experienced over 1000 wildfires during record-breaking heat that reached up to 45°C. These fires, attributed to climate change, forced evacuations and resulted in the loss of homes.

Climate breakdown is making wildfires more intense by driving higher temperatures, more frequent heat waves, and drier conditions. The Middle East has already warmed by 1.5°C, which is 50% above the global average.

A study highlights that by the end of the century, summers could become longer and winters shorter, leading to increased droughts and higher wildfire risks.

Greenpeace is calling for an immediate halt to fossil fuel prospecting in the Mediterranean and a shift to renewable energy sources.

To help prevent wildfires, it's essential to extinguish cigarettes and fires properly, avoid leaving flames unattended, and report any wildfires promptly.

For safety, evacuate immediately in the case of forest fires, smother grass fires if possible, and warn neighbors about the danger.
