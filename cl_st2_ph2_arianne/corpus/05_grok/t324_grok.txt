The Karipuna Indigenous Peoples are fighting to protect their officially recognized Brazilian territory from land-grabbers who are invading for logging and cattle farming. They have spoken at the UN, collaborated with organizations to monitor deforestation, and highlighted government inaction. Now, they are suing the Brazilian state for permitting illegal land registrations via the misused CAR registry, which enables deforestation and grazing in protected areas. This issue, combined with no protection plan, ranked their land among Brazil's top 10 most destroyed Indigenous territories last year. Deforestation has surged under President Bolsonaro's anti-environmental policies since 2019, threatening Indigenous lives and ecosystems. Supporting their rights is crucial for global climate protection.
