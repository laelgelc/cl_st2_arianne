As the end of the year approaches, consumption spikes dramatically during events like Black Friday, Singles Day, and Cyber Monday. These surges are fueled by low prices that fail to account for the true environmental costs involved.

Today, 55% of the world's population lives in cities, a figure projected to rise to 70% by 2050. This urban concentration means that consumption in cities is responsible for 70% of global greenhouse gas emissions.

In the midst of recovery from COVID-19, governments are actively promoting consumerism, which has led to a significant boost in e-commerce.

It's time to shift toward consuming less and better. This involves carefully analyzing purchases to minimize the high-carbon impacts associated with production, shipping, and packaging.

Cities can take meaningful action by banning certain advertisements, promoting repair cafes, encouraging reuse, and fostering sharing initiatives. At the same time, e-commerce platforms must be held accountable for adopting sustainable practices.
