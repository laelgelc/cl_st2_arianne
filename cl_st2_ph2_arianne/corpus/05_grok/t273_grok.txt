Fossil fuel companies are increasingly relying on soft power tactics, such as sponsorships and strategic influence, to greenwash their images and protect their business models that continue to harm the climate. By associating themselves with popular cultural, educational, and sporting events, these corporations attempt to distract from their environmental impact and maintain public support.

Take the world of rugby, for instance, where companies like Ineos and Total have stepped in as sponsors for major events. This allows them to polish their reputations while their core operations contribute to climate damage. Similarly, Shell has funded museum exhibitions, but with clauses that prevent any criticism of the company, effectively silencing potential scrutiny. ExxonMobil has also poured money into the arts, all while publicly denying the science of climate change.

The influence extends into education as well. Total has exerted sway at institutions like École Polytechnique, shaping curricula and research in ways that align with industry interests. Oil companies have sponsored programs in schools, targeting young minds to normalize their presence. In sports, Gazprom's partnership with UEFA exemplifies how fossil fuel giants embed themselves in global events to enhance their visibility and legitimacy.

It's time to put an end to fossil fuel advertising and sponsorships. Banning these practices would help accelerate the transition to a greener future. We're already seeing positive shifts, with growing divestment from fossil fuels and increasing reluctance among young people to engage with these industries.
