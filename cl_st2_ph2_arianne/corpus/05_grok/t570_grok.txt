Greenpeace activists aboard our ship Esperanza staged a powerful protest at the International Seabed Authority's (ISA) 25th Assembly in Jamaica. We were there to spotlight the ISA's glaring failure to protect the deep oceans from destructive mining activities.

Here are four key reasons why the ISA is falling short:

First, the ISA is obsessed with exploitation over protection, and it lacks the capacity to address environmental stresses.

Second, it ignores concerns by prioritizing company-led, non-independent environmental impact assessments.

Third, it favors mining companies, never denying licenses and allowing cozy industry ties.

Fourth, it undermines a strong Global Ocean Treaty by lobbying for weaker governance.

That's why we're urging everyone to sign our petition for ocean sanctuaries that prioritize protection. Join us in this fight—your signature can make a difference.
