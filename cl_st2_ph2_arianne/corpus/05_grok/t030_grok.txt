In the heart of Egypt's Sinai region, the Sinaweya project stands as a beacon of hope for preserving both ecological and cultural heritage. Founded by Dina Kafafi in 2017, this social enterprise focuses on St. Catherine, a UNESCO site facing threats from tourism development and climate change.

Sinaweya works closely with the local Bedouin Jabaliya tribe, honoring their ancestral knowledge in horticulture, herbalism, and crafts. Through this collaboration, the project empowers communities by rehabilitating gardens, creating a herbal database, and launching the be.do brand.

These efforts foster economic opportunities, self-sufficiency, and a deeper commitment to environmental care. As a result, locals—including women embroiderers and young gardeners—are able to sustain their livelihoods while reviving traditional practices that have been passed down through generations.
