In the vast expanse of the Indian Ocean, a remarkable subspecies of blue whale thrives in tropical waters: the pygmy blue whale. These majestic creatures are smaller and lighter than their Antarctic counterparts, adapted to their unique environment.

Commercial whaling once decimated whale populations worldwide, pushing many to the brink of extinction. This devastation has only recently allowed scientists to uncover hidden subspecies like the pygmy blue whale, revealing just how vulnerable they are due to their specialized habitats.

Today, these whales face a barrage of modern threats, including ocean noise, ship strikes, habitat destruction, and the impacts of climate change. Yet, whales are vital to healthy ecosystems and play a crucial role in combating climate change itself.

To safeguard them, we need global ocean sanctuaries that provide comprehensive protection. The 1986 international ban on commercial whaling marked a turning point, but more action is essential. Greenpeace's Arctic Sunrise expedition has highlighted these urgent needs, and we urge everyone to join us in supporting these efforts for the future of our oceans.
