Valencia is leading the way in Spain with an inspiring commitment to expand organic farming. The region plans to double its organic farmland from 8% to 20% by 2020, supported by a substantial investment of 23 million Euros. This move comes at a critical time, as Spain grapples with an ongoing economic crisis and faces the damaging effects of high pesticide use, which is severely harming bee populations.

We're seeing a positive shift globally, with increasing demand for ecological food driving change. Farmers are moving away from industrial farming systems, embracing more sustainable practices. This is part of a growing movement that includes vibrant ecological markets and cooperative initiatives, fostering a healthier food system.

As advocates for the environment, we urge governments to invest in ecological agriculture. Such investments can help tackle pressing issues like climate change, pollution, biodiversity loss, and even hunger. It's time for individuals to join in too—pledge your support for better, more sustainable food today.
