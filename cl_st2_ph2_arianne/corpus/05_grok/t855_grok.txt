In the heart of the North Pacific, our ship Esperanza is sailing as part of Greenpeace's Ocean Defenders Campaign, documenting the devastating impact of plastic pollution in the infamous garbage patch. We've spotted everyday items like toothbrushes washing up on places like Kahuku beach, a stark reminder of how far this crisis reaches.

Plastic endures for over 500 years, and every piece ever produced still exists somewhere on our planet. In the oceans, this waste has accumulated into debris fields larger than France, posing severe threats to wildlife. Birds, for instance, are incorporating plastic into their nests, mistaking it for natural materials.

The damage from plastic spans its entire lifecycle, starting with fossil fuel extraction and extending to the release of toxins and the harm inflicted on sea life.

This material originated in the 19th century as a substitute for ivory in items like billiard balls. Its production scaled up with mass manufacturing techniques and accelerated during World War II, paving the way for a massive consumer boom in the postwar era.

To combat this, we can all take steps to reduce plastic use, such as switching to reusable bags and steering clear of products containing microbeads.
