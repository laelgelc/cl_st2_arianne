The Covid-19 pandemic has underscored the essential role that urban green and public spaces play in supporting health and well-being. These areas provided much-needed relief from stress and opportunities to reconnect with nature during challenging times.

Access to such spaces offers a range of benefits, including enhanced brain development and cognitive function in children. They also help reduce risks of non-communicable diseases, such as cardiovascular conditions and diabetes. Additionally, green spaces contribute to lower mortality rates associated with pollution and inactivity, improved pregnancy outcomes, better perceived general health, and shorter hospitalization times.

Beyond physical health, green spaces bolster mental health by helping to lower stress, depression, and anxiety. Urban civic spaces deliver similar advantages, enhancing overall well-being in city environments.

To promote accessible greenery, the 3-30-300 Rule serves as a guideline for combating climate change and biodiversity loss. There are growing calls for authorities to prioritize equitable urban greening to ensure these benefits reach everyone.
