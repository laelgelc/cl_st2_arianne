World Photography Day, celebrated on August 19, reminds us of the power of images to capture moments that can change the world. As the legendary war photographer Robert Capa once advised, "If your pictures aren't good enough, you're not close enough." This wisdom resonates deeply in our work at Greenpeace, where getting close to the issues—literally and figuratively—helps us tell stories that drive environmental action.

I'm Sudhanshu Malhotra, Greenpeace International's Multimedia Editor based in Hong Kong. Photography is profound in its ability to be both deeply personal and publicly shared. Its origins trace back to the 19th century, when it began bearing witness to the world through landscapes and portraits. Over the past 200 years, images have been used as evidence in courts and have inspired people to take action.

Photography has long been an ally to environmental movements, communicating across languages and cultures in ways words sometimes cannot. At Greenpeace, we've harnessed this power through our campaigns. Here are 12 iconic images from our archives that highlight the urgency of protecting our planet:

- A turtle entangled in plastic waste, illustrating the devastating impact of ocean pollution.

- A bloodied whale, an image that helped prompt international whaling bans.

- Pelicans soaked in oil, capturing the horror of oil spills.

- Vast areas of deforestation in Indonesia, exposing the destruction of vital rainforests.

- Protesters at Standing Rock, standing against pipelines threatening indigenous lands and water.

- A woman celebrating victory against a coal company, symbolizing community triumphs over fossil fuels.

These images, among others in our collection, show the real faces of environmental crises and the hope in fighting back. On this World Photography Day, we invite you to join the movement—whether by sharing your own photos, supporting our campaigns, or taking action to protect the planet. Together, we can create a future worth capturing.
