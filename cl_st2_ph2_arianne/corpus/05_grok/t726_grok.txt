World Meat Free Week is here, running from June 11 to 17, and it's a global call to action for everyone to embrace plant-based meals and contribute to a healthier planet. This initiative highlights how intensive meat and dairy production is fueling deforestation, with over a quarter of Earth's land dedicated to grazing. These practices match the emissions from the entire transport sector in terms of global warming impact, and they stand as the biggest consumers and polluters of water worldwide.

Beyond the environmental toll, high consumption of red meat is connected to serious health risks, including cancer, heart disease, obesity, and diabetes. Shifting to plant-based diets could prevent up to five million deaths by 2050.

You can get involved right away by incorporating more vegetables into your meals, organizing potlucks with friends and family, and exploring Greenpeace's cookbook and toolkit for inspiration and resources. Around the world, cities are stepping up too—places like those in Mexico and Denmark are actively promoting vegetarian options in public institutions to support this shift. Join the movement this week and help build a sustainable future!
