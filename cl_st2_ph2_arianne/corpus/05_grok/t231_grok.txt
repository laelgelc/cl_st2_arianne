Illegal mining in the Amazon is putting the health and livelihoods of local communities at serious risk. Rumors of gold discoveries in the Madeira River have attracted hundreds of mining rafts to the area near Autazes. On November 23, Greenpeace Brazil documented this illegal activity, observing that the miners receive support from businessmen and politicians in locations such as Humaitá. The mining operations are contaminating rivers with mercury, posing a direct threat to the environment and people who depend on these waterways.

Authorities like Ibama and Ipaam have been aware of the issue, but they are dealing with resource cuts under the Bolsonaro administration. Following mounting pressure, an operation on November 28 resulted in the destruction of 70 rafts and the arrest of 10 miners. However, a public announcement by Vice-President Mourão prior to the action allowed many to escape.

According to data from MapBiomas, mining areas in Brazil have sextupled between 1985 and 2020, with the majority of this expansion occurring in the Amazon region. There has been a particular surge in Indigenous lands and conservation units. Amid the ongoing climate crisis, the government is showing a lack of will to protect the forest.
