The Brazilian Amazon is home to an incredibly rich biodiversity, but this treasure is under severe threat from illegal gold mining. These operations are destroying the ecosystem by polluting rivers with mercury and sediments. This pollution reduces sunlight penetration in the water, disrupting how fish hunt and respire, and it also impacts fish spawning in the headwaters. The use of excavators in these mining activities is accelerating the damage.

In 2022, a Greenpeace expedition ventured into previously unstudied areas of the Amazon, shedding light on unknown species and the crucial role of soil microorganisms. These microorganisms are vital for advancements in medicine and agriculture.

The expansion of illegal mining is facilitated by around 320 airstrips built on Indigenous lands, which involve clearing vast areas of vegetation. Additionally, miners are hunting local animals such as monkeys and capybaras, which compromises essential ecological processes like seed dispersal and pollination. This hunting also creates competition with Indigenous Peoples for food resources.

Given these devastating impacts, there is an urgent need for a new development model that preserves the forest and its biodiversity.
