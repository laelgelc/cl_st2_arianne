In 1996, Greenpeace founders including Dorothy Stowe, Jim Bohlen, Bob Hunter, and Dorothy Metcalfe came together in Vancouver to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the organization's launch in 1971. During the gathering, they shared stories of Greenpeace's beginnings, tracing its roots to the "Don't Make a Wave Committee," which formed to protest U.S. nuclear tests on Amchitka Island.

They recalled the inaugural voyage aboard the Phyllis Cormack, a fishing boat that was renamed Greenpeace for the mission. Funding for this early effort came from donations and benefit concerts, helping to mobilize support. The group emphasized their media strategies, which played a key role in drawing global attention to the cause.

Central to their accounts were Greenpeace's commitment to non-violent direct actions, which proved effective in challenging environmental threats. Among the successes they highlighted were halting the nuclear tests and contributing to the establishment of a nature reserve on Amchitka.

The founders also touched on internal conflicts that arose as the organization grew, reflecting the challenges of building a movement. Over time, these experiences helped shape Greenpeace into an international environmental force, expanding its reach and impact far beyond those initial protests.
