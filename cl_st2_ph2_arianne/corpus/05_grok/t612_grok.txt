In April 2019, Greenpeace activists around the world took a stand against Nestlé's heavy reliance on single-use plastics. We delivered symbolic "plastic monsters" crafted from the company's own waste directly to its offices and factories, drawing attention to the urgent need for change.

The actions kicked off with activists crashing the Nestlé Annual General Meeting on April 11. Then, on April 16, protests unfolded in Kenya, Italy, Switzerland, Slovenia, the US, Canada, and Poland. The momentum continued on April 22 with demonstrations in Malaysia and Mexico.

One particularly striking element was a massive plastic monster that traveled from the Netherlands to Switzerland along the Rhine River.

These protests spotlighted Nestlé's production of 1.7 million tonnes of plastic packaging in 2018 alone. Through these efforts, we called on the company to shift investments toward refill and reuse systems as part of the #BreakFreeFromPlastic movement.
