Imagine governments around the world sitting down to receive their exam results on biodiversity protection. The targets set back in 2010? A resounding failure. Not a single one was fully achieved, and now nature is teetering on the brink of collapse.

Destructive industries are largely to blame, with fossil fuels and industrial agriculture ramping up the pressure on our planet. Today, just 15% of forests remain intact, and only 3% of oceans are untouched by human activity.

This mess is compounded by political pollution from corporations, influencing decisions that favor profits over the planet.

It's time for urgent change. We must end subsidies to these harmful sectors, transform how we produce food, establish vast ocean sanctuaries, and ensure recovery packages are green and just.

Governments need to deliver accountable national plans backed by proper funding. And we all have a role: mobilize the public to demand action, protect nature, and tackle the intertwined crises we're facing.
