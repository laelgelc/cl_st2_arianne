Air pollution is a global crisis, with toxic air choking cities far beyond just Beijing and Delhi. Many urban areas are exceeding safe pollution levels, and a major culprit is fossil fuel vehicles. To mark the EU’s Green Week, Greenpeace volunteers took to the streets across Europe, demanding real change through creative actions.

In Berlin, volunteers highlighted how cars dominate 60% of street space, while cyclists get only 3%. In Paris, activists braved the rain to cheer on cyclists. Rome saw campaigners unfurl a banner calling on politician Nicola Zingaretti to tackle toxic air. Moscow’s cyclists joined forces with Let’s Bike It to raise awareness about health impacts. And in Belgium, protests featured banners, bike-powered events, and flashmobs.

Greenpeace will keep up the pressure on governments and car companies, and we invite everyone to sign up and join the fight.
