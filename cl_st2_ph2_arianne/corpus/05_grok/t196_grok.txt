In the midst of the fastest-growing refugee crisis since World War II, Greenpeace organizations in neighboring countries such as Slovakia and Romania are stepping up to support Ukrainian refugees. They are providing essential supplies, tents, food, and other aid to those fleeing the conflict.

This war is deeply connected to our global dependence on fossil fuels. By transitioning to renewable energy sources, we can foster both peace and sustainability.

Greenpeace activists have taken non-violent actions to protest Russian oil and gas imports in countries including Germany, Spain, France, and others. These efforts are part of broader global peaceful protests opposing the invasion.

Such actions reflect Greenpeace's 50-year history of combining peace and ecology in the fight against war and militarism.
