Out in the vast expanse of the Indian Ocean, Greenpeace's ship Esperanza is making waves in the fight against destructive fishing. Armed with its impressive reach and cutting-edge technology—like solar-powered UAVs, an underwater ROV, and powerful binoculars—the crew is actively locating and removing dozens of Fish Aggregating Devices (FADs). These efforts are crucial in preventing the tragic bycatch deaths caused by reckless fishing vessels that supply Thai Union.

Once retrieved, the FAD components aren't just discarded; they're given back to local artisanal fishermen or cleverly repurposed into solar-powered lamps and chargers. Through these actions, we're directly challenging Thai Union's harmful practices right at sea, and we're not stopping there—more efforts are planned on land to keep pushing for change.
