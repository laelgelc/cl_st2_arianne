Greenpeace is celebrating Pride month by waving our rainbow emblem of hope and diversity, honoring our LGBTQ+ crews and supporters. We're highlighting queer diversity in ocean creatures, noting that human concepts like sexuality apply loosely to animals, where prejudice is absent. Examples include young male orcas engaging in male-on-male sex; bisexual seahorses with males giving birth; female albatross pairs raising young; hermaphroditic starfish and sea urchins; wrasses that change from female to male; and clownfish that shift from male to female. This emphasizes our shared complexity with marine wildlife and much more to discover.
