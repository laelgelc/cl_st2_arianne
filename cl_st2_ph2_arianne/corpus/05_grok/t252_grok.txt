In the Amazon, the natural mist that rises from the lush rainforest is a breathtaking sight, a gentle veil that nourishes the ecosystem. But increasingly, this mist is overshadowed by thick, harmful smoke from fires linked to deforestation, posing a stark and dangerous contrast.

These fires are not just destroying forests—they're severely impacting human health. According to a 2020 report, smoke from these fires led to 2,195 hospitalizations for respiratory diseases in 2019 alone, with an economic cost of BRL 5.64 million. Hospitalizations peaked during the fire season, underscoring the direct link between the blazes and public health crises.

The smoke worsens existing conditions like asthma and has been shown to increase the severity of COVID-19, as observed in the state of Rondônia. Air quality in affected areas frequently surpasses World Health Organization limits, making the environment hazardous for breathing.

Children and the elderly are hit hardest by these effects, facing heightened risks from the polluted air. Beyond health, the fires drive climate emissions and accelerate biodiversity loss in the Amazon.

It's crucial for governments to take action to protect the forest, safeguarding not only the environment but also public health for communities across the region.
