Indigenous Peoples from Brazil gather annually at the Free Land Camp in Brasília to share knowledge, support each other, and demand government protection of their rights. This year feels bittersweet under President Bolsonaro's administration, which has weakened environmental tools and failed to shield Indigenous communities from violence, threats, and land invasions by industries. They hold constitutional rights to traditional lands and have long fought to protect them. Global activists demonstrated at Brazilian embassies with banners, music, and speeches, urging solidarity with forest guardians to save the Amazon. Deforestation has risen since 2012, clearing two soccer fields per minute, threatening livelihoods and exacerbating climate breakdown like hurricanes and heat waves. Indigenous lands best protect forests, but the government proposes halting recognition to open them for mining, logging, and agriculture. Join the movement to support them.
