The Amazon Reef is a vital and diverse ecosystem located between Brazil and French Guiana. This unique reef extends to depths of up to 200 meters. In 2018, it was the site of a victory achieved by 2 million people who stood against oil giant Total.

Now, the reef faces a new threat from BP, which has been pushing to drill in the area since 2016. Potential oil spills from such drilling could devastate regions beyond Brazil, including mangroves, the reef itself, and species like whales and turtles. These activities would also exacerbate the climate crisis.

Governments now have an opportunity to adopt a strong Global Ocean Treaty that could provide protection for areas like this.

Greenpeace's Pole to Pole expedition will spend five weeks documenting the area to highlight its importance and urge action against oil companies.
