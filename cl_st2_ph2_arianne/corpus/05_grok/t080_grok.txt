The concept of "Nature Positive" is being promoted as a solution to biodiversity loss, but it's fundamentally vague and prioritizes a failed economic model over genuine protection of biodiversity. At its core, it allows for net gains to be claimed by offsetting environmental destruction in one area through restoration efforts elsewhere, which undermines real conservation.

Proponents of "Nature Positive" have set ambitious targets: achieving zero net loss starting from 2020, reaching net positives by 2030, and aiming for full recovery by 2050. However, these goals are unscientific and rely on indicators such as carbon storage and habitat extent, which lack credibility and fail to account for the full complexity of biodiversity.

This agenda pushes for the financialization and trading of nature, opening the door to greenwashing by industries that can continue harmful practices under the guise of sustainability.

Governments must reject the inclusion of "Nature Positive" in COP15 agreements. Instead, they should advance conservation policies that recognize Indigenous rights and focus on curbing destruction at its source.
