Greenpeace is thrilled to celebrate LEGO's decision to end its long-standing contract with Shell. This victory comes after a powerful three-month campaign, supported by over one million people from around the world who emailed LEGO demanding it sever ties with the oil giant.

The outcome shines a light on Shell's attempts to burnish its reputation by partnering with popular brands like LEGO, even as it faces widespread opposition to its Arctic drilling plans.

Throughout the campaign, several standout moments captured global attention. A viral video amassed nearly six million views, highlighting the issues at stake. Children took part by building LEGO Arctic animals in a protest outside Shell's London headquarters. Miniature LEGO figures staged "LEGOlution" protests worldwide, amplifying the message. Activists even executed a bold LEGO climber action at a Shell station within Legoland. All of this was fueled by an enormous public outcry.

As Arctic sea ice reaches record lows, Greenpeace calls on Shell to drop its Arctic ambitions once and for all.
