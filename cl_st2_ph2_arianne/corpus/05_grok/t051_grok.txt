Fossil fuel companies are destroying communities, polluting the environment, and profiting at the expense of vulnerable people. Unfair energy tariffs mean that low-income, low-usage customers are forced to pay higher per-unit prices, which only exacerbates poverty during the ongoing energy crisis. In Europe, high disconnection rates are leaving people without power. Prepayment meters in South Africa and Australia are leading to self-disconnections, where users simply can't afford to top up. And underheated homes are causing serious health issues for many.

These problems stem from fossil fuels, which contribute to pollution, climate disasters, and human rights violations. Meanwhile, companies like BP and Shell are reporting record profits.

It's time to phase out fossil fuels, transition to renewable energy, and pursue climate justice to put an end to these inequalities.
