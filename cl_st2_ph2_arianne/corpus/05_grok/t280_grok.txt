Irving and Dorothy Stowe were pacifists deeply influenced by Gandhi and Quaker ideals. They fled the US because of their opposition to the Vietnam War and nuclear testing, eventually settling in Vancouver. There, they organized anti-war and ecological campaigns, which led to the formation of the Don’t Make A Wave Committee. This group aimed to protest US nuclear tests on Amchitka Island.

Inspired by a suggestion to sail into the test zone, they raised funds through concerts and chartered the boat Phyllis Cormack, which they renamed Greenpeace. The 1971 voyage did not stop the blast from happening, but it galvanized global opposition. This widespread response ultimately led to the cancellation of the nuclear testing program and the founding of the Greenpeace Foundation.
