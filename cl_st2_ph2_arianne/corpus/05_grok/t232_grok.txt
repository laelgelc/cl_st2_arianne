I joined Greenpeace Africa in 2011, transitioning from my background in journalism in Cameroon. Starting as Communications Manager, I later advanced to Head of Communications. Over the years, we've achieved several key highlights in our campaigns.

One major effort was opposing nuclear expansion in South Africa, which contributed to the project's abandonment in 2019. We also exposed illegal fishing in West Africa using the Rainbow Warrior, leading to the revocation of several licenses. In Senegal, we launched a report on the impacts of overfishing, which influenced policy changes and shaped narratives around migration.

Additionally, we've protested coal dependence while promoting renewables and a Just Transition. During the COVID-19 period, I've reflected on our ongoing work to combat corruption and deforestation in the Congo Basin, all while persisting in efforts to change narratives for environmental justice.
