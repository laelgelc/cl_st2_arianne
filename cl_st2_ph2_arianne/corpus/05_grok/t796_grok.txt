Air pollution is a serious issue affecting our health and environment, but there are practical steps you can take to minimize your exposure. At Greenpeace, we recommend exercising outdoors during the early morning or evening hours when the air tends to be clearer. Opting for side streets instead of main roads can reduce your exposure by up to 60%. Spending time in local parks offers access to cleaner air while also providing mental health benefits.

When walking along busy roads, try to stay further from the curbs to limit contact with vehicle emissions. At traffic lights, it's wise to wait a few steps back to avoid the concentrated emissions, which is particularly important for children. At home, open windows that face away from busy roads to let in fresher air.

For the long term, transitioning to clean transport options like electric vehicles is crucial. Greenpeace is actively campaigning for this shift and calling on governments to take stronger action to reduce pollution overall.
