Japan is moving forward with plans to discharge more than 1.2 million tons of radioactive wastewater from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant into the Pacific Ocean, beginning in 2023. This decision comes despite international agreements, including the London Convention and its Protocol, which explicitly prohibit the dumping of nuclear waste at sea.

This stance marks a stark contrast to Japan's position in 1993, when the country actively opposed Russia's plans to dump radioactive waste into the ocean. Back then, Japan supported a global ban on such practices and even provided funding to help Russia build onshore waste processing facilities. These efforts were significantly influenced by Greenpeace campaigns that highlighted the dangers of ocean dumping.

At a recent meeting of the International Maritime Organization (IMO), Greenpeace put forward practical alternatives to ocean discharge, such as extended storage and advanced processing technologies. However, Japan, with support from the United States, France, and the United Kingdom, successfully blocked any meaningful discussion on these options. In contrast, countries like South Korea and several Pacific nations expressed support for a thorough review of the plans.

Japan's current approach, bolstered by backing from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), shows a troubling disregard for its legal obligations under international agreements and ignores the legitimate concerns raised by neighboring countries and communities in the region.
