As we mark Greenpeace's 50th anniversary, I've been reflecting on our journey through a series of virtual mailbag calls with supporters and activists. These conversations have brought back powerful stories from our history, like the 1981 "test blockade" where we stopped an oil tanker and ultimately prevented the construction of a proposed oil port. It's a reminder of how direct action can create real change.

To keep pushing forward, we need to embrace creative activism. This could mean boycotting climate conferences that fail to deliver results or painting projections of future sea-level rise directly onto buildings to make the crisis visible.

These efforts are especially urgent as we see pandemics connected to ecological overshoot, driven by unchecked human growth and consumption patterns. It's time for the environmental movement to confront tough issues like population dynamics, the flaws in capitalism, and the need for economic contraction to live within planetary limits.

Amid these challenges, I find hope in reconnecting with nature—it's a source of inspiration and resilience. Looking back, Greenpeace has evolved significantly over the decades, shaped by personal experiences from countless campaigns. What sustains these enduring movements is creativity, which keeps our work vibrant and effective.
