Greenpeace Argentina recently conducted an overflight that uncovered alarming evidence of illegal deforestation in Chaco province. Our team documented the clearing of 10,329 hectares between November 2020 and July 2021, even though the province had suspended such activities. We observed bulldozers actively operating in at least 10 different sites.

The Gran Chaco stands as South America's second-largest forest, a vital ecosystem that sustains a rich diversity of species and provides a home to around 4 million people. This includes Indigenous communities such as the Wichi and Qom, who rely on the forest for their sustenance and way of life.

This deforestation is primarily driven by the expansion of agriculture and livestock production aimed at export markets. Such activities are worsening the impacts of climate change, including more severe droughts and storms. They are also devastating biodiversity and undermining the livelihoods of Indigenous peoples.

We call for stronger enforcement of forest protection laws and greater collaboration with Indigenous knowledge and expertise. Together, we must stop the clearing and work towards restoring these precious ecosystems.
