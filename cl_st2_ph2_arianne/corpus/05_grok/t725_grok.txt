In the midst of escalating "trade wars," the real battles we should be fighting—against climate change and for global peace—are being sidelined. This distraction is pulling focus away from the urgent crises that threaten our planet and future.

It's time to reject the neoliberal trade model that erodes environmental protections and weakens policies designed to safeguard our world. Instead, we need a trade system that's transparent and just, one that fully respects UN agreements such as the Paris Accord, upholds human rights, and embeds sustainability at its core. This approach would prioritize equality and the well-being of future generations over short-term gains.

The current global trade regime is deeply flawed, driving inequality and causing severe environmental damage. Take the EU-Mercosur deal, often dubbed the "cows for cars" agreement, which boosts deforestation and greenhouse gas emissions by favoring agricultural exports in exchange for industrial goods.

Trade policies today are heavily influenced by corporate lobbies, putting protective laws at risk. These must be reformed to serve the public interest, ensuring that trade supports rather than undermines our collective efforts to combat climate change and build a sustainable future.
