Greenpeace is thrilled to celebrate a monumental victory achieved by dedicated activists, petitioners, and global supporters who compelled Shell to abandon its Arctic drilling plans. Through relentless protests, widespread petitions, and immense public pressure, this effort transformed what was once just a corporate agenda into major headlines, proving that people power can triumph over profits.

Shell's decision came after acknowledging the enormous high costs involved—over $7 billion already spent—along with insufficient oil discoveries, a tough regulatory environment shaped by worldwide opposition, and significant risks, including a 75% chance of oil spills.

The environmental dangers at stake are profound, encompassing the acceleration of Arctic melting, the displacement of communities, and harm to wildlife.

Yet, the fight is far from over. We must push forward for permanent protection of the Arctic against drilling by all oil companies.
