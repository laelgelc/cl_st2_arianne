Today marks International Human Rights Day on December 10th, leading up to the 70th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. This day serves as a reminder that climate change represents a profound human rights crisis, affecting billions around the world.

A recent study reveals that just 50 major investor-owned carbon producers are responsible for 16% of the global temperature rise and 11% of the sea level rise between 1880 and 2010. These impacts have led to devastating consequences, including extreme weather events that violate fundamental human rights.

In response, a national inquiry in the Philippines, launched by survivors of Typhoon Haiyan and backed by Greenpeace, is examining the accountability of these companies for human rights abuses linked to climate change. We urge these corporations to participate in the upcoming meeting scheduled for December 11th in Manila.

Amid a growing wave of legal actions worldwide, we call on the public to join us in demanding climate justice and a transition to 100% renewable energy. Your support can help hold these polluters accountable and protect human rights for future generations.
