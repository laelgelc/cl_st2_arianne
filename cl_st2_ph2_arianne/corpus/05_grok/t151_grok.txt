This summer in India, unbearable heat has gripped the region, with a Delhi roadside vendor describing it as the worst day this year. The heat disproportionately affects the poor, including daily wagers and vendors who bear the brunt of these conditions.

Climate change is worsening inequality around the world, as governments accept extreme weather as the new normal. World leaders must commit to ambitious climate and social equity actions to address this crisis.

Recent events underscore the urgency: India experienced a record-hot March heatwave accompanied by low rainfall. In Brazil, floods have killed 106 people. In Assam, India, 700,000 people have been affected by flooding. South Africa's KwaZulu-Natal province has seen deadly destruction from similar extreme weather.
