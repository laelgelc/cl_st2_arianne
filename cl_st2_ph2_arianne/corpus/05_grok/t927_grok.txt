Greenpeace's German office has ranked supermarket chains based on their Detox commitments, highlighting those lagging behind and those leading the way in eliminating harmful chemicals from textile supply chains.

Several chains have been labeled as "Detox Losers" for failing to commit to eliminating these harmful chemicals by 2020. This includes Rewe/Penny, Tchibo, Coop, Edeka/Netto, Norma, Metro/Real, Interspar, and Migros.

In contrast, Aldi and Lidl stand out as "Detox Trendsetters." They are banning toxics, publishing discharge data, and starting recycling programs.

Kaufland has now joined as the 33rd brand committing to detox by 2020, with efforts to increase durable and recyclable clothing.

These trendsetters are focusing on the full product lifecycle, incorporating take-back programs and fabric reuse to reduce environmental impact.

We urge consumers to return clothes to stores to help accelerate recycling efforts.
