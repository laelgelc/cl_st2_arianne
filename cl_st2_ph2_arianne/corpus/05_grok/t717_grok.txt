Israel's Energy Minister Yuval Steinitz has announced that the country will eliminate coal and oil use by 2030. This move promotes electric vehicles, gas-powered trucks, and electricity from gas and renewables.

At Greenpeace Israel, we've long campaigned against coal plants in Hadera and Ashkelon. Our efforts have highlighted their health, financial, and climate harms, including greenhouse gas emissions and premature deaths. Rather than installing scrubbers, we've pushed for shutdowns, securing commitments to close old units by 2022 and end coal imports.

We advocate for 100% renewables, emphasizing solar to meet Paris Agreement goals and protect future generations.
