The fossil fuel industry has been involved in unlawful activities for decades, including spreading lies about the climate crisis. A recent examination reveals 26 examples of credibly alleged or proven crimes committed by Europe-based companies such as Shell, TotalEnergies, and Equinor. Among these, corruption stands out as the most recurrent offense, with emerging instances of greenwashing also noted.

These activities have caused severe impacts, particularly in the Global South, including in countries like Nigeria and Sudan. The industry is responsible for driving one-third of global emissions, which are exacerbating climate disasters such as the floods in Pakistan and typhoons in the Philippines.

Greenpeace is calling for an immediate halt to new fossil fuel projects, greater accountability for those responsible, and the pursuit of climate justice to put an end to these crimes.
