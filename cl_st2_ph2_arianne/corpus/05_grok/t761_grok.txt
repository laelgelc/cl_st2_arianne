Imagine checking in not to your local coffee shop or a bustling city spot, but to the remote and breathtaking Weddell Sea in Antarctica. This simple act on Facebook can help spotlight the preciousness of this icy wilderness and underscore the urgent need for stronger protections in the Antarctic, as part of a growing global effort.

As a digital campaigner at Greenpeace, I'm Aakash Naik, and I'm inviting you to join thousands in this unique check-in to push for change. Unlike your everyday check-ins, this one draws attention to creating the world's largest ocean sanctuary right here this year. Such a sanctuary would safeguard vital species like penguins, whales, and seals from the threats posed by industrial fishing vessels that are depleting krill stocks near their colonies and feeding areas.

When masses of people check in, it sparks conversations and raises awareness about these critical issues. Here's how you can participate: Search for the Weddell Sea on Facebook, check in, add a comment about why Antarctic protection matters to you, and share the petition link at www.protecttheantarctic.org to amplify the call.
