The shipping industry is a massive contributor to climate-polluting emissions, producing levels equivalent to those of a top global emitter. Yet, these emissions have largely evaded strict regulations, thanks to intense lobbying and a lack of scrutiny.

That's why the upcoming April meeting of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) in London represents a critical opportunity. Here, member states can adopt a high-ambition plan to phase out shipping emissions by 2050. Greenpeace is working alongside other NGOs to advocate for this essential step forward.

While divisions persist among IMO members, practical solutions are already available to cut emissions, including slower vessel speeds, the adoption of carbon-free fuels, and wind-assisted propulsion technologies.
