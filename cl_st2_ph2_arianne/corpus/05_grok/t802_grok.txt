The People vs. Arctic Oil Trial has wrapped up after seven intense days in court, and we're now awaiting the judgment, which is expected in early January 2018. In this landmark case, Greenpeace and Nature and Youth presented arguments that Norway's Arctic oil drilling violates Article 112 of the Norwegian Constitution, which guarantees the right to a healthy environment for current and future generations. We also contended that this drilling breaches Norway's commitments under the Paris Agreement to limit global warming to 1.5°C.

Adding to the momentum, a UN Committee has urged Norway to revise its oil policy, highlighting how climate change disproportionately affects women. This trial is part of a broader wave of climate justice cases making progress around the world, including in the US, Philippines, Germany, and Netherlands.

The support for this case has been overwhelming, with over half a million people standing behind it. Even Norway's Central Bank has recommended divesting from oil and gas investments. As these developments unfold, the movement to hold governments and industries accountable for the climate crisis continues to grow stronger.
