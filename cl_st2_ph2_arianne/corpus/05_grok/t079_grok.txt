In the push for a just transition to green energy, it's crucial that we don't overlook the communities still suffering from the toxic legacy of our fossil fuel-dependent past. A truly just transition must extend support not only to workers and regions shifting away from polluting industries but also to those enduring the long-term harms of environmental racism and industrial pollution. Take South Durban in South Africa as a stark example: residents there grapple with deep poverty, widespread illness, and persistent air pollution from nearby industrial operations.

Research underscores how social determinants—like economic disadvantage—interact with pollution to heighten health risks. This is especially evident in the in-utero impacts on children, where exposure can impair lung, heart, and brain development, leading to neurocognitive issues such as reduced IQ. These effects trap communities in a generational cycle of disadvantage, where even as some pollutants decrease, the compounded harms continue to undermine future opportunities.

The Covid-19 pandemic has starkly illustrated these intertwined inequities, showing how pre-existing pollution and social vulnerabilities amplify crises and perpetuate injustice.
