Greenpeace, working hand-in-hand with scientists, is putting forward a vital rescue plan to save our oceans. This plan calls for the creation of a global network of ocean sanctuaries that would cover at least 30% of the seas by 2030. In these key areas, selected based on data about habitats, species, and climate impacts, activities like fishing, mining, and drilling would be banned.

These sanctuaries would stand apart from the ineffective "paper parks" we've seen in the past, with strict rules and real enforcement ensured through a new UN body established under a Global Ocean Treaty. To make this a reality, we need strong public support to push back against industry opposition and ensure the treaty is robust.

Our oceans are essential—they provide us with oxygen, food, and protection from climate change. By establishing these sanctuaries, we can boost the abundance of marine life and build greater resilience against threats such as climate change and pollution.
