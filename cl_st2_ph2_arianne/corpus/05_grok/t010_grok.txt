Artist Benjamin Von Wong has long used his art to highlight the dangers of plastic pollution. In 2016, he created an image of a mermaid ensnared in 10,000 plastic bottles. This project reached 35 million views, sparked discussions on disposable culture, and drove policy changes that reduced single-use plastic consumption.

Despite this progress, plastic production persists. Last year, Von Wong built a 4-story faucet installation at the UN for the Global Plastics Treaty, but its message was misconstrued.

Now, partnering with Greenpeace, he has created a 5-meter perpetual plastic machine that illustrates the fossil fuel-plastic lifecycle. This installation urges a strong treaty with a moratorium on virgin plastic production ahead of INC-2.
