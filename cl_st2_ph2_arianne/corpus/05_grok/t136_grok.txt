Cristiane Mazzetti recently returned from a 21-day expedition along the Manicoré River in the Amazon, where she joined efforts to support local communities in their 16-year struggle for territorial rights and the protection of their forests. Accompanied by scientists from INPA, the team carried out biodiversity research focusing on birds, mammals, botany, fish, reptiles, amphibians, and fossils. This work helped foster valuable exchanges between academic knowledge and the traditional wisdom of the communities.

During visits to these communities, the expedition highlighted their sustainable practices, including the harvesting of andiroba oil, açaí, cocoa, and cassava through agroforestry methods. A significant milestone was the issuance of the CDRU document, which grants land use rights and supports the push for establishing a Sustainable Development Reserve in the area.

Even in the face of ongoing threats from deforestation and land grabbing, the expedition has sparked renewed hope for the region, especially amid broader environmental challenges in Brazil.
