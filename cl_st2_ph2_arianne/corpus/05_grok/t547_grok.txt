Since 2013, BP has pursued oil drilling plans in the Amazon Reef region, pushing forward with decisions that fail to account for the serious negatives involved. At Greenpeace, we've been on the front lines documenting the incredible marine life here, including whale migration and breeding patterns. Our efforts have captured the first underwater footage of Bryde’s Rorqual in French Guiana, along with sightings of sailfishes, spotted dolphins, false killer whales, pygmy killer whales, silky sharks, and Melon head dolphins.

Despite clear evidence of the reef's vast extent and vulnerability, and even after Brazil's environmental agency IBAMA denied BP a drilling license in 2018 due to the risks of oil spills, the company continues to persist with its plans. It's time for a strong Global Ocean Treaty to safeguard our seas, for BP to withdraw from this area, and for urgent action to protect this diverse ecosystem.
