Over the past three years, Brazilian President Bolsonaro's anti-environmental agenda has inflicted severe damage on the country's natural landscapes and global climate efforts. Amazon deforestation has surged by 52.9%, accelerating the loss of this vital rainforest. Devastating fires have ravaged the Cerrado and Pantanal biomes, with the Pantanal losing a third of its area in 2020 alone. These policies have also driven a 10% increase in Brazil's greenhouse gas emissions, positioning the nation as the world's fifth-highest emitter.

Environmental protection agencies have been systematically undermined, with IBAMA facing a 30% budget cut and ICMBio a 32.7% reduction, alongside a 10% drop in staff. This weakening has paved the way for increased violence against Indigenous peoples and environmental activists, including 20 killings in 2021 and 1,576 land conflicts reported in 2020. Meanwhile, more than 1,500 new pesticides have been approved, many of which are banned in the EU.

Bolsonaro's administration has repeatedly attacked NGOs, while mishandling the COVID-19 pandemic and the economy. To safeguard Brazil's environment and its people, we must prevent his reelection.
