2016 was a tough year for our planet and its people. We saw power grabs by politicians and corporations that threatened progress on environmental protections. Activists were murdered for standing up for what's right, while devastating forest fires raged, coral reefs bleached on a massive scale, and ice melt accelerated, underscoring the urgency of the climate crisis.

But as we step into 2017, let's turn that reflection into resolve. It's time to commit to building a sustainable world through personal and collective actions. Start by honing your skills in campaigning and mobilizing others to join the fight. Take moments to recharge personally, ensuring you have the energy to keep going.

On a daily level, reduce your personal impact: eat less meat, avoid plastics, opt for walking or cycling instead of driving, and repair items rather than replacing them. Stand in solidarity with Indigenous Peoples and workers, and push back against injustice wherever it appears.

Use your voice powerfully—contact officials and companies to demand change. Call for stronger forest protection and real accountability on climate issues. Get involved by volunteering locally, and bring your friends and family into the actions to amplify our efforts. Together, we can make 2017 a year of meaningful progress.
