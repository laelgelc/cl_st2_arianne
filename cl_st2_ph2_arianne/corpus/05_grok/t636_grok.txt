In Russia, a significant portion of forests—amounting to 10% of the country's total and covering an area twice the size of Spain—has grown on land designated for agriculture. Under current laws, these forests are considered "illegal," which requires owners to clear them or face penalties. This often results in unrestrained logging or burning, releasing substantial amounts of CO2 into the atmosphere. The forests in question include old-growth areas dating back to Soviet times, as well as newer growth on lands that have been abandoned.

Greenpeace Russia's campaign has successfully prompted amendments to the federal Forest Code, leading to partial recognition of these forests. Properly regulating this vast expanse of 100 million hectares could boost biodiversity, facilitate tree planting initiatives, and establish a significant carbon sink. More than 50,000 people have signed a petition calling on President Putin to advance further reforms, with details on implementation still pending.

These Russian forests play a crucial role in supporting global climate stability and biodiversity.
