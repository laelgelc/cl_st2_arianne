Women in the Global South, especially in Africa, are bearing the brunt of the climate crisis in ways that disproportionately affect their lives. They often face exclusion from key decision-making processes, while their essential livelihoods in fishing and farming are increasingly under threat.

In Senegal, women fish processors have taken to the streets in protest against industrial trawlers that are depleting local fish stocks, essentially stealing the resources they depend on for survival.

Advocates are pushing for a deeper approach, one that integrates feminism and decoloniality to address the intertwined issues of climate, gender, racial, and economic justice.

There's a strong call for fundamental paradigm shifts to tackle these challenges, along with ensuring that LGBTIQ people are included in relief efforts.

The stories of six remarkable African women are shining a light on these issues as they lead vital conversations on climate action. Their work underscores the importance of women's roles in building resilience, preserving traditional knowledge, and combating inequality.
