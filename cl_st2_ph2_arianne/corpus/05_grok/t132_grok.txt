In a recent interview commemorating South African Women’s Day, activist Pregs Govender sat down with Yewande Omotoso to reflect on her lifelong work in activism. Govender emphasized the profound impact of her father on her approach to storytelling, underscoring the importance of claiming and owning one’s own narrative. She pointed out how Indigenous Peoples play a vital role in safeguarding the Earth, yet their contributions are frequently ignored in broader discussions.

Govender recounted personal stories about her mother’s practices of recycling and drawing on ancestral knowledge, drawing a connection to the environmental legacy of Wangari Maathai. She offered a sharp critique of the global system rooted in racism, capitalism, and patriarchy, which she described as being manipulated by billionaires for their gain. In response, Govender called for resistance grounded in love and courage, encouraging a reclamation of our shared interconnectedness to counter the divisions imposed by hierarchies of power.
