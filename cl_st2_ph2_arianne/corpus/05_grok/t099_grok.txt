Greenpeace Brasil, along with Climate Counsel and Observatorio do Clima, and with support from Greenpeace International, has submitted a Communication to the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC). This filing requests an investigation into the mass human rights abuses that have occurred in the Brazilian Amazon over the past decade, classifying them as crimes against humanity.

The evidence presented comes from an online platform that documents more than 12,000 conflicts in the region. These include 430 murders, 554 attempted murders, and the expulsion of 100,000 people. These acts have been orchestrated by a network involving politicians, public officials, businessmen, and criminals, all aimed at dispossessing land and exploiting natural resources.

The Communication also serves as a warning that financial and corporate actors who aid these activities could face scrutiny. It calls on the ICC to take action to end the impunity surrounding these abuses, even in the face of the court's resource challenges.
