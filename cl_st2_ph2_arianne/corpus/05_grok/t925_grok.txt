Greenpeace's Detox Outdoor campaign has taken a close look at major outdoor brands and their use of PFCs, uncovering widespread contamination in their products. Through a survey, we highlighted how these chemicals are prevalent in gear designed for nature lovers.

More than 30,000 votes from supporters helped select 40 items for detailed testing. The results showed PFCs in all but four of them, with particularly high levels of hazardous long-chain PFCs and PFOA found in products from brands like The North Face and Mammut.

These chemicals are persistent, spreading to remote areas, entering food chains, and impacting both wildlife and humans.

In a positive step, UK brand Páramo has committed to our Detox initiative, fully eliminating PFCs from its products and joining 34 other companies that have made similar pledges.

We call on the outdoor community to push brands such as Mammut and The North Face to end their use of these toxic chemicals and help safeguard the natural world we all cherish.
