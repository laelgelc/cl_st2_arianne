Indonesia's textile industry, valued at $20 billion, plays a major role in supplying global fashion brands. However, it has led to significant environmental harm, including pollution of rivers such as the Citarum. This pollution has made rice fields unproductive starting from the 1990s, resulting in economic losses amounting to IDR11.4 trillion (US$838 million) between 2004 and 2015.

A positive development came in May 2016 with a court victory that suspended government decrees allowing wastewater discharges from three companies: PT. Kahatex, PT. Insan Sandang Internusa, and PT. Five Star Textile. The permits for these discharges were issued without adequate studies or monitoring, and the court applied the precautionary principle in its decision.

This ruling brings inspiration and hope for the possibility of cleaner rivers in the region. At Greenpeace, we call on fashion brands to honor their Detox commitments, which are essential for safeguarding public health and preserving ecosystems.
