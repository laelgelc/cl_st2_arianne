The aviation industry is rife with greenwashing, where airlines make misleading claims about their sustainability efforts. These claims often rely on false solutions that don't truly address the sector's massive carbon footprint. For instance, carbon offsetting is presented as a way to neutralize emissions, but it fails to reduce them effectively in practice.

Another touted solution is sustainable aviation fuels (SAF), which airlines promote as a path to greener flying. However, SAF are scarce, often unsustainable in their production, and insufficient to achieve the decarbonization needed for the industry.

The sector also leans on efficiency improvements and the concept of "net zero," which perpetuate myths that delay genuine action on climate change. Meanwhile, aviation benefits from substantial subsidies and tax exemptions that prop up its polluting practices.

To keep global warming limited to 1.5°C, flights in Europe must decrease by 2% each year. It's time for real change: ban advertisements for fossil fuels, end the subsidies that favor aviation, impose taxes on kerosene, and promote rail alternatives to ensure a just transition away from over-reliance on air travel.
