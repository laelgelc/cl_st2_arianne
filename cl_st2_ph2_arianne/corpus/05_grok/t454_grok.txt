The Acampamento Terra Livre, recognized as the world's largest Indigenous gathering held in Brasília, has been canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Indigenous Peoples from Brazil are demanding that the government take action to protect their rights and lands amid this crisis.

Even as these communities isolate to avoid the virus, they remain exposed to risks from illegal invaders, including miners and loggers, who continue to encroach on their territories. Reports indicate ten deaths from COVID-19 among Indigenous groups, including a Yanomami boy, in a situation that echoes the historical devastations caused by diseases brought by outsiders.

Beyond the virus, these communities face additional threats from Amazon fires, which lead to respiratory issues, and mercury contamination resulting from mining activities.

Under President Bolsonaro's administration, funding cuts to FUNAI and related policies have contributed to doubled deforestation alerts and increased forest destruction within Indigenous territories. These developments are endangering the lives of Indigenous Peoples, the Amazon rainforest, and the global climate.

The ongoing pandemic is highlighting systemic vulnerabilities in these areas, underscoring the need for governments to prioritize the well-being of people and the planet.
