Extreme weather events are intensifying around the world due to climate change, from devastating droughts and floods to raging fires, and even the rapid melting of ice in the Arctic and Antarctic regions. These crises are not isolated; they're interconnected symptoms of a planet under severe stress.

Greenpeace's analysis reveals a particularly alarming contributor: the peatland fires in Indonesia from 2015 to 2018. These fires released CO2 emissions equivalent to Russia's entire annual output, an amount comparable to the emissions from coal plants. Shockingly, these emissions remain unaccounted for by the companies and countries involved.

Labeled as "carbon bombs," these fires not only explode with massive greenhouse gas releases but also generate toxic haze that spreads far and wide, affecting global health and climate stability.

Even sustainability leaders and global brands bear indirect responsibility through their connections to palm oil supply chains that fuel such destruction. It's time for transparent action: we must stop the burning, protect our forests, and work towards a green, peaceful world for future generations.
