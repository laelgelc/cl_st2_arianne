Wildfires have ravaged southeast Siberia in Russia, particularly in Zabaikalsky krai, where they have destroyed homes, farms, and livestock. The blazes have injured 34 people and caused one death, leading to a state of emergency declaration.

Greenpeace Russia's firefighting team, led by Grigory Kuksin, has stepped in to provide humanitarian aid. They delivered burn-treatment bandages, supplies for firefighters, and essentials such as clothes and food to affected families in remote areas.

Kuksin witnessed smoldering ruins, burnt prairies, and fires spreading rapidly due to strong winds. These fires often start from arson.

Human causes are a key factor in these wildfires. To prevent them, it's crucial to extinguish cigarettes and campfires properly.

We urge you to donate to support our efforts in responding to such disasters.
