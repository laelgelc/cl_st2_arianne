Over one million people around the world are urging corporations to end single-use plastics, and Greenpeace is celebrating this massive show of support. This movement highlights local bans on single-use plastics and community cleanups where participants audit the collected waste to hold companies accountable.

We're introducing the "Million Acts of Blue" goal, where an Act of Blue is defined as any action that prevents the creation of single-use plastic. This is inspired by the need to protect the planet and ensure corporate accountability.

To help you get involved, we're promoting a toolkit that includes guides for community actions. These cover presentations, media outreach, targeting supermarkets to reduce plastic use, and urging fast food places to eliminate throwaway items.
