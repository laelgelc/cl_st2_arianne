In 2017, Greenpeace conducted a radiation survey in Fukushima's contaminated areas, revealing significant issues with the decontamination efforts. Our findings highlighted the ineffective nature of the program in locations such as Iitate and Namie, where decontamination has failed to adequately address the ongoing radiation risks.

One major problem is recontamination from the surrounding forests, which continue to spread radioactive materials back into cleaned areas. This cycle undermines the efforts to make these zones safe for habitation.

The decontamination process has also generated a vast amount of nuclear waste, with projections estimating up to 30 million cubic meters. This waste is currently stored at over 141,000 sites across the region, and there are massive transports underway to move it to interim storage facilities in Okuma and Futaba.

Despite these challenges, the government is pressuring evacuees to return to these areas, even as risks persist. This approach overlooks the exploitation of workers involved in the decontamination and the high costs associated with the program.

Greenpeace urges the government to accept the recommendations from the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) to provide better support for the affected citizens, with particular emphasis on women and children who have been disproportionately impacted.
