Biodiversity represents the vast variety of life on Earth, which is essential for the interconnected survival of all species. It provides crucial benefits such as supporting human health, ensuring food security, and aiding in climate adaptation.

The upcoming CBD COP15 in Kunming, China, this fall 2022, presents a critical opportunity for governments worldwide to adopt a new framework aimed at addressing the biodiversity crisis. This framework includes commitments to protect 30% of lands and oceans by 2030, respect the rights of Indigenous Peoples, and secure necessary finance and implementation plans to halt mass extinction.

We are currently facing a human-driven biodiversity crisis that threatens one million species with extinction. Only 15% of forests remain intact, and just 3% of oceans are pristine. This loss not only worsens climate change but also increases the risk of zoonotic diseases, such as COVID-19.

At Greenpeace, we are advocating for ambitious outcomes from COP15 to protect biodiversity and ensure a sustainable future for all.
