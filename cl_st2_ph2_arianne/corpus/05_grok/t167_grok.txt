Pepsi and Coca-Cola have been rivals for over a century, but now it's time for Pepsi to step up in the fight against plastic pollution, a crisis that's deeply linked to climate change. Both companies are among the top polluters through their reliance on single-use plastics, which end up choking our oceans and harming the planet.

Coca-Cola has committed to making 25% of its packaging reusable or refillable by 2030. Pepsi, on the other hand, currently stands at 0% and has only pledged to set a reuse goal by the end of 2022. That's not enough. Reuse systems are crucial for cutting down on waste that pollutes our oceans, and they require building infrastructure and fostering collaboration to make them work.

We challenge Pepsi to go beyond Coca-Cola's target and aim for at least 50% reusable or refillable packaging by 2030. Let's pressure Pepsi's CEO ahead of the May shareholder meeting to make this happen.
