My environmental journey began in 1990, when I met a farmer in Zimbabwe struggling with drought. Today, my focus is on human-made climate change. Supported by over 2000 Climate Seniors, I traveled along the Rhine to Strasbourg to appeal at the European Court of Human Rights. We are inspired by successful climate lawsuits and aim to set a precedent.

Growing up in Switzerland, I lament the melting glaciers, such as Pizol. After leaving academia to fund green startups, I joined Climate Seniors at age 72. In 2016, we challenged Swiss climate targets, but faced rejections despite acknowledgment from the Supreme Court. It's like ignoring avalanche prevention. We vow to persist.
