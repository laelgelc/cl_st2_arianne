Brazil's National Institute for Space Research (INPE) has reported that 11,568 square kilometers of the Amazon rainforest were deforested between July 2021 and August 2022. This area is equivalent to about 1.6 million soccer fields.

During President Jair Bolsonaro's term from 2019 to 2022, a total of 45,586 square kilometers of the Amazon was lost. This represents a 53% increase compared to the period from 2015 to 2018. Bolsonaro's anti-environment and anti-Indigenous policies contributed to this rise by enabling illegal logging, mining, and land-grabbing. His administration did not recognize any new Indigenous Lands since 1988.

The Amazon is approaching a tipping point, with some parts now emitting more carbon than they store. Deforestation accounts for 40% of Brazil's emissions, primarily through fires, which have also harmed public health during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Bolsonaro lost the recent election to Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who has pledged to protect the Amazon and attended the COP27 climate conference. Lula must now implement robust plans to curb the destruction, protect Indigenous rights, and enforce accountability.
