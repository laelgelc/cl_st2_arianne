Remember when Barbie dumped Ken? In our fictional twist, it wasn't just about Ken's plastic lifestyle—it was a wake-up call to Mattel's packaging choices. Back then, Mattel was using products from Asia Pulp and Paper (APP), which were linked to the destruction of Indonesia's rainforests and the loss of habitat for Sumatran tigers.

Greenpeace stepped in to expose APP's greenwashing tactics, revealing how their practices were harming these vital ecosystems. We rallied supporters worldwide, generating over 500,000 emails to Mattel. This massive pressure led Mattel to implement a global policy that excludes deforestation from their supply chains. They committed to avoiding controversial sources, increasing the use of recycled paper, and boosting FSC-certified wood in their products.

This victory builds on similar actions by companies like Nestlé and Unilever, all of which are pushing APP to reform its destructive practices. But the fight isn't over. We need your help to keep investigating and stopping deforestation. Donate today and get involved to protect our planet's forests.
