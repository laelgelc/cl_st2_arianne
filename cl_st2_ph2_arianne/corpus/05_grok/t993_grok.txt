Greenpeace is calling out Mattel for using packaging that's linked to deforestation in Indonesia's rainforests. In a satirical twist, we're dubbing Barbie's latest "career" as 'Rainforest Destroyer' and launching a contest where people can design her new look.

This isn't just a problem with Mattel—similar issues plague the supply chains of Hasbro, Disney, and Lego. We're urging all toy companies to take immediate action: commit to suspending purchases from Asia Pulp and Paper until it stops deforestation, and adopt strong sustainable procurement policies.

Supporters can get involved by messaging Mattel directly, sharing our revealing video, engaging on social media, and joining the contest for a chance to win a prize.
