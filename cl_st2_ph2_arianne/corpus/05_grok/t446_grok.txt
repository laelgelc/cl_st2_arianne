The COVID-19 crisis has laid bare the deep flaws in our socio-economic systems, revealing our shared vulnerability and the intricate interdependence that binds us all. It underscores the urgent need for a green and just transition toward resilient practices that respect ecological limits.

This moment calls us to rethink fundamental aspects of our lives—production, consumption, work, and beyond—through commons-based models. These include distributed manufacturing, open access licensing, Distributed Cooperative Organizations (DisCOs), platform cooperatives, and farmland trusts.

At their core, commons revolve around shared resources, communities, and governance rules. We see this in action through examples like Wikipedia, community-supported agriculture, and the open-source responses that emerged during the pandemic.

This movement champions values of care, openness, collaboration, and abundance. It aligns with degrowth and ecofeminism, paving the way for fairer and more participatory alternatives.
