In recent years, we've seen how climate catastrophes and the ongoing pandemic have laid bare deep structural inequalities across societies. These crises disproportionately affect marginalized communities, revealing the urgent need for systemic change.

That's why we must push for stringent regulation in key sectors such as agriculture and energy. These regulations should be grounded in human rights principles, thorough environmental assessments, and the explicit consent of women and Indigenous Peoples, ensuring that decisions respect those most impacted.

At the same time, it's critical to call out wealthy nations and corporations for their profiteering during these crises. They've often prioritized gains over people and the planet, exacerbating the very problems we're facing.

Finally, redistributing power away from corporations is key. This can be achieved through strong accountability measures, including a binding international treaty to hold them responsible and ensure equitable outcomes.
