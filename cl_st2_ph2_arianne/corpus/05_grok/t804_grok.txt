Extreme wildfires and storms are serving as stark, visceral reminders of the impacts of global heating, and they might just represent a turning point in how the public perceives this crisis. In regions like Russia, China, Mongolia, North America, and Europe, record-breaking fires have raged, driven by intense heat waves and prolonged droughts. These blazes have led to massive destruction, loss of life, and the evacuation of countless communities.

Meanwhile, powerful storms such as Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Maria, and Ophelia have been supercharged by warmer ocean waters, breaking records for their accumulated cyclone energy and inflicting unprecedented damages across the United States and Europe.

As temperatures continue to climb, we face the risk of non-linear escalations in these extreme events. It's crucial that we take decisive action, guided by the seven megatrends that can drive meaningful change. Looking back, climate science has long provided the warnings, yet historical efforts have fallen short in actually reducing emissions.
