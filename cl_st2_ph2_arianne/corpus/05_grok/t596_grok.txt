The climate crisis demands immediate action, and we have just a decade to make transformative changes, including phasing out diesel and petrol vehicles to curb emissions. In Europe, the transport sector accounts for over a quarter of CO2 emissions, with 45% of those coming from roads.

Research from the Ecologic Institute and Greenpeace Germany identifies six key policy measures to drive this shift toward electric vehicles (EVs). First, governments should ban sales of internal combustion engine vehicles and mandate production quotas for EVs. Second, expand subsidized charging infrastructure to support widespread adoption. Third, adapt incentives to align with evolving market trends. Fourth, implement mixed policies that combine subsidies with mandates. Fifth, tax polluters while providing incentives for EVs. Sixth, clearly communicate the benefits of these changes to the public.

EVs represent one element of a larger transition, which includes reducing reliance on personal cars and enhancing renewable-powered public transport, cycling, and walking.
