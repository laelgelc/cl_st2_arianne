Today is World Meat Free Day, a perfect opportunity to celebrate the positive impact we can all make by reducing our meat consumption. By cutting back on meat, we can benefit our personal health and help protect the planet.

There are many ways to get started, such as joining Meat Free Mondays, adopting a flexitarian lifestyle, or opting for higher-quality meat when we do eat it. The key is that even small changes in our habits can add up to a huge global impact.

Industrial animal agriculture is responsible for 14% of all greenhouse gas emissions— that's the same as emissions from all road vehicles combined. It also drives deforestation, water pollution, and climate change.

To avoid catastrophe, we need to embrace a "less is better" approach to meat consumption. According to our sustainability calculator, if 10,000 people go meat-free for just one day, it saves significant amounts of CO2 and water.
