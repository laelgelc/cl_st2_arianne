In the bustling city of Douala, Cameroon, Nathalie Wamja, a dedicated Greenpeace volunteer, has witnessed firsthand the devastating impact of plastic waste. She describes how this pollution leads to recurring floods by blocking drains, which in turn ruins homes, livelihoods, water quality, food, and even lives.

Motivated by the hardships faced by her own family and friends affected by these issues, Nathalie has taken a close look at the problem. She has observed plastic bottles and packaging clogging gutters, even though import bans are in place.

She strongly advocates for a total ban on plastic production and imports, which she believes would promote sustainable alternatives such as refill and reuse systems.

In her daily life, Nathalie lives plastic-free and reuses items whenever possible. She educates vendors about the issue, shares awareness through WhatsApp articles and petitions, organizes clean-ups with local associations, and conducts brand audits to identify the companies responsible for the pollution. She emphasizes that while clean-ups help, they are insufficient without broader systemic change.
