Our global food system is in crisis. The industrial, chemical-intensive approach to agriculture is harming people, farmers, and the planet itself. It's time for a fundamental shift toward ecological farming—a method that puts people first, boosts biodiversity, steers clear of harmful chemicals, and combines cutting-edge science with traditional local knowledge. This vision is outlined in Greenpeace’s Food and Farming Vision, offering a roadmap for a healthier, more sustainable way to produce food.

To illustrate what this shift could look like in everyday life, I recently enjoyed a simple traditional Spanish breakfast: fresh bread topped with ripe tomatoes, a drizzle of olive oil, and a sprinkle of salt—all sourced from local, organic producers. It's a small but meaningful way to embrace and support ecological practices.

We can all play a part by making choices like buying local produce, cutting back on meat consumption, minimizing food waste, and even growing some of our own food. At the same time, we must push governments and companies to invest in ecological farming to drive the broader systemic changes needed for a resilient food future.
