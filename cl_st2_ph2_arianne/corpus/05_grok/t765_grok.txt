The International Seabed Authority (ISA) is pushing ahead with finalizing regulations for commercial deep sea mining, even though claims that these minerals are essential for renewable energy have been refuted. Reports indicate that sufficient terrestrial resources already exist to meet those needs. However, this mining poses serious risks of severe and permanent environmental damage, including habitat destruction and loss of biodiversity.

Concerns about the ISA's process are mounting due to its lack of transparency. The authority has rejected proposals for an environmental committee and has already approved 28 exploration contracts that cover vast areas of the seabed.

Opposition to deep sea mining is building on multiple fronts. Local communities in Papua New Guinea have resisted Nautilus Minerals' Solwara project. The EU Parliament has called for a moratorium, and more than 800,000 supporters have joined calls for a ban to safeguard unexplored ecosystems.
