Today marks what would have been Dorothy Stowe's 100th birthday. She passed away ten years ago in Vancouver, the city where she co-founded Greenpeace alongside her husband Irving and a group of fellow pacifists and ecologists.

A photo from 2009 shows her at a CD release party celebrating the 1970 concert that featured Joni Mitchell and James Taylor and helped launch Greenpeace. Dorothy embodied unwavering dedication, modesty, and kindness throughout her life. She always focused her activism on the issues at hand rather than on herself, volunteering for any task that needed doing and remaining unintimidated even when facing figures like Canada's Prime Minister.

Dorothy and Irving held their wedding at NAACP headquarters. They became Quakers committed to peace and justice, and they adopted the surname "Stowe" in honor of Harriet Beecher Stowe. In Greenpeace's early years, they provided a stabilizing and inclusive influence, inspiring those around them through their hard work and heart.
