In the shadow of historical colonialism, a modern form of exploitation is unfolding across African nations and other countries in the global majority: the dumping of plastic waste from Western countries. This practice, often termed "waste colonialism," mirrors the exploitative dynamics of the past by impoverishing local communities, generating severe health problems, and diverting attention from truly sustainable solutions.

A recent UN report highlights how these waste exports disproportionately affect marginalized people of color, exacerbating inequalities rooted in colonial legacies. These legacies persist today through practices such as France's so-called "colonial tax" on former colonies and widespread illegal fishing that depletes African waters.

The situation intensified after China's 2018 ban on plastic waste imports, leading to a surge in shipments to countries like Senegal and Kenya. There, unmanaged waste piles up, poisoning environments and livelihoods.

To break this cycle of injustice, we need a robust global plastic treaty that enforces binding rules, slashes the production of single-use plastics, and ensures accountable waste management systems. Only through such measures can we dismantle this new wave of exploitation and foster equity for all.
