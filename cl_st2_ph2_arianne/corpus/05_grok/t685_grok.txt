As a student, barista, and Greenpeace Indonesia activist from Manado, I cherish my childhood memories of Christmas visits to my grandmother in beautiful North Sulawesi. One special trip took us to Lembeh Island, where we enjoyed stunning views of Bitung and Mount Klabat.

But now, I lament how Bitung has been transformed into a site of forest destruction. Even my favorite brands are playing a role in endangering the habitats of the Cenderawasih bird, orangutans, and Sumatran tigers.

It was on Kuta Beach in Bali that I found my inspiration and committed to direct action. I joined global activists on a rubber boat to demand that Wilmar #DropDirtyPalmOil immediately, for greener forests and free wildlife.

I invite you to participate.
