As a Wapishana campaigner for Greenpeace Brazil, I, Ariene Susuí, felt profound sadness during flights over the Munduruku and Kayapó Indigenous Lands, where I went to document illegal mining. This mining is an indefensible crime that destroys forests, rivers, and Indigenous lives, all for the sake of gold. We need alternative economic models that preserve life instead.

From above, I observed vast pits and mud-like devastation stretching across the landscape. It brought back reflections on childhood warnings I heard, stories from leaders about invasions and diseases brought by outsiders, and the sacredness of our land.

This illegal mining relies on heavy machinery, such as Hyundai excavators, and it bathes the extracted gold in Indigenous blood. We must take action against it.
