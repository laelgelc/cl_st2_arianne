The Paris Agreement aims to limit global warming to 1.5°C, which calls for radical changes across industries. In the electricity sector, progress is being made, with renewables now supplying over 20% of power in the EU. However, transport emissions are on the rise, driven by increasing car sales, particularly of SUVs.

A study commissioned by Greenpeace and conducted by German researchers forecasts that without further action, the adoption of electric vehicles alone won't be enough. To remain within the transport sector's carbon budget, the study indicates that Europe must ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars by 2028.

Norway provides a strong example of what's possible, having achieved rapid growth in electric vehicles through incentives and setting a goal for all new cars to be zero-emission by 2025. Beyond electric vehicles, achieving sustainability in transport will require broader measures, such as expanding bike lanes, making public transport more affordable, and promoting car sharing.
