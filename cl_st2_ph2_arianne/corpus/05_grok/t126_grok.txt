Governments are negotiating a new Global Ocean Treaty at the United Nations to determine the oceans' future. Signed by numerous actors, activists, and experts, the letter emphasizes the oceans' vital role in sustaining life, biodiversity, and billions of people. Facing threats like industrial fishing and deep sea mining, over 100 governments and scientists support protecting 30% of oceans by 2030. A strong treaty is essential to create high seas sanctuaries, as current protections are lacking. After nearly two decades of talks, urgent action is needed to avoid further crisis; over 5 million people demand a robust treaty.
