Grassroots movements have long been at the heart of driving meaningful social change, mobilizing people from all walks of life to challenge injustices and push for a better world. At Greenpeace, we're excited to introduce a new series of live online Roundtable discussions, co-created with activists, scientists, and other experts. These sessions delve into key themes such as diversity, solidarity, and intersectionality, fostering important conversations that can inspire action.

The series features several compelling panels. One focuses on the health impacts of the climate crisis in vulnerable regions, with insights from experts at Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) and others who highlight the urgent challenges faced by affected communities. Another panel explores activism in the Amazon, discussing the threats to this vital ecosystem and the critical needs for its protection. We also address activist burnout, sharing strategies for building resilience and sustaining long-term commitment to the cause. Finally, a panel on intergenerational activism emphasizes the power of cross-generational alliances in advancing environmental and social justice.

We invite everyone to join us in these discussions and collaborate on solutions. As panelists have noted, the issues we face are deeply interconnected, underscoring the need for unified efforts across diverse groups.
