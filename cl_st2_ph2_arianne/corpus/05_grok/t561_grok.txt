As an Indigenous campaigner with Greenpeace USA, I'm honored to reflect on the global struggles of Indigenous Peoples as we fight to protect our cultures, lands, and sacred natural elements. These efforts persist amid ongoing threats from development, deforestation, and climate change.

Around the world, supportive organizations and projects are aiding these struggles in countries including the US, Brazil, Argentina, Cameroon, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Morocco, Russia, and Indonesia.

On this International Day of the World’s Indigenous People, we celebrate the frontline activists leading the way. Environmental and social justice are deeply intertwined, with Indigenous territories holding 80% of global biodiversity. True climate justice demands Indigenous sovereignty.

Greenpeace stands in solidarity with Indigenous Peoples everywhere and is planning a global summit on human rights and climate change.
