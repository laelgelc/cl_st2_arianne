For the third year in a row, global brand audits have pinpointed Coca-Cola, Nestlé, and PepsiCo as the top plastic polluters. These companies continue to invest in false solutions while partnering with oil companies to ramp up plastic production.

It's time for these firms to take real action: end their reliance on single-use plastic packaging, shift away from fossil fuels, and support regulations that will shrink their plastic footprint and help fight climate change.

Plastic is made almost entirely—99%—from fossil fuels, which drives climate problems. It's toxic at every stage of its lifecycle, and only 2% is recycled in a truly circular way.

Millions of people are calling for change through petitions, lobbying, and community actions, all aimed at promoting refill and reuse systems.
