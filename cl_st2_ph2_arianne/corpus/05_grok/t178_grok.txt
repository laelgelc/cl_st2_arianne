Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has exposed vulnerabilities in global energy systems and accelerated a worldwide food crisis. This situation is exacerbating food insecurity, particularly in the climate-vulnerable Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, which depends heavily on grain imports from Ukraine and Russia.

The conflict is disrupting supply chains and driving up food prices. It is also worsening existing challenges such as water scarcity, reduced crop yields, and humanitarian crises in places like Yemen.

Fossil fuels are adding to these threats to food security, for example through risks associated with the FSO Safer tanker.

To address these issues, there is a call to transition to resilient, local, and sustainable food systems. These should be grounded in food sovereignty, ecological farming practices, and community-led initiatives. At the same time, it is essential to demand climate justice from wealthy nations.
