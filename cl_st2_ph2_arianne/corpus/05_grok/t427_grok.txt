The COVID-19 pandemic has laid bare the vulnerabilities in our consumption-driven economies and our deep reliance on nature. It has shown how fragile these systems are when faced with disruption, highlighting the need for fundamental change.

At the heart of the issue is recycling, which is often inefficient and serves mainly as a distraction. It allows us to avoid the real solutions: reducing production and consumption altogether.

Instead, we need to embrace a "slow circular economy." This approach prioritizes refusing and reducing waste from the outset. It involves mindful designs that create simple, repairable, durable, and modular products, all made from local, renewable, and non-toxic resources.

Corporations, however, tend to focus solely on recycling as a way to sustain their growth models, without addressing the root problems.

Encouragingly, emerging practices are pointing the way forward, such as incentives for repairs, limits on advertising, and alternative economic models.

To achieve genuine sustainability, we must push for transparency and localization, while integrating circular principles into our social and financial systems.
