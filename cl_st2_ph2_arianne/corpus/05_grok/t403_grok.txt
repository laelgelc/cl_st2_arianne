Oil spills are an inevitable risk of relying on fossil fuels, and the data we have is incomplete, often overlooking most small incidents. We've known about the dangers of CO2 emissions since as far back as 1965. Now, in the midst of a climate emergency, these risks are playing out in devastating ways around the world.

Take the MV Wakashio spill in Mauritius, where oil damaged coral reefs and affected the economy, health, and food security. In Venezuela's Falcón state, oil has washed ashore, impacting biodiversity and local communities. Off the coast of Yemen, the unattended FSO Safer tanker poses a threat of catastrophe in the Red Sea. A Pemex pipeline leak in Mexico has contaminated fields and displaced families. And in the Russian Arctic, a massive Nornickel spill has polluted rivers.

It's clear we need a faster transition to renewables to avoid these ongoing disasters.
