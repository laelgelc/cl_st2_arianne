Movie director Wang Shaudi sees filmmaking as both a social movement and a path to self-improvement. In her works, such as the 2003 film Banquet, she delves into the delicate balance between environmental conservation and economic development in Taiwan. By conducting fieldwork and consulting with experts, she has brought attention to the stresses on land caused by climate change.

Wang advocates strongly against nuclear energy and supports marriage equality. She encourages everyday eco-friendly actions, like sorting waste on film sets and opting for a walking bicycle. Even when facing feelings of powerlessness in the face of extreme weather events, such as the Australian fires and floods in China, she continues her efforts.

Her inspiration comes from poignant scenes, including one of an indigenous musician playing amid trash on a beach. Through it all, she urges people to make lifestyle adjustments to create a better future.
