Greenpeace campaigner Asti Roesle has voiced serious concerns about the Forest Stewardship Council's (FSC) recent decision to re-associate with the timber group Danzer. Danzer was previously disassociated from FSC in 2013 due to human rights violations in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).

Roesle describes the re-association process as lacking rigor, pointing out that violations occurred early on and that the process failed to implement Free Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC) as recommended by the Forest Peoples Programme. While acknowledging some benefits to communities, she argues that the decision comes too soon.

Roesle calls on FSC to put environmental and social concerns ahead of business interests, to enhance standards in high-risk areas, and to put forward robust measures at the upcoming September General Assembly.
