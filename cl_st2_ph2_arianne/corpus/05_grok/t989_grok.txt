The Arctic is one of the most pristine and fragile environments on Earth, yet oil companies continue to push for drilling there despite overwhelming risks. Here are ten compelling reasons why Arctic oil drilling should be stopped.

First, drilling in the Arctic is extremely dangerous due to the harsh environment, where extreme weather and remote locations amplify the hazards of any operation.

Second, it's unnecessary because we could achieve far greater fuel efficiency in vehicles if laws promoting this aren't blocked by industry interests, reducing the need for new oil sources.

Third, Arctic drilling is incompatible with global climate goals, as extracting oil from this fragile region would exacerbate warming and environmental damage in an area already under severe threat.

Fourth, drilling relief wells poses major challenges in the Arctic's short open-water seasons, potentially leading to prolonged oil spills that can't be quickly contained.

Fifth, recovering spilled oil in icy conditions is virtually impossible, leaving any leaks to spread unchecked across vast frozen expanses.

Sixth, response capacity is inadequate, with too few ships and resources available to handle emergencies in such a remote and ice-bound area.

Seventh, oil breaks down naturally very slowly in the cold Arctic waters, meaning spills could persist and cause long-term harm to ecosystems.

Eighth, the region's wildlife is highly vulnerable, including birds, whales, seals, polar bears, and foxes, all of which could suffer devastating impacts from oil contamination.

Ninth, the costs are exorbitantly high, as demonstrated by Cairn Energy's failed attempts that resulted in billion-dollar losses without success.

Tenth, the potential oil supply from the Arctic is limited, equivalent to just three years of global demand, making the enormous risks completely unjustified.
