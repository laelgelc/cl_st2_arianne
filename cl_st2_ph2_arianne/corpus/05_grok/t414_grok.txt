In Russia's Bashkortostan region, the sacred Shihan Kushtau—a unique limestone mountain home to rare species—is under threat from mining operations by the Bashkir Soda Company. The company aims to extract limestone for an outdated method of soda production that relies on this resource.

Local activists have mobilized to protect the mountain, setting up camps and forming human chains to block tree cutting and fencing efforts. On August 15, police raided the protest camp, detaining 80 people, beating protesters, and damaging equipment belonging to journalists.

Despite the violence and spread of misinformation, the persistent protests prompted the head of the republic to promise a halt to all activities on the mountain to allow for dialogue.

Greenpeace Russia has filed official complaints in response. We are demanding protected status for Kushtau, the release of detained activists, and a shift to sustainable technologies for soda production.
