As the COVID-19 pandemic keeps many of us in quarantine, it's crucial to maintain our commitment to climate activism while prioritizing staying home to protect vulnerable communities, including Indigenous ones. By staying indoors, we can help safeguard those most at risk and continue our efforts in meaningful ways.

One approach is to engage family members in dinner table discussions about local climate issues, fostering awareness right at home. Building connections with advocacy groups can also keep you involved, as can staying informed through books, documentaries, and webinars. Participating in online forums offers another way to exchange ideas and stay connected with the movement.

For digital activism, consider creating Instagram filters, organizing Twitter storms, or producing TikTok content to share accurate news and amplify climate messages.

It's also a good time to review personal habits. Reducing meat consumption can make a difference, given that livestock accounts for 14.5% of global emissions. Experiment with plant-based recipes to explore sustainable eating options. Minimize single-use plastics by reusing items and recycling whenever possible. Growing your own food and preventing waste are additional steps that promote solidarity and contribute to broader impact.
