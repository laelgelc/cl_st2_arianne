On World Fisheries Day, a powerful gathering took place in Dakar where West African women fish processors came together to protest the expansion of fishmeal factories that are putting their jobs at risk. These factories are converting fresh fish into meal destined for animal feed in Europe and Asia, which not only endangers local livelihoods but also poses threats to food security and marine ecosystems. This practice stands in contradiction to the UN sustainable development goals.

In Senegal, the fisheries sector is vital, supporting over 600,000 jobs and supplying 70% of the country's animal protein requirements. The women at the protest are calling on the government to take decisive action: halt the construction of new factories, end the use of edible fish for meal production, and instead provide support to their businesses through refrigerating units. They emphasize that artisanal processing methods generate significantly more employment opportunities compared to the factories.
