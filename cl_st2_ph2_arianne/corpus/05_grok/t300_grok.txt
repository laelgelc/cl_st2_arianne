In September 2021, Greenpeace marked its 50th anniversary, tracing back to its first campaign against a U.S. nuclear bomb test in Amchitka, Alaska. The origins of the organization took root in the 1960s in Vancouver, where a diverse group of peace activists, ecologists, and draft resisters came together. Figures such as Irving and Dorothy Stowe, Bob Hunter, Ben and Dorothy Metcalfe, Jim and Marie Bohlen, and Bill Darnell converged amid the broader anti-war, civil rights, and environmental movements of the era.

This group formed the Don’t Make a Wave Committee, drawing inspiration from Quaker protests. Their plan was to sail a boat to confront the nuclear test directly. In combining the ideals of peace and ecology, they adopted the name "Greenpeace."
