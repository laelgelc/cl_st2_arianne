At Greenpeace, we're shining a light on the ongoing issue of PFC pollution from DuPont facilities, which has impacted communities around the world. Take the story of Dutch couple Jan and Ineke van Genderen, who live near the Dordrecht plant and have elevated levels of PFOA in their blood. Similarly, in the US, residents Gwen and Earl Botkin have been affected by contamination in the Ohio River.

This pollution ties into a class action lawsuit that exposed DuPont's cover-up of PFOA's health risks. The chemical has been linked to diseases such as high cholesterol, cancers, and thyroid issues.

Greenpeace is partnering for protests, hearings, and investigations to address this. We've noted that PFOA is being replaced with shorter-chain PFCs that are also hazardous. We urge everyone to support efforts to combat these toxic chemicals.
