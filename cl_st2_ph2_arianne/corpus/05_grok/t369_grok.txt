In a world grappling with interconnected global crises—climate change, right-wing populism, health issues, discrimination, inequality, and economic pressures—many people are left feeling hopeless. At Greenpeace Europe, we're committed to intersectional campaigning that weaves environmentalism together with people, politics, and the economy to address these root causes head-on.

To explore these connections, we spoke with four inspiring climate justice activists who are pushing for transformative change.

Guppi Bola highlighted the need to decolonise economics to achieve racial and climate justice.

Chihiro Geuzebroek discussed halting production, implementing universal basic income, and transforming work to be more ethical.

Tatiana Garavito focused on creating new systems for nourishment that avoid exploitation.

Samie Blasingame advocated for reforming global food systems and treating agricultural land as a global common.

By centering these voices, we can reimagine and build a better world together.
