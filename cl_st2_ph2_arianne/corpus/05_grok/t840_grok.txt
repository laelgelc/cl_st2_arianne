In a recent discussion, Dr. Paul Johnston, a scientist with Greenpeace, addressed the profound effects of climate change on our world. He pointed out that while the planet itself will endure, it will do so in a significantly altered form. Already committed changes, such as rising sea levels and increasing food insecurity, underscore the urgency of the situation.

Dr. Johnston stressed the critical need to take action now to limit further damage. He dismissed climate denial outright, calling it delusional in the face of overwhelming evidence. He also cautioned against relying on geoengineering, describing it as a misleading fix that doesn't address the root problems.

On a positive note, he highlighted the advancements made in environmental protections, showing that progress is possible. Dr. Johnston encouraged individuals to make a difference through personal choices, like cutting down on waste and inspiring those around them to do the same.

He voiced strong support for the March for Science, which aims to protect evidence-based research from threats. Despite obstacles such as the spread of fake news and reductions in funding, Dr. Johnston remains optimistic about our ability to confront these challenges head-on.
