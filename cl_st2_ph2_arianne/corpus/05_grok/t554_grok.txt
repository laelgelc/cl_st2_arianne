Toru Anzai, a former resident of Iitate, misses gathering bamboo shoots from his Fukushima village, which has been abandoned since the 2011 nuclear disaster. The village's population has dropped from 6,300 to about 900, mostly elderly returnees, amid ongoing radiation exposure that exceeds safety standards, as Greenpeace research shows. Decontamination is impossible in forested areas. Anzai suffered skin pain, hair loss, headaches, strokes, and heart attacks, attributing them to "black snow" fallout. The government pressures returns, ended housing subsidies, and plans to release over a million tonnes of radioactive water into the ocean, worsening pollution. Anzai feels abandoned and angry.
