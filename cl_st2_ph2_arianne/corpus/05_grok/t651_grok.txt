At COP24 in Katowice, Poland, activists are shining a spotlight on the urgent need to phase out coal and transition to renewable energy sources, especially as climate impacts continue to worsen. One powerful voice comes from an Indonesian protester who shares the devastating effects of coal pollution on people's health and entire communities. She even climbed structures during the event to directly challenge climate denial, including that from her own father.

Meanwhile, residents from Imielin are actively resisting a proposed mine expansion that could lead to the collapse of their homes. Their struggle is gaining international attention and support, much like the protests seen in Germany's Hambach Forest.

Adding to these calls, a Silesian activist from a family with deep roots in coal mining is advocating for a just transition away from fossil fuels. She points out that wind energy has become more affordable than coal and is pressing Poland to take a leading role in climate action.
