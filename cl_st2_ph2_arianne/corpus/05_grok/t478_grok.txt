On International Women’s Day, we are calling for global support to urge Senegal's government to shut down fishmeal and fish oil factories. These factories are causing illness in areas like Gandiol, Joal, and Mbour, and they divert fish needed for local food and livelihoods to industrial feed.

African women activists, including Hindou Oumarou Ibrahim, Makenna Muigai, Thando Kimora, Wore Gana Seck, Awa Traore, and Fatou Samba, are highlighting women's vital roles in communities. They point to the industry's harm to economies, food security, marine ecosystems, and UN Sustainable Development Goals, amid overfishing and climate change.

These activists advocate reviewing legislation, protecting fish processors, and pledging to Stand 4 Women.
