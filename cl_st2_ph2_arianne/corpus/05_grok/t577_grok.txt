The deep sea holds vast, unexplored ecosystems teeming with unique species and serving as crucial stores of blue carbon. But deep sea mining poses a serious threat to all of this, with the potential to worsen climate change by releasing stored carbon and disrupting essential marine processes.

The risks are profound and far-reaching. Mining operations could cause irreversible damage to fragile habitats, while sediment plumes, pollution, noise, and light disturbances would harm wildlife, potentially leading to extinctions of species we've only just begun to discover.

Despite these dangers, companies are downplaying the threats and promoting deep sea mining as a "green solution" for sourcing minerals. Instead, we should be turning to alternatives like recycling to meet our needs without ravaging the ocean floor.

At Greenpeace, we're calling for a strong Global Ocean Treaty to safeguard international waters from such exploitation. Together, we can build a powerful movement to protect and restore healthy oceans for generations to come.
