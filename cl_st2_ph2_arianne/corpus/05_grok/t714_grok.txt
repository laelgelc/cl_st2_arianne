In the heart of Karimun Jawa, Indonesia, a national marine park teeming with turtles, sharks, and diverse fish species, lifelong fisherman Madjuri has witnessed devastating changes to his home. Once, locals like him could catch abundant fish right nearby, sustaining their communities. But now, coal barges are inflicting harm on this precious ecosystem.

These barges pollute the ocean with black runoff and emit smoky fumes that leave people coughing and vomiting. By anchoring, they destroy vital reefs, along with the traps and bait that fishers rely on. The barges scare away fish, and their bright lights attract and steal cuttlefish that local fishers would otherwise catch.

Despite repeated complaints to authorities, no action has been taken, leaving families' livelihoods at risk and the area's pristine nature endangered for future generations. Madjuri calls on everyone to stand against these destructive barges and protect what remains.
