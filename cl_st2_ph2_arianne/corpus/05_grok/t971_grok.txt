In a compelling 2014 lecture at the Oxford Martin School, Kumi Naidoo highlighted the vital role of civil disobedience in enabling the weak to challenge the strong amid social justice struggles and ecological crises. He drew on powerful historical examples, including Gandhi, Mandela, Rosa Parks, and the Quakers, to illustrate how such actions have driven change.

Naidoo explained how Greenpeace employs non-violent direct action to craft narratives that expose industrial destruction. This approach was evident in our confrontations with whaling fleets in 1975 and efforts to stop nuclear waste dumping in 1978. Through these actions, we shift public discourse, uncover lies, and harness the power of moral truth.

He emphasized that power often corrupts, leading to denials of harsh realities like climate change. In response, Naidoo stressed the need for action rather than just explanation to address these pressing issues.
