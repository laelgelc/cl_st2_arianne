The high seas are under serious threat from climate change, pollution, deep-sea mining, and destructive industrial fishing practices such as purse seining and bottom trawling. These activities are depleting fish stocks and causing harm to marine life.

A 2018 study shows that up to 54% of high seas fishing would be unprofitable without government subsidies and low labor costs. These low labor costs often stem from the exploitation of migrant fishers, including debt bondage, abuse, and long working hours. This was highlighted in a Taiwan court case involving the vessel Da Wang.

Illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing is making these environmental and human rights abuses even worse.

At Greenpeace, we urge companies to adopt ethical sourcing practices. We also encourage consumers to reduce their seafood intake and support sustainable, small-scale fisheries instead.
