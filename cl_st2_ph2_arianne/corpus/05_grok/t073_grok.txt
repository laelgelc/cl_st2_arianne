Rising fossil fuel prices are exacerbating energy poverty, making heating unaffordable for many while companies reap record profits. This situation highlights serious health risks, including higher hospital admissions and respiratory illnesses in children, as well as hypothermia and mental health issues in the elderly. Globally, indoor pollution causes 3.2 million deaths annually, and cold leads to 4.5 million deaths each year. Nearly 1 billion people lack access to electricity, with the problem worsening in regions like Sub-Saharan Africa. In Europe, up to 335,000 excess winter deaths could occur. To address this, taxing fossil profits is essential to fund support, building renovations, and renewable energy, ultimately ending dependence on fossil fuels.
