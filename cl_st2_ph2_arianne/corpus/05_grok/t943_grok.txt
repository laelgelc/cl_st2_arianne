In the vast expanse of the Pacific Ocean, high seas transshipping is enabling destructive practices that threaten our marine ecosystems and the people who depend on them. Motherships and refrigerated reefers allow fishing vessels to transfer their catches at sea, keeping these boats operational for months or even years without ever docking in ports.

This method opens the door to overfishing, illegal fishing, labor abuse, and the evasion of crucial regulations. Reports from the International Labour Organization (ILO) underscore the vulnerabilities faced by workers in these conditions, while an exposé by the Associated Press has revealed the grim reality of slave-caught fish entering global supply chains.

The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) recommends prohibiting transshipping at sea to address these issues. In Pacific fisheries, measures already include requirements for advance notice and a ban on the practice for purse seine vessels.

It's time to end transshipping altogether to safeguard our oceans, preserve tuna stocks, and protect the workers caught in this exploitative system.
