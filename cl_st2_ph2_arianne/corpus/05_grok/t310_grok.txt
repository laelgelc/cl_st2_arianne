One year has passed since the devastating 2020 Norilsk diesel spill in Russia's Arctic, and Greenpeace Russia is drawing attention to the persistent problem of oil accidents in the region. These include recent leaks in the Komi Republic and Nenets region. To promote transparency, Greenpeace Russia has mapped out Arctic oil storage facilities.

We welcome the inspections conducted by Rostekhnadzor, but we are calling for increased monitoring efforts, a phase-out of fossil fuels, and a transition to renewable energy sources. In reference to a 2018 presidential decree addressing aging infrastructure, we note that Norilsk Nickel was required to pay a historic compensation of 150 billion rubles.

With Russia currently chairing the Arctic Council, there is a key opportunity to advance a green economy through the proposed Russian Green Deal, which could generate jobs and help reduce the occurrence of spills.
