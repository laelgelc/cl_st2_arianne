Indigenous Peoples make up less than 5% of the global population but protect 80% of the world's biodiversity, even as they face rights violations and exclusion from decision-making processes.

At COP15, Indigenous leaders are sharing their experiences and calling for change. Valentin Engobo from the Democratic Republic of Congo emphasizes the role of community forestry and recent discoveries of peatlands that store vast amounts of carbon. Orpha from West Papua is fighting against oil palm plantations that clear forests without community consent. Adrienne Jerome from Canada is advocating for the protection of caribou in the face of industrial threats. Dinamam Tuxá from Brazil denounces policies that dispossess Indigenous territories.

COP15 must abandon colonial conservation models, ensure Indigenous participation, and recognize their rights to achieve effective biodiversity protection.
