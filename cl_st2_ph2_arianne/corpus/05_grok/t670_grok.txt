In the Philippines, a groundbreaking inquiry by the Commission on Human Rights is shining a light on the role of major oil, gas, coal, and cement companies like ExxonMobil, BP, Chevron, and Shell in driving climate change impacts. This effort stems from a 2015 petition, and at its heart are inspiring women who are leading the charge for accountability.

Desiree Llanos Dee is campaigning to bridge the gap between carbon producers and the real stories of affected communities. Her drive comes from participating in the 2015 Rome-to-Paris Climate Walk, which fueled her commitment to this cause.

Kristin Casper, a dedicated climate lawyer, is lending her expertise to support these global efforts, helping to amplify the voices calling for justice.

Among the powerful testimonies are those from survivors like Marielle Bacason, who was deeply traumatized by Super Typhoon Haiyan in 2013. Sharing her experiences, she underscores the urgent need for climate and gender justice.

Veronica “Derek” Cabe, affected by Typhoon Ketsana in 2009, also contributes her story, highlighting how these disasters have reshaped lives and the importance of holding companies accountable.

Through their shared testimonies, these women are pushing for responsibility from fossil fuel giants, all in the name of safeguarding future generations from the escalating impacts of climate change.
