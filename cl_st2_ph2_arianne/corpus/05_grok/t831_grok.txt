Corporations are increasingly using a troubling tactic known as SLAPPs—Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation—to intimidate and silence critics who speak out on environmental issues. These are meritless lawsuits designed to drain resources and deter public participation, and companies like Resolute Forest Products have employed them against organizations like ours.

In one instance, Resolute filed a CAD$7 million lawsuit in Canada against Greenpeace Canada. They also pursued a CAD$300 million lawsuit in the U.S. against various Greenpeace entities, Stand.earth, and individual activists, invoking RICO laws typically used against organized crime to allege fraud and racketeering.

This isn't isolated. In Uniontown, Alabama, local residents faced a USD$30 million lawsuit after raising concerns about a coal ash landfill. With assistance from the ACLU, they reached a settlement that included improved environmental protections for their community.

SLAPPs are on the rise, even in regions with anti-SLAPP laws intended to protect against such abuses.

To stand up against these tactics, remember the "Stand FIRM" approach: Fight back by defending your rights in court, Investigate the claims and gather evidence, Rally support from allies and communities, and Make noise to raise public awareness about the injustice.
