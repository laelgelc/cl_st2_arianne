The logging season in Germany has begun, putting forests like Dannenroder (Danni) under threat from highway expansion. Evictions and brutal tree cutting have occurred in nearby Herren and Maulbacher forests, with chainsaws approaching Danni. We call for support through following news, providing aid, and social media sharing under #Dannibleibt. The project is hypocritical amid climate crisis and mass extinction, destroying ancient trees, endangered species, and a water reserve while promoting polluting cars. Activists have built treehouse villages in resistance, facing police evictions, as hundreds mobilize for climate justice.
