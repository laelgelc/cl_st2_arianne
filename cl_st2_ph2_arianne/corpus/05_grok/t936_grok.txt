Today is World Food Day, and here at Greenpeace, we're joining food lovers around the globe in celebrating the power of good food. We believe that organic, local, seasonal food—food that's good for people and the planet—is a human right. It should be accessible to everyone, from farmers in Argentina to city dwellers in France, children in the Philippines, and foodies in the USA.

That's why we're calling on governments to step up and make ecological food available at fair prices, both for consumers and the farmers who produce it.

But change starts with us. While we push for systemic shifts, there are plenty of ways you can take personal action to celebrate and support a better food system. Here are five fun ideas to get you started:

- Buy ecological produce and distribute it in your community.

- Host meals using ecological ingredients.

- Cook with ecological food for those in need.

- Volunteer at local farms or community gardens.

- Pursue further actions to help reform the food system.
