Greenpeace is thrilled to celebrate a major victory, thanks to the incredible efforts of 526,000 supporters who forced Volkswagen (VW) to reverse its opposition to EU laws mandating more efficient cars. These laws will reduce CO2 emissions and oil dependence.

For two years, VW had been lobbying against strong targets. But our campaign changed that. A viral Star Wars parody ad captured widespread attention, while protests by activists dressed as stormtroopers and direct actions at car shows ramped up the pressure on VW.

This push led VW to support climate goals. The result cuts pollution linked to climate change and helps protect areas like the Arctic. It also signals the end of inefficient combustion engines, with VW committing to be the world's greenest car company.
