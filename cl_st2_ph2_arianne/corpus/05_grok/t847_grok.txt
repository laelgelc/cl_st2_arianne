The global water crisis stands out as the top risk facing our planet, fueled by pollution from bacteria, toxins, and nutrient loading. At Greenpeace, we're highlighting solutions through bioremediation, which harnesses natural systems such as plants, microbes, and fungi to clean contaminated water and soil. This approach draws on historical examples from farming and permaculture, where these methods have long been used to restore ecosystems.

Bioremediation ties into biomimicry, where innovations are inspired by nature—think of Velcro, modeled after burrs sticking to fabric. However, we must critique the neoliberal applications of biomimicry that often prioritize profit over genuine restoration efforts.

Real-world case studies demonstrate the power of these techniques. In Lake Winnipeg, cattail planting has helped address pollution issues. John Todd's Living Machines use integrated living systems to treat wastewater effectively. Paul Stamets' mycofiltration employs fungi to filter out contaminants from water. And the Loess Plateau's ecological rehabilitation showcases large-scale restoration through natural methods.

These examples underscore the importance of natural economics and respecting planetary boundaries to tackle the water crisis sustainably.
