Forest fires are raging across over five million hectares in Siberia, with less than 90% of them being managed. A Greenpeace Russia team recently documented the catastrophe in the Krasnoyarsk region, where they interviewed locals who are enduring thick smoke that causes headaches, respiratory issues, and health risks from toxins and carcinogens. Residents, including children, are suffering both indoors and out, with no escape as the haze blankets vast areas. These fires are burning in "zones of control" where extinguishing them is optional. A Greenpeace petition, which has gathered over 400,000 signatures, has prompted proposed law changes to shrink these zones, boost fire protection budgets, and avert future wildfires, which would save forests and reduce CO2 emissions.
