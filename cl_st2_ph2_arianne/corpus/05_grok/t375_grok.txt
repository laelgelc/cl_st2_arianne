The deep ocean is a mysterious realm, home to ancient coral reefs, towering underwater mountains, and long-lived sea creatures that hold vital clues to the very origins of life on Earth. Yet, this fragile ecosystem is now under threat from a new industry eager to mine the seabed purely for corporate profit.

Scientists are sounding the alarm, warning that such deep-sea mining could inflict irreversible damage on marine life and disrupt essential carbon-storing processes in the ocean, ultimately worsening the climate crisis we're already facing.

As negotiations continue for a Global Ocean Treaty aimed at safeguarding these waters, the mining industry is actively lobbying governments to push their agenda forward. Shockingly, an area equivalent in size to France and Germany combined has already been opened up for exploration.

Greenpeace investigations have uncovered a troubling network of companies based in the Global North that are putting sponsoring states in the Global South at significant risk, directly contradicting the industry's own claims of responsibility and safety.

Activists are standing firm against this exploitation, calling instead for robust protection of our oceans. Join the movement by watching Ocean Witness and adding your voice to support the Global Ocean Treaty.
