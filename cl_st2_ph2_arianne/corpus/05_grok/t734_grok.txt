Across the globe, diverse communities are turning to the courts to demand climate justice. Lavender farmers in France, beekeepers in Portugal, Romanian shepherds, Kenyan school children, Swedish Sámi youth, and islanders in Germany and Fiji are among those pursuing legal actions to address the climate crisis.

In Switzerland, the group Senior Women for Climate Protection is suing the government, calling for stronger reductions in greenhouse gas emissions to safeguard vulnerable elderly people from the impacts of extreme heat. A court decision on this case is pending.

Meanwhile, in Norway, Greenpeace Nordic and Nature and Youth are appealing against the granting of Arctic oil licenses, highlighting the importance of rights to a healthy environment.

Families from various countries have also taken legal action against the European Union, arguing that its weak emission targets infringe on fundamental rights to life, health, occupation, and property.

In the Netherlands, the landmark Urgenda case has already mandated ambitious climate action from the government, with an appeal set to be heard soon.
