At an OSPAR meeting in Gothenburg, delegates from 15 European countries are discussing the establishment of a pie-shaped Arctic Marine Protected Area in international waters north of Greenland. This proposed area, comparable in size to the UK, is vital for ice-dependent species like polar bears, walruses, and harp seals. The Arctic is experiencing rapid warming and sea ice melt, which could lead to ice-free summers by 2030.

Currently, less than 1.5% of the Arctic Ocean is protected, and none of that protection extends to international waters. Norway, Iceland, and Denmark have resisted the proposal, citing technical issues, though the proposal has since improved.

Greenpeace is hosting an exhibition to urge delegates to finalize this protection for future generations. This effort is backed by over seven million supporters. We invite you to sign a declaration in support.
