2018 has been declared the climate year, marked by devastating fires, soaring temperatures, powerful hurricanes, and the IPCC's confirmation that our changing world is set to worsen in the years ahead. Amid these urgent signals, the Climate Vulnerable Forum’s Virtual Summit, hosted by the Marshall Islands, is highlighting leadership from vulnerable developing countries. This includes the Marshall Islands' ambitious plan to achieve 100% renewables and net-zero emissions by 2050.

The CVF, made up of frontline nations, played a key role in influencing the Paris Agreement and the critical 1.5-degree goal. As an online event, this summit comes just before COP24, calling on major polluters and governments worldwide to take urgent action on climate change.
