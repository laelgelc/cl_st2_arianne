In our latest report, "Justice for People and Planet," Greenpeace highlights 20 case studies that reveal corporate abuses impacting human and environmental rights. These include instances of deforestation, pollution, and violations of Indigenous rights.

The report points to governance gaps in global economic rules as key factors enabling these abuses. Such gaps are the result of political choices and corporate capture of institutions.

To address these issues, the report puts forward 10 Principles for Corporate Accountability. These principles prioritize people and the environment over corporations, and call for binding rules, due diligence, transparency, liability, access to remedy, and enforcement.

The report also features positive examples of progress, such as France's risk prevention laws, Switzerland's referendum, and the UK's Modern Slavery Act.

At Greenpeace, we expose corporate misdeeds while praising positive corporate actions and offering alternatives to drive change.
