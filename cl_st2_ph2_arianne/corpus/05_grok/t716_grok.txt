As we reflect on 2017, all of us at Greenpeace International want to start by expressing our deepest gratitude to our supporters. Your unwavering commitment has been our backbone, especially in the face of lawsuits totaling over a billion dollars from companies like Resolute Forest Products and Energy Transfer Partners. These legal actions are clearly designed to silence our activism, but together, we've stood strong.

This year has been marked by inspiring global achievements that show the power of collective action. Our Make SMTHNG week events brought people together worldwide to promote creation over consumption, sparking creativity and challenging the throwaway culture. We've ramped up pressure on Thai Union through dedicated campaigns, pushing for more sustainable fisheries practices. In Europe, our petition against glyphosate in the EU gathered massive support, amplifying voices for safer alternatives. In Brazil, efforts to protect the Amazon have gained ground, safeguarding vital ecosystems. And we're thrilled with Samsung's policy shift regarding Galaxy phones, a win for more responsible electronics.

At Greenpeace, we're committed to fostering diversity and inclusion within our organization, and we've integrated the principles of the #MeToo movement to create a safer, more equitable space for everyone.

Behind the scenes, so much of our work goes unseen but is essential to our impact. This includes meticulous campaign planning, rigorous training programs, expert scientific support, and the management of our ships that enable on-the-ground investigations and actions.

We're celebrating key successes that are driving real change: coal phase-outs in various regions, growing divestment from fossil fuels, and our work in exposing unfair trade deals that harm the environment and communities.

Looking ahead, we urge everyone to continue collaborating with us. Together, we can build a more sustainable planet for all.
