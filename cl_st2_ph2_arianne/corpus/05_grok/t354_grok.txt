The fight against the climate crisis is deeply connected to global equality, with women's powerful global engagement playing a key role in advancing climate and environmental protection. This post features women from Greenpeace worldwide who share insights into their daily work and the changes they wish to see, celebrating their contributions on International Women’s Day and beyond. Here, the term 'women' includes trans, non-binary, and cisgender individuals. We invite readers to share their own inspirations and to watch 50 video messages highlighting these efforts.

Among those featured are Elena Keil, a Project Assistant; Anabela Angelovska, a content producer and filmmaker; and Karla Stretz, an online-editor—all from Greenpeace Germany's “50 Years Greenpeace International” team.
