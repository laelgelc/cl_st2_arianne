Industrial fishing fleets that target squid are causing widespread devastation to marine wildlife, including sharks, rays, and dolphins. This activity is also harming coastal communities and sustainable fishers, particularly in regions like the Indian Ocean.

A recent Greenpeace report highlights how the rapid growth of the squid industry is posing a serious threat to global ecosystems. In the North-West Indian Ocean, the number of vessels has surged by over 800% in just five years. Meanwhile, in the South-West Atlantic, armadas exceeding 500 vessels are operating.

The lack of regulation in international waters is enabling this unchecked industrialization of fishing practices.

To address these issues, a strong Global Ocean Treaty is urgently required. Such a treaty would help regulate fisheries, establish ocean sanctuaries, and safeguard the oceans to support climate stability, healthy ecosystems, food security, and livelihoods.

Nearly five million people have already signed a petition calling for this critical action.
