Every year, around 100 million sharks are killed, leading to a staggering 70% decline in shark populations over the past 50 years. While shark fin soup often takes the blame, this narrow focus misrepresents the true drivers behind the crisis. The reality is a much broader $1 billion global market for shark meat, oil, and cartilage, fueled by destructive fishing methods such as purse seine nets, longlines, and trawling. These practices occur in numerous countries, including France, Spain, Iran, Sri Lanka, South Korea, Japan, China, and the US.

Singling out one dish like shark fin soup unfairly targets specific cultural groups and overlooks the widespread exploitation of sharks for various products. To address this, effective solutions must include implementing catch limits, protecting 30% of the oceans by 2030, establishing global shark sanctuaries, and enforcing import regulations.

Sharks play a vital role in maintaining ocean health, and at Greenpeace, we're committed to raising awareness about these issues to drive real change.
