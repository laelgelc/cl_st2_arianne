The fight against illegal logging continues, showing some progress but facing ongoing challenges, including corruption in timber-producing countries. In the Congo Basin, vast forests are being cleared for agriculture, resulting in "conversion timber" that's often suspect and ends up in the hands of importers such as those in the EU.

Our Greenpeace report, "Trading in Chaos," uncovers the disarray in the Democratic Republic of Congo's (DRC) logging sector. Companies like Cotrefor are exporting illegal wood while failing to honor contracts with local communities.

Similarly, Global Witness's "Blood Timber" investigation exposes how some firms are financing rebel groups through the trade in conflict timber, which finds its way to markets in the EU and China.

According to Chatham House, illegal timber trade has remained stagnant despite various reforms. China stands out as the largest importer and processor of such timber, with emerging markets in India, South Korea, and Vietnam also on the rise.

Strong enforcement of regulations like the EU Timber Regulation (EUTR) and the Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade (FLEGT) initiative is essential to safeguard communities, preserve biodiversity, and protect our vital forests.
