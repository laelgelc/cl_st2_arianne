Sophie Marjanac, an environmental lawyer with Client Earth, grew up in the Blue Mountains, which shaped her early connection to nature. Her path to environmental law began through university activism and later involved land rights work with Indigenous Australians. She stresses the deep connection between protecting the environment and upholding human rights.

Marjanac points to a growing wave of climate lawsuits targeting governments and fossil fuel companies. These efforts draw inspiration from landmark cases like Urgenda in the Netherlands, where citizens successfully challenged their government on climate inaction. Even with setbacks in some legal battles, she urges persistence in the fight for climate justice.

She highlights the groundbreaking investigation by the Philippines' Commission on Human Rights into the human rights impacts of major carbon-emitting companies. For those facing challenges in this work, Marjanac advises connecting with networks of environmental defenders for support.

Despite the obstacles, she finds hope in the passion of young people who are demanding urgent action on climate change.
