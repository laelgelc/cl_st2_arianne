The International Whaling Commission (IWC) is currently holding its biennial meeting in Brazil, where government delegates and NGOs like Greenpeace come together to address critical issues surrounding whales and ocean conservation.

At the heart of the discussions is a deeply polarized debate on whaling. Pro-whaling nations are pushing to undermine the longstanding ban on commercial whaling, especially in light of recent controversy surrounding Iceland's killing of hybrid blue whales.

Two competing visions for the IWC's future are on the table. Japan's 'Way Forward' proposal aims to legitimize commercial whaling, while Brazil's 'Florianopolis Declaration' seeks to shift the focus toward conservation and the essential role whales play in healthy oceans.

Additionally, a proposed South Atlantic Whale Sanctuary is encountering political resistance from some quarters.

Greenpeace experts are actively defending the commercial whaling ban, supporting the establishment of the sanctuary, and advocating for an IWC that prioritizes conservation above all.
