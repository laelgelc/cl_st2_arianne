Illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing is a billion-dollar industry riddled with murder, slavery, corruption, and deception. Sea Shepherd's 110-day chase of a notorious poaching vessel shines a light on the lengths needed to combat this shadowy trade. Each year, 8-14 million metric tons of illegal fish enter the market, valued at $9-17 billion, with $2.4 billion worth imported into the U.S. in 2019 alone.

Fishery observers play a perilous role in this fight, as captured in the documentary "Murder at Sea," which delves into the dangers they face while monitoring illegal activities on the high seas. Human rights abuses, including modern slavery, are rampant in the industry, as portrayed in films like "Buoyancy" and "Ghost Fleet." The latter highlights the work of activist Patima Tungpuchayakula, who has been instrumental in rescuing enslaved workers from fishing vessels.
