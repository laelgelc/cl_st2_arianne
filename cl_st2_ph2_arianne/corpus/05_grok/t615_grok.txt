Greenpeace is setting off on an ambitious pole-to-pole expedition aboard our ship Esperanza, with the mission to expose the threats facing our oceans, confront environmental destruction head-on, and champion the solutions needed to protect them. Kicking off in the Arctic, we'll be working alongside scientists to investigate how climate change is impacting marine life. Along the way, we'll document critical issues, from the shrinking sea ice that's endangering polar bears to the plastic pollution choking the Sargasso Sea, illegal fishing in the South Atlantic, and the risks posed by deep-sea mining to the unique Lost City hydrothermal field.

This voyage will shine a spotlight on the diverse ecosystems and wildlife that make our oceans so vital, from pole to pole. It's all in support of our #ProtectTheOceans campaign, pushing for a strong Global Ocean Treaty that would safeguard at least a third of the world's seas by 2030.
