Greenpeace International has joined forces with 350 organizations to denounce the Food and Agriculture Organization's (FAO) recent agreement with CropLife International. CropLife International is a lobby group representing pesticide and genetically engineered seed corporations, including Bayer, BASF, and Syngenta.

The agreement is intended to transform agri-food systems, promote rural development, and enhance farmer resilience to climate change by focusing on investment and innovation.

However, critics contend that this partnership empowers profit-driven multinationals, providing them with undue legitimacy and influence over global food systems. It overlooks vital approaches like agroecology and food sovereignty, as well as the recommendations outlined in the 2009 International Assessment of Agricultural Knowledge, Science and Technology for Development (IAASTD).

We urge the FAO to prioritize ecological farming over corporate interests to ensure a healthy planet.
