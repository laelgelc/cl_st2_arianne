Vital Ocean Voices is a series that brings to light stories from coastal communities in the Indian Ocean, focusing on the impacts of destructive fishing, pollution, and climate breakdown. In this installment, we share the experience of Kokoly, a respected octopus gleaner from Madagascar's Vezo seafaring people. Her livelihood, like that of many in her community, depends entirely on the sea.

Living amid extreme poverty, Kokoly has witnessed a stark decline in marine resources due to overfishing and habitat destruction. She notes that there are far fewer fish and sharks now compared to her youth. These challenges extend across Vezo communities, which are often overlooked in global discussions.

The film emphasizes women's perspectives, shedding light on their struggles for survival. For more information, explore the links to additional resources and the work of Blue Ventures.
