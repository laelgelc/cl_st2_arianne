The time has come to accelerate the shift to reuse and refill systems as a critical step in combating plastic pollution. This urgency is driven by growing global pressure and is increasingly supported by forward-thinking policies around the world.

A recent report from the Ellen MacArthur Foundation underscores the insufficient ambition for reuse within the consumer goods sector, highlighting the need for greater commitment to make these systems mainstream.

Meanwhile, the World Economic Forum has launched an initiative that brings together stakeholders to advocate for policies that enable and promote reuse.

By scaling up reuse, we can unlock significant environmental and economic benefits. For instance, in the food and beverage sector alone, this could save 27.1 million tonnes of resources by 2030.

To drive this transformation, we need a binding Global Plastics Treaty that reduces plastic production and actively promotes reuse. Progressive laws in countries like Austria, France, Portugal, Romania, Spain, Chile, India, and Indonesia are already setting examples, demonstrating how policy can support the transition to reuse and refill systems.

Let's build on this momentum to end plastic pollution for good.
