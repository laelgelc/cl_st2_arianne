Over the past two years, Greenpeace has been campaigning aboard our ship, the Esperanza, to shine a spotlight on the incredible wonders of the Amazon Reef and safeguard it from oil drilling threats posed by companies like Total. Joined by more than 2 million Amazon Reef Defenders from around the world—including scientists and local communities—we've secured a historic victory. Brazil's environmental agency, Ibama, has denied Total's license to drill in the area.

Our efforts included everything from capturing the very first images of this unique reef to disrupting a Total company meeting. This triumph over a major oil giant is a powerful sign of the expanding global movement to bring the oil age to an end. Yet, the battle isn't over—we must keep pushing for complete protection of the reef.

To all our supporters: you are the true heroes in this fight.
