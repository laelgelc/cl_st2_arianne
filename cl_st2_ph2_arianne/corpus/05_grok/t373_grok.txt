As we reflect on 2020, the year has brought a stark reminder of the intensifying climate emergencies unfolding across the globe. From devastating hurricanes to relentless wildfires and floods, these events underscore the urgent need for collective action to combat climate change.

In the United States, Hurricane Laura unleashed widespread destruction, resulting in deaths and leaving millions without power. Meanwhile, Siberia experienced severe heat waves, compounded by oil spills and raging forest fires that ravaged vast areas.

The Amazon rainforest faced a dire threat from extensive fires, which not only endangered this vital ecosystem but also contributed to rising global temperatures. In California, prolonged fire seasons destroyed lives and ecosystems, with flames consuming homes, wildlife habitats, and communities.

The Philippines endured back-to-back typhoons that triggered massive floods and displaced countless people, prompting urgent calls for a declaration of climate emergency.

Even amid a global pandemic that led to temporary reductions in emissions, 2020 stands as one of the hottest years on record. The year was also marked by catastrophic Australian bushfires, alongside devastating floods in Kenya, Japan, China, Indonesia, and South Korea, which caused numerous deaths and inflicted massive damage on infrastructure and livelihoods.

These events demand that we come together now to address the root causes of climate change and build a more resilient future for all.
