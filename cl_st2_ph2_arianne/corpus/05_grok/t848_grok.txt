As a Press Officer with Greenpeace Russia, I'm deeply committed to protecting our environment. I have a profound love for the Great Northern Forest, with its wild beauty, its crucial role in combating climate change, and its importance as a habitat for species like bears and endangered reindeer.

Yet, as a consumer, I can't help but doubt the everyday products I use, knowing they might be linked to the destruction of these vital forests.

Our investigations have uncovered that Russian companies, including Pomor Timber, Arkhangelsk Pulp and Paper Mill, and Titan Group, are logging in the unprotected Dvinsky Forest. At this rate, the forest could be lost in a decade. These companies supply major brands such as Nestlé, PepsiCo, and McDonald’s.

At Greenpeace, we're urging these companies to end their unsustainable practices. We need your help—please sign our petition to save the Dvinsky Forest.
