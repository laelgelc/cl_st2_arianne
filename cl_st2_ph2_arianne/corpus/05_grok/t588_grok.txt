In 2018, the removal of Amsterdam's iconic 'Iamsterdam' sign shocked tourists and locals alike, capturing global media attention. This event draws a striking parallel to the disappearing Amazon rainforest, where we've repurposed the sign as 'Iamazonia' to spotlight the ongoing deforestation and to stand in solidarity with Indigenous Peoples. These communities have long protected the forest and depend on it for their survival.

We criticize Brazil's Bolsonaro government for promoting industrial exploitation of the Amazon through agriculture, mining, and logging. This has resulted in increased invasions, violence against local communities, and heightened risks to the global climate.

We urge people worldwide to join in supporting efforts to safeguard this vital planetary landmark.
