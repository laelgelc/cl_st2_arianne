Carbon offsetting is nothing more than a scam and a greenwashing tool that lets companies and governments keep polluting while pretending to reduce emissions through projects like forest protection. These schemes commodify nature, harm Indigenous communities, and distract from the real need for actual emission cuts.

Net zero is a deceptive bookkeeping trick that relies on offsets, completely ignoring the urgent requirement for immediate reductions in fossil fuel use. Instead, we need to push for 'real zero' emissions.

This whole offsetting con is driven by greed, feigning compassion, preying on fear, and exploiting uncertainty. It's time to reject it outright at COP26 and under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement.
