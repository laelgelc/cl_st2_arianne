In Russia, a law prohibits women from working as professional firefighters, yet determined women are stepping up as volunteers with Greenpeace Russia to tackle devastating forest fires. These fires are intensifying, particularly in areas like Transbaikalia, where pine forests ignite rapidly under harsh conditions fueled by climate change.

Our volunteers come from diverse backgrounds, including students and women approaching 50, who juggle firefighting duties with their regular jobs. They receive essential training and focus on abilities rather than gender distinctions.

Among them, Sofya Kosacheva has led firefighting expeditions, demonstrating her leadership in the field. Anna Baskakova founded a firefighting group, showcasing her initiative and commitment. Anastasia Ivashkevich has proven her skills through hands-on firefighting, challenging stereotypes along the way.

Beyond direct firefighting, these women engage in preventive measures, such as planting trees and raising awareness about risks like dry grass burning, contributing to broader efforts to protect Russia's forests.
