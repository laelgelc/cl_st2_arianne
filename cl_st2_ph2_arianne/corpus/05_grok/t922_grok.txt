Greenpeace is thrilled to be collaborating with Italy's Prato textile district to push forward our Detox campaign. This effort targets suppliers for major brands like Gucci, Prada, and Armani, aiming to clean up the fashion industry's chemical footprint.

Already, twenty companies in the district have stepped up by joining the initiative. They're committing to eliminate hazardous chemicals from their processes, including PFCs, flame retardants, organotin compounds, and amines released from azo dyes—all of which can harm human health.

Confindustria Toscana Nord is playing a key role, investing in better tracking, greater transparency, and solid action plans to detoxify products. These steps are not just local; they're poised to influence global supply chains for the better.

By taking this bold stand, Prato is setting a new standard in the textile world and challenging big brands to step up and follow suit.

We're calling on more companies to pledge to Detox by 2020. And to consumers: demand chemical-free fashion from the brands you love. Together, we can look forward to cleaner air and rivers as a result of these changes.
