On May 29, a diesel oil tank burst at the Nadezhda plant on Russia's Taymyr peninsula, spilling over 20,000 tonnes of oil into local waterways. The spill contaminated 20km of the area, turning the Ambarnaya River red as it flows toward the sea. This major Arctic spill occurred at a facility operated by a division of Nornickel in the polluted city of Norilsk. The incident was discovered late through media reports, which prompted anger from Putin and led to the declaration of a state of emergency.

Greenpeace estimates the damages from this spill exceed RUB 10 billion. Companies often evade liability in such cases and exploit the Covid situation to weaken environmental laws. This event highlights the risks associated with fossil fuels in the Arctic region. We urge the government to conduct audits, implement frequent inspections, and introduce a green recovery package to support a just transition away from oil.
