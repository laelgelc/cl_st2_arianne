In 1976, Shell built the Brent Spar, an oil storage tank in the North Sea that became redundant by 1980. It contained crude oil, PCBs, heavy metals, and radioactive waste. By 1991, Shell had planned to dump the structure in the North Sea, securing approval from the UK government as a cost-saving test case for such disposals.

Greenpeace stepped in with a major campaign in 1995. Our activists occupied the Brent Spar, took samples of its contents, and rallied against the dumping with the powerful slogan "The sea is not a dustbin." The effort gained widespread media coverage, sparked boycotts, and drew international pressure, ultimately forcing Shell to abandon the plan. Instead, the company towed the spar to a mooring in Norway.

This turnaround paved the way for the 1998 OSPAR ban on dumping similar structures in the North Sea. The Brent Spar itself was eventually repurposed as the foundation for a ferry terminal, standing as a landmark victory for Greenpeace in the fight to protect our oceans.
