On the seventh anniversary of the Fukushima nuclear accident, Greenpeace expresses sympathies and highlights ongoing radiation risks in contaminated areas like Namie and Obori, where hot spots exceed safe levels, potentially exposing people to annual limits in days. The Japanese government plans to reopen these zones by 2023 to facilitate nuclear reactor restarts, despite high contamination persisting for decades. Evacuee Mrs. Mizue Kanno shares her story of displacement and activism against nuclear power, joining lawsuits against TEPCO and the government. Greenpeace's survey report underscores the need for precautions. Upcoming UN sessions and court rulings aim to enforce human rights and promote renewables.
