Luís Ferreirim, Head of Agriculture at Greenpeace Spain, is facing a lawsuit from Valle de Odieta S.C.L. after he criticized their factory farms. This includes their massive dairy operation in Caparroso, which holds 7,200 cows, and a planned mega farm in Noviercas that would house 23,520 cows.

Factory farms like these across Europe are harming the environment, the climate, animals, and small farmers. In the EU, the number of farms is declining even as meat production continues to rise.

This lawsuit is a SLAPP, designed to silence critics, and it follows similar cases in Spain.

Ferreirim is refusing to retract his statements, pointing to the company's violations, which include animal mistreatment, unauthorized expansions, and a toxic spill in the Aragón River.

He is calling on everyone to share this story, switch to plant-based diets, and demand that governments support sustainable farming to put an end to factory farms.
