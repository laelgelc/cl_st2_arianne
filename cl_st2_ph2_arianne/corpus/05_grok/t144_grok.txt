Greenpeace Brazil has embarked on a month-long expedition starting from Manaus, delving into the rich biodiversity of the Amazon in the Manicoré River region. This journey is dedicated to supporting local communities in their ongoing struggle to protect their lands.

Even as we grapple with the tragic disappearance and confirmed deaths of Bruno Araújo Pereira and Dom Phillips, our team presses forward. We're committed to honoring their legacies by advancing a vision for an Amazon that is sustainable and respects the rights of all, standing firmly against government neglect and the violence that plagues the region.

During the expedition, ornithologists have documented the "Chico’s tyrannulet," a bird species named in tribute to the renowned activist Chico Mendes, spotted in a new habitat further north.

Through this effort, we're calling for justice, continued resistance, and widespread public support to protect the forest and the peoples who depend on it.
