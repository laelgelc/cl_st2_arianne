In the fight for a sustainable and equitable world, the intersections between LGBT rights and climate justice reveal how interconnected our struggles truly are. Oppressions are linked, and true advocacy means addressing multiple identities to build a just society.

This connection comes to life through the personal stories of LGBT survivors from Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines. Arthur overcame discrimination to lead relief efforts, turning personal challenges into community action. Nityalila, a musician, uses her voice to raise awareness and came out after confronting the impacts of climate disasters. Pierce gained insights into intersectionality and privilege by witnessing the horrific experiences of others.

Contributors like Edwin Nichols underscore the power of community, drawing parallels to the Stonewall riots and urging solidarity in the face of discrimination and climate crises.
