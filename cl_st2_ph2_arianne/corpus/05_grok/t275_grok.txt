In our Vital Ocean Voices series, we're shining a spotlight on the dedicated individuals working to protect our oceans. Today, we profile 25-year-old Athina Antoine, a team member with the Reef Rescuers program at Nature Seychelles. Athina is part of the effort to restore coral reefs on Cousin Island Special Reserve, a critical site for marine conservation.

Each day, Athina and her team head out to collect fragments of Pocillopora coral. They break these fragments into smaller nubbins and attach them to ropes suspended in midwater nurseries. There, they monitor the corals' growth, regularly cleaning off biofouling to ensure healthy development. After 9-12 months, the team transplants the grown corals back onto the reef using the reef gardening method.

These restoration efforts are vital in the face of coral bleaching caused by ocean warming and pollution. Coral reefs are essential for Seychelles' fisheries, tourism, and broader ecosystem services, supporting marine life and coastal communities.

Athina shares her hope that her work will inspire more young people to get involved in ocean conservation, helping to build a new generation of protectors for our seas.
