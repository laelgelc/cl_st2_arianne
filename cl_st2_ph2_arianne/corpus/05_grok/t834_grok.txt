Greenpeace's global forest campaign is all about putting pressure on companies to step up and protect our precious forests. We've seen real successes from this approach, including protections secured in places like Canada, Brazil, and Indonesia.

Right now, our Great Northern Forest campaign is focusing on the destruction of boreal forests in Russia's Arkhangelsk region. We've released a report that exposes how FSC-certified companies are logging Intact Forest Landscapes there.

Even FSC Russia recognizes that the industry needs to transform and that customer pressure is key to making the Dvinsky Forest Reserve a reality.

That's why Greenpeace is calling on companies such as Pomor Timber, Titan, and Arkhangelsk Pulp & Paper to support the reserve by June 2017. If they don't act, they could face contract suspensions and boycotts.
