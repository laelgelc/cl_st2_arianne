Elisabeth Stern, a member of the Swiss Senior Women for Climate Protection, has voiced strong outrage over the condemnation faced by young climate activists, even as those profiting from fossil fuels continue to thrive without repercussions. She points out the growing pessimism among young people regarding their ability to adapt to the impacts of climate change, and she underscores their urgent pleas for action that bridges generations.

Motivated not by her own survival but by deep concern for the generations to come, Stern shares her personal commitment to this cause, which dates back to 1977. She emphasizes the power of climate litigation as a means to hold both states and companies accountable for their roles in the crisis.

The group's ongoing lawsuit before the European Court of Human Rights aims to establish climate protection as a fundamental human right, a step that would particularly support young people grappling with profound existential concerns about the future.
