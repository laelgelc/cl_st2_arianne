Activists are taking a stand against Mitsubishi UFJ, protesting the bank's continued funding of new coal projects even as it invests in renewables, and Greenpeace is shining a spotlight on their efforts.

It's time for everyone to take a closer look at where their money is going—whether through banks, pensions, or insurance—and make the shift to a low-carbon economy. This transition presents $89 trillion in opportunities, with clean energy already outperforming fossil fuels.

The financial system remains opaque, making it challenging to track these investments. That's why we encourage people to explore sustainable indexes and engage in shareholder activism to drive change.

Greenpeace stands in solidarity with activists around the world pushing for a better future. As demands for transparency in finance continue to grow, it's clear that $5 trillion is still tied up in fossil fuels. However, progress is happening: 884 institutions, representing $6 trillion, have already divested from coal, paving the way for a clean energy transition.
