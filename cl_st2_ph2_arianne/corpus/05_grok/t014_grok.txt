Throwaway plastic is destroying our world in devastating ways. It harms human health, accelerates social injustice, destroys biodiversity, and fuels the climate crisis. We need a human rights-based approach that prioritizes health, the environment, and justice for affected communities.

At Greenpeace, we're demanding a Global Plastics Treaty that keeps oil and gas in the ground, ends relentless plastic production, and phases out single-use plastics for a safer future. However, industry and government efforts are trying to weaken this treaty.

That's why we're building a global movement to secure an ambitious agreement by 2024—one that caps production, phases out virgin plastics, and ensures a just transition to a zero-waste economy.
