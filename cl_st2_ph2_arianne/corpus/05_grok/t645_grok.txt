In 2018, the world faced a barrage of climate disasters, from devastating floods and droughts to raging wildfires, powerful cyclones, and rising sea levels. These crises stemmed from leaders' inaction or ignorance, which blocked vital solutions such as transitioning to renewables and implementing protections. Such failures amounted to nothing less than mass murder on a global scale.

Yet, amid the gloom, there were glimmers of hope. Renewable energy was gaining ground with significant adoption in China, the US, and India. Efforts to establish an Antarctic sanctuary came close to success, incorporating sustainable krill harvesting and marine protections. Industries were shifting too, with reforms in tuna fishing and palm oil production showing progress. Youth-led movements were driving change, alongside legal victories against governments and fossil fuel companies. Campaigns against overconsumption were also making strides.

It's time to join the truth-sayers and fight for a green future. We have just 12 years to act against the ongoing threats of fossil fuels, deforestation, and overfishing.
