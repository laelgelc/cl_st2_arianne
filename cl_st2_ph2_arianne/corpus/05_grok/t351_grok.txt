Ten years have passed since the Fukushima nuclear disaster, unleashed by a devastating tsunami that struck Japan. This catastrophe echoes the shock of events like 9/11, the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, and the Chernobyl meltdown, each leaving indelible marks on history.

For the survivors, the trauma lingers deeply. Mass evacuations displaced communities, and radiation contamination spread across the region, creating long-term challenges.

Diving into Greenpeace's archives from 2011 to 2019 reveals the enduring impact. A decade proves too short to heal the wounds or erase the pain inflicted on people and the environment.

Through visual documentations captured in Japanese prefectures, we see the persistent presence of radiation, a stark reminder of the disaster's reach.

At Greenpeace, we commit to bearing witness to these realities, ensuring the world does not forget. Our efforts drive the call for a nuclear-free world, where such tragedies are prevented for future generations.
