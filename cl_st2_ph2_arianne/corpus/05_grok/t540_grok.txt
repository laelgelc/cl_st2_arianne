The latest IPCC report underscores a critical truth: the climate crisis is fundamentally an oceans crisis. Healthy oceans are essential for providing food, regulating our climate, and storing carbon, yet they are under severe threat.

Rising CO2 emissions are driving ocean warming, melting ice, rising sea levels, and ocean acidification. These changes are inflicting serious harm on vital ecosystems, including coral reefs. The situation is worsened by human activities such as overfishing, deep-sea drilling, and plastic pollution, which compound the damage to marine life.

To address this, governments worldwide must make UN negotiations a top priority and push for a robust Global Ocean Treaty. This treaty would establish ocean sanctuaries that protect at least 30% of the world's oceans by 2030, giving marine ecosystems a chance to recover and thrive.

At the same time, leaders need to speed up the transition to renewable energy sources, put an end to deforestation, and commit to reducing emissions to zero.
