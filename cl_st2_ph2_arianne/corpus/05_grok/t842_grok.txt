Oceans are the origin of all life on Earth, and they've been our planet's unsung heroes in the fight against climate change. Over the past 60 years, they've absorbed 90% of the excess heat generated by greenhouse gas emissions, sparing us from what could have been a catastrophic 36°C rise in global temperatures.

These vast waters don't just buffer heat—they provide us with oxygen, food, and essential climate regulation. Yet, they're under immense strain from industrial fishing and pollution, pushing them to their limits.

For healthier oceans and a thriving planet, we need to act now: create ocean sanctuaries and urgently cut emissions. That's why I'm here at the UN talks, pushing for a strong global treaty to protect biodiversity in the high seas. This treaty could pave the way for a network of sanctuaries that rebuild marine populations and boost resilience against ongoing threats.
