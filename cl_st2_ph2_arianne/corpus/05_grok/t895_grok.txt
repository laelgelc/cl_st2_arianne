The Arctic is a vital region, serving as home to threatened wildlife such as polar bears and narwhals, while playing a key role in regulating the global climate. However, it is warming twice as fast as the rest of the planet due to a phenomenon known as Arctic amplification. As sea ice melts, it reduces the Earth's albedo—the reflective quality that bounces sunlight back into space—creating a positive feedback loop that accelerates warming.

This rapid change is altering atmospheric circulations, jet streams, and weather patterns worldwide, resulting in more frequent and intense extreme events like super-storms, droughts, and floods. These disruptions are leading to significant human and economic losses across the globe.

Despite its importance, the Arctic currently lacks adequate international protection. To safeguard this fragile ecosystem, there is an urgent need for ecosystem-based protected areas. Greenpeace is calling on world leaders to establish an Arctic Sanctuary and urges the public to join in supporting this critical initiative. Your voice can help protect the Arctic—add it today.
