Our ship, the Esperanza, is currently touring the Gulf of California to investigate the toxic chemicals stemming from agricultural practices. Greenpeace activists have specifically targeted companies such as Bimbo, La Costeña, and Herdez for their use of harmful fertilizers that are polluting waterways and impacting public health.

In Sinaloa, which produces 38% of Mexico's vegetables and leads the country in grain production, there is heavy reliance on pesticides. Notably, 29 pesticides that are permitted in Mexico have been banned in other countries.

Back in 2012, Mexico applied 120,000 tons of pesticides and 2 million tons of fertilizers across 22 million hectares of land. This extensive use has resulted in soil pollution, residues in food, and damage to coastal ecosystems, including the occurrence of algal blooms.

Together with the Union of Scientists Committed to Society (UCCS), Greenpeace is actively documenting these environmental and health impacts. We are calling on authorities and companies to shift towards sustainable and organic farming methods.
