A recent survey by Greenpeace UK of Scottish offshore oil and gas workers sheds light on the challenges of the energy transition. The findings reveal low morale among these workers, along with low awareness of the concept of a Just Transition—only 9% reported knowing about it. Workers are calling for supported retraining opportunities that lead to secure, well-paid jobs.

To address this, it's crucial to hold polluters accountable through the "polluter pays" principle. Prioritizing a Just Transition on a global scale is essential for ensuring fair climate action.

This situation underscores the importance of solidarity between environmental and labor movements. Examples include support for striking workers and unions that are demanding decent jobs.

At COP26, Greenpeace is calling for ambitious commitments to advance these goals. In the US, Greenpeace supports Biden's jobs plan, the PRO Act, and the creation of unionized green jobs as steps toward building a just society.
