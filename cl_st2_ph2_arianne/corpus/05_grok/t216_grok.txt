In April 2021, the Japanese government made the decision to discharge radioactive water from the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station into the Pacific Ocean. TEPCO, the operator, has planned to dilute this water and release it through an undersea pipeline.

As part of Greenpeace's survey in November 2021, we spoke with local fisherman Mr. Haruo Ono, who expressed profound distress about the plan's effects on Fukushima's fishing industry. He described a decade marked by dishonesty from the government and TEPCO, along with broken promises that have eroded trust.

Mr. Ono pointed out the continued accumulation of contaminated water at the site and the possibility of creating additional storage. He raised concerns about long-term radiation risks, including the accumulation of tritium and carbon-14. He emphasized the threats this poses to livelihoods, future generations, and the ocean's ecosystem, calling on authorities to heed the voices of affected residents.
