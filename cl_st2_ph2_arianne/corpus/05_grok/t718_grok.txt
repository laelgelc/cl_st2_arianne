As the excitement of the World Cup builds in Russia, Greenpeace Russia has taken a closer look at air pollution measures in the host cities. Our survey highlights vehicle emissions as the primary concern, with residents expressing high levels of dissatisfaction in several locations, including 82% in Moscow, 77% in St. Petersburg, and 60% in Kazan.

Some cities are making positive steps forward. In Moscow, restrictions on low-emission vehicles have been implemented, along with EV charging stations and bike paths. St. Petersburg has introduced electric transport and bike infrastructure. Rostov-on-Don has seen a critique of road expansion, while Yekaterinburg offers sustainable options.

However, challenges remain in other areas. Samara and Volgograd lack serious action on air pollution. Sochi has rejected recommendations, and Nizhny Novgorod and Saransk didn't respond to the survey.

Greenpeace plans to hold authorities accountable for improving air quality and urges everyone to join the clean air movement.
