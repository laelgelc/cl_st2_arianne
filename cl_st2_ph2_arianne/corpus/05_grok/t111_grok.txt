The Karipuna People, who were nearly decimated in the 1970s with only eight survivors, now number 61 and inhabit 153,000 hectares of demarcated land in Brazil. This territory has suffered massive invasions by land grabbers and loggers, ranking ninth in deforestation from 2015 to 2021 with 4,700 hectares lost.

Thirteen Karipuna, including elders, traveled to Brasília to deliver a "Cry for Help" letter to ambassadors from eight countries, the EU, and UN representatives. The letter urges the EU to reject products from Amazon deforestation that violate Indigenous rights and presses Brazil to protect their territory amid death threats and resource loss.

Chief André highlighted that exported goods are stained with Indigenous blood, while elders expressed fears of displacement.
