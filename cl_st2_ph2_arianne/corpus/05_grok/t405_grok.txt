In the heart of São Gabriel da Cachoeira, Brazil, Indigenous women leaders Elizângela da Silva (Baré) and Janete Alves (Desana) serve as coordinators of FOIRN's Women's Department. Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, they pivoted from their usual work in handicrafts to producing more than 16,000 protective masks.

Inspired by reports they saw on TV, Elizângela and Janete mobilized a team of artisans. They relied on donated patterns and online tutorials to guide their efforts, ultimately distributing the masks to 23 Indigenous Peoples across the Rio Negro region.

This initiative received funding from the "Rio Negro, Nós Cuidamos" project and support from Greenpeace's Wings of Emergency program, which provided sewing machines.

Throughout this work, the women have confronted profound grief from community losses, including elders who were cremated without traditional rites. Despite these hardships, they continue with resilience, drawing on traditional medicines and a steadfast determination to protect and save lives.
