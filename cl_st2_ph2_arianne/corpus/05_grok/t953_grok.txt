At Greenpeace, we're actively campaigning against the use of chemical pesticides in agriculture. We believe they're unnecessary, especially since ecological pest management has proven successful around the world.

A review of scientific literature highlights the serious health consequences of these chemicals. In industrial farming, routine pesticide application exposes farmers, their families, and the general public to harmful substances. This exposure has been linked to various health problems, including cancers, neurodegenerative diseases, disruptions to the immune system and hormones, birth defects, and developmental issues. These risks are particularly pronounced for pregnant women and children. The literature also points to genetic vulnerabilities that can heighten these effects, as well as potential intergenerational impacts.

Establishing direct causation can be difficult because people often face multiple exposures from different sources.

The way forward is to transition to ecological farming practices, which can provide healthy food while safeguarding people and the environment. We encourage everyone to get involved in the movement for better food systems—join us today.
