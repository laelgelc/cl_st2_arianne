Seabirds, particularly albatrosses, face severe threats from human activities such as industrial overfishing, which depletes the prey fish they rely on and has led to population declines of up to 70% since 1950. Beyond overfishing, these birds encounter additional dangers including bycatch in fishing gear, plastic pollution that kills over a million birds each year, invasive species, historical feather harvesting, collisions, oil spills, toxic chemicals, and ocean acidification driven by CO2 emissions. This acidification has increased ocean acidity by 30% since the Industrial Revolution, harming marine life such as corals and shellfish. Studies underscore the resulting disruptions to ecosystems, with urgent calls for expanded marine reserves, bans on trawling, and restoration efforts to support recovery.
