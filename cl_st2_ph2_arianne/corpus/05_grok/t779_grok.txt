It's time for governments and corporations to urgently break free from fossil fuel addiction. As a sponsor of the Winter Olympics in South Korea, Samsung has the power to lead a transformation in the global tech industry by committing to 100% renewable energy. Samsung's energy footprint is larger than that of a small country, yet less than 1% comes from renewables, with the company relying heavily on coal despite its public relations claims. Backed by thousands of supporters, Greenpeace is calling on Samsung's CEOs to #DoBiggerThings. Through global activism in cities like London and New York, and by encouraging a virtual banner drop via tweets, we're pushing Samsung to make the switch to renewables.
