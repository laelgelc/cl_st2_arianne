Environmental defenders around the world are facing criminalization, threats, surveillance, and violence from governments and corporations. Their movements are being labeled as terrorism and targeted with lawsuits. According to Global Witness, killings of these defenders increased to 207 in 2017, up from 201 in 2016 and 154 in 2015, with 66 more reported in 2018.

One stark example is the murder of Berta Cáceres in 2016. She was killed for her opposition to the Agua Zarca dam in Honduras, a project that threatened local ecosystems and the rights of the Lenca Indigenous people. An investigation has implicated officials from the DESA company in planning the assassination.

The trial of eight individuals accused in her murder begins this week. This proceeding represents an opportunity to end impunity and to demand justice for environmental defenders and the planet.
