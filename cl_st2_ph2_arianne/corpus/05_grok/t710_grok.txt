In 2013, a group known as the 'Arctic 30'—consisting of 28 Greenpeace activists and two journalists—faced two months in jail in Russia. This followed their protest against Gazprom's Arctic oil rig, during which the Dutch-flagged ship Arctic Sunrise was seized in international waters.

After their release on bail and through amnesty, the Arctic 30 filed a case in March 2014 with the European Court of Human Rights. They alleged unlawful detention and violations of their freedom of expression.

While the Netherlands secured a victory in a related case in 2017, the individual rights of the Arctic 30 remain unresolved.

On 12 July 2018, the Arctic 30 submitted their arguments to the court, with support from NGOs ARTICLE 19 and Media Legal Defence Initiative. They requested a hearing, though no decision date has been set.
