As a Greenpeace Denmark activist, I recently took part in an action that I'll never forget. Along with three others, I swam 500 meters from our ship, the Rainbow Warrior, to peacefully occupy the Dan Bravo oil rig in the North Sea. We held our ground there for 36 hours, all in support of our campaign against oil and gas exploration.

To prepare, I trained for a full month, focusing on the physical demands ahead. That included swimming while carrying heavy bags, climbing ladders, and even practicing how to camp on the helipad in strong winds.

Once on the rig, we unfurled a banner and took the time to record messages of thanks to all our supporters who make actions like this possible.

When Total, the operator, decided to shut down production, and with bad weather closing in, we made the swim back to the Rainbow Warrior.

Now, more than ever, I urge everyone to join us in supporting a fossil-free #NorthSeaRevolution.
