Ten years ago, Greenpeace exposed how major brands were sourcing palm oil from companies that were destroying Indonesia's rainforests, putting people, tigers, and orangutans at risk. The resulting public pressure led to the adoption of No Deforestation, No Peat, No Exploitation (NDPE) policies by traders like Wilmar in 2013, with most others following suit by 2014.

However, recent investigations show that these traders still cannot prove their supply chains are free from deforestation and are operating under a 'don’t ask, don’t tell' approach. This failure has contributed to massive forest loss, declining orangutan populations, deadly haze from fires, and human rights abuses.

Brands like PepsiCo and Unilever need to disclose their sources and cut out suppliers linked to destruction. Meanwhile, the discovery of a new Sumatran orangutan species brings some hope, though it too faces threats from habitat loss.
