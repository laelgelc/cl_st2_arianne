In 2020, as the world grappled with the COVID-19 pandemic, 'lockdown' emerged as the Word of the Year, symbolizing the widespread disruptions from isolation measures and health precautions that upended daily lives. Yet, even as societies navigated these challenges, environmental crises escalated, underscoring the urgent need for action on climate and biodiversity fronts.

Greenpeace's 'Protect The Oceans' voyage played a key role, with activists inspecting ships and documenting the impacts of climate change in the Antarctic. In Kenya, farmers turned to ecological practices to build resilience against climate shifts. Devastating wildfires tore through California and Australia, claiming the lives of wildlife and people alike. In the Philippines, powerful typhoons caused widespread flooding, spurring calls for climate justice from affected communities.

A major disaster in Kamchatka resulted in the death of marine life, prompting government responses. Deforestation continued to pose severe threats to vital ecosystems in the Amazon and Gran Chaco regions. The Great Barrier Reef suffered from coral bleaching, highlighting the vulnerability of marine habitats. Globally, floods impacted millions of people, amplifying the human toll of environmental degradation.

We applaud the dedicated activists who have been on the front lines, documenting these threats and pushing for the protections our planet desperately needs.
