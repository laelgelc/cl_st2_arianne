The Spanish Congress has approved the Climate Change and Energy Transition Law, a step forward in addressing environmental challenges, but one that Greenpeace sees as lacking the necessary ambition to truly tackle the climate emergency. While the law incorporates some positive measures, such as promoting public procurement that prioritizes lower emissions, recognizing the role of diet in sustainability, requiring climate finance reporting, and establishing a minimum percentage of the budget dedicated to climate action, it falls significantly short in key areas.

Critically, the legislation does not advance taxation reform, set ambitious emissions targets—aiming for only a 23% reduction by 2030—or commit to phasing out fossil fuels. It also fails to implement bans on advertisements for high-emission products or restrictions on short-haul flights. At Greenpeace, we view this as a watered-down version of what could have been a robust framework for change.

That said, we do acknowledge some strengths in the law, including provisions for low emission zones and energy renovation initiatives. These elements are welcome, but they are not enough. We urge policymakers to strengthen their commitments and pursue a fair ecological transition that meets the urgency of the climate crisis.
