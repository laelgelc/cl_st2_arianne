The COVID-19 crisis has brought to light profound connections between environmental degradation and the emergence of pandemics. One key concept is the "dilution effect," which shows how higher biodiversity can reduce the spread of diseases by diluting the concentration of pathogens in ecosystems.

Activities like deforestation, mining, and urbanization are breaking down natural barriers, bringing humans into closer contact with wildlife and the viruses they carry. Expert Kate Jones has pointed out that these human-driven changes are heightening the risks of disease transmission.

Climate change is further complicating the picture by altering patterns of infectious diseases. Rising temperatures and more frequent extreme weather events are allowing pathogens to spread through vectors such as mosquitoes, expanding their reach into new areas.

Zoonotic diseases, which jump from animals to humans and make up 75% of emerging infectious diseases, are on the rise largely because of habitat loss that forces wildlife into human-dominated spaces.

As we navigate the economic fallout from the pandemic, there are real risks that efforts toward green transitions could be sidelined. This moment calls for radical actions from governments to build a more sustainable world in the post-pandemic era.
