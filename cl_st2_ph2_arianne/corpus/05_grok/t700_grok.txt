Greenpeace supporters have played a key role in convincing Samsung to announce its initial steps in June to shift production lines from fossil fuels to renewables. This development offers hope amid global extreme weather events.

The move aligns with South Korea's transition away from nuclear and fossil fuels. Greenpeace East Asia has outlined specific actions for Samsung to power its factories in China, the US, and Europe with renewables, while urging the company to expand these efforts to South Korea and Vietnam. A report detailing these recommendations was sent to Samsung's company leaders.

In another positive step, Facebook has committed to achieving 100% renewable energy globally by 2020.

At Greenpeace, we aim to push more companies toward adopting renewables.
