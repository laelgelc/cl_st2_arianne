In the mountainous village of Daraitan in Rizal province, the Dumagat Remontado indigenous people carefully harvest taro and purple yam from their hilltop farms. These practices, handed down through generations, provide essential sustenance for their community.

Amid the challenges of the pandemic and their ongoing opposition to the proposed Kaliwa Dam—which poses a risk of submerging their sacred lands and vital farmlands—the Dumagat Remontado have shown remarkable resilience. When Typhoon Vamco brought severe flooding, they relied on ancestral visions to guide their timely evacuation, helping them endure the disaster.

In a powerful act of generosity, the community responded to appeals for help by donating their harvested vegetables to community pantries in Metro Manila. These pantries, part of a grassroots movement to share food during lockdowns, have helped build bonds of solidarity and bayanihan spirit between the indigenous farmers and city dwellers.
