Cities play a crucial role in addressing the climate crisis. Mayors and citizens must prioritize planetary and human health through resilient actions such as improved public transport, bike lanes, local food access, and green spaces. Urban areas face vulnerabilities including pollution, inequality, and heatwaves, which are exacerbated by climate change. Projections indicate rising temperatures and longer heatwaves in European cities. Currently, 55% of the global population lives in cities, a figure expected to rise to 68% by 2050, and cities produce 70% of emissions. Green policies can save up to $17 trillion by 2050. On World Cities Day, immediate government action is demanded to build sustainable, resilient urban futures.
