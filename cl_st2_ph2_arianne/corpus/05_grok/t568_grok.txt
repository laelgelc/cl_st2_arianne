Greenpeace is setting off on an exciting expedition aboard our ship, the Esperanza, heading to the Sargasso Sea. This unique ecosystem lies in the Bermuda Triangle, known for its clear waters and endemic life. But today, it's under serious threat from plastic pollution that's getting trapped in ocean gyres.

These plastics are causing real harm to wildlife, including turtles, whales, and fish, and they're even making their way into the food chain. To help this vital area recover, we're calling for the creation of ocean sanctuaries through a new Global Ocean Treaty. These sanctuaries would shield the ocean from additional stresses like overfishing, vessel traffic, and deep-sea mining—much like how rest is essential when you're fighting off an illness.

We need your help to make this happen. Please sign our petition and join us in pressuring corporations to stop producing single-use plastics. Together, we can protect the Sargasso Sea and our oceans for the future.
