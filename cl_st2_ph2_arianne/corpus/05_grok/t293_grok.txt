Greenpeace's Arctic Sunrise recently completed a four-month voyage in the Indian Ocean, where our team investigated destructive fishing practices and researched vital ecosystems. Along the way, we highlighted powerful stories from Mauritius, Seychelles, and Madagascar.

These regions face serious threats from industrial fishing, pollution, and climate breakdown, which are harming wildlife, ecosystems, and the livelihoods of local communities.

To amplify these issues, we're introducing the Vital Ocean Voices project. This initiative provides grants and support to local individuals and NGOs, enabling them to share their firsthand accounts through writing, videos, animations, and poems.

Among the stories featured are Kylian's response to an oil spill, Madame Kokoly's experiences as a fisher, Aurelie's deep connection to the ocean, efforts to rehabilitate mangroves in Seychelles, and environmental actions taken by school pupils.
