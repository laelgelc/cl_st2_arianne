We at Greenpeace are deeply saddened by the recent passing of Wallace Smith Broecker, the pioneering climate scientist who first predicted global warming back in 1975. His death marks a poignant symbol of the generational shift underway in the fight against climate change. As we lose these foundational voices, a new wave of youth-led school strikes, inspired by the courage of Greta Thunberg, is rising up to demand urgent action. These young activists are responding to the increasingly visible impacts of the climate crisis, from devastating extreme weather events that are already reshaping our world.

Broecker's legacy reminds us of the stark warnings we've long ignored. The IPCC has made it clear: we have just 12 years to prevent climate chaos, which means we must halve CO2 emissions by 2030 and achieve net zero by 2050. These targets are not optional—they're essential for survival.

Yet, even with the Paris Agreement in place and the rules set at COP24, political inaction continues to stall progress. Temperatures are rising, and we're seeing record heat waves that underscore the emergency. It's time for all of us to stand in solidarity with the striking youth, amplifying their calls for change. Leaders must step up with bolder commitments to turn the tide before it's too late.
