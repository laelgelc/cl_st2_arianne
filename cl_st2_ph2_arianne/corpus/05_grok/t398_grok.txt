Footage has emerged showing the sea burial of Ari, a 24-year-old Indonesian migrant fisher who died from poor treatment on a Chinese-owned vessel operated by Dalian Ocean Fishing, along with three others. This story was broken by the South Korean broadcaster MBC and has since gone viral online, leading to reports of additional deaths and pleas for rescue from other fishers.

Mobile technology is now allowing fishers to document instances of mistreatment, forced labor, human trafficking, and illegal practices such as shark finning—issues that Greenpeace has long uncovered in the fishing industry.

While the Indonesian government has largely ignored modern slavery in this sector, it has recently taken some reactionary steps in response to these events. To address the problem effectively, the government must hold recruitment agencies, companies, and fishing fleets accountable through improved monitoring and oversight.
