It is with deep sadness that we share the news of the passing of Greenpeace cofounder Dorothy Metcalfe on December 10. As a seasoned journalist, Dorothy played a pivotal role in the organization's early days, managing radio communications and media outreach during the 1971-1972 campaigns against U.S. and French nuclear tests at Amchitka and Moruroa. Her efforts included pressuring leaders like Pierre Trudeau and arranging an audience with Pope Paul VI. Together with her husband Ben, she turned a French deportation into a publicity coup that amplified their message.

Born in 1931 in Winnipeg, Dorothy became a dedicated peace activist who helped launch Greenpeace through innovative tactics such as billboards and boat protests.

A Celebration of Life for Dorothy is scheduled for February 18 in West Vancouver.
