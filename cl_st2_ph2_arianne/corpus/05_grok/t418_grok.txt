Migrant fishers from Southeast Asia often board industrial fishing vessels with hopes of securing better lives for themselves and their families. However, these aspirations frequently give way to brutal realities resembling modern slavery, marked by grueling long hours, physical and verbal abuse, and in some tragic cases, even death at sea.

As consumers, we have the power to make a difference by opting for sustainable seafood choices and spreading awareness about these injustices to pressure the industry for change.

Greenpeace has brought these hidden stories to light through two powerful films, shot in Taiwan and featuring real Indonesian workers. These films are rooted in true accounts uncovered by Greenpeace East Asia and Southeast Asia. They portray the grim experiences of fishers, including the unfair treatment they endure and their deep personal motivations, such as providing for their families. More than 30 fishers were interviewed for this work, many expressing fear of losing their jobs if they speak out against the conditions.
