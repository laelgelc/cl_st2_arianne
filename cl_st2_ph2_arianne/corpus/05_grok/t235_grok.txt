The European Union has proposed a new law aimed at curbing its contribution to global deforestation and human rights abuses, marking a historic step forward. However, this legislation falls short in several critical areas.

Under the proposal, companies would be required to trace high-risk commodities back to their origins and ensure they meet sustainability standards. Yet, the law's protections are limited to forests alone, leaving out vital ecosystems such as savannas and wetlands that are equally at risk. It also fails to cover key products driving deforestation, including rubber, maize, pork, and poultry.

Moreover, the rights of Indigenous peoples, who are often on the frontlines of these issues, are not safeguarded in the proposal. The role of the finance sector, which continues to fund destructive activities, is entirely overlooked.

Even as corporations push back against these measures, we must seize this opportunity to demand better. Building on commitments made at COP26 and the momentum from a petition signed by 1.1 million people calling for clean supply chains, it's time to pressure EU governments and the European Parliament to strengthen this law and make it truly effective.
