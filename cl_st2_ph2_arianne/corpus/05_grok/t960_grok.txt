The Antarctic is facing rapid environmental changes, underscoring the urgent need for increased funding in scientific research and conservation efforts. However, it's crucial to scrutinize the sources of such funding carefully.

Aker Biomarine, a major krill fishing company, has announced a new research fund, which raises concerns about potential greenwashing. Krill serves as a keystone species in the Southern Ocean ecosystem, playing an essential role in supporting whales, penguins, seals, and other wildlife.

There are significant concerns regarding the harvesting of krill for use in supplements and animal feed. This practice is unsustainable, particularly in the context of climate change and ocean acidification.

Greenpeace has published a paper opposing the certification of Aker's fishery.
