In Brazil, a major scandal has exposed deep flaws in the meat industry. Police investigations revealed that big companies like JBS and BRF were bribing inspectors to certify meat that wasn't safe for consumption. Practices included using chemicals to hide the smell and appearance of rotten meat, mixing pigs' heads into sausages, and even adding cardboard to chicken products.

The fallout was swift: countries including China and the European Union, along with others, imposed bans on Brazilian meat imports to protect public health.

This isn't just a one-off issue—it's a symptom of broader problems in global industrial meat production. The system is tied to outbreaks of diseases and significant environmental damage, such as widespread deforestation. Industrial meat production contributes around 14% of global greenhouse gas emissions.

At Greenpeace, we're calling for change. Shifting to plant-rich diets and eating less meat overall can make a real difference. We also need to hold governments accountable for regulating the industry better. Our campaign pushes for meat that's sourced locally and sustainably, ensuring it's produced in ways that respect the planet.

In a recent update to this story, it's come to light that these companies have been purchasing cattle raised on lands that were illegally deforested, further fueling environmental destruction.
