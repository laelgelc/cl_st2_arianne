In the vast landscapes of Russia, peat fires pose a relentless threat, but Greenpeace Russia is stepping up to support firefighters and volunteers in the fight. Drawing on scientific research and decades of hands-on experience, we're equipping those on the front lines with the tools they need to combat these destructive blazes.

Take volunteer Alexi as an example. He started out simply cleaning up garbage in local parks, but over time, his commitment grew, leading him to specialize in fire suppression techniques. Stories like his highlight the dedication of individuals who are making a real difference in protecting our environment.

To further aid these efforts, we've developed a comprehensive guide on extinguishing peat fires, which is now available in English. This resource delves into effective flooding methods, the principles of hydrology, and cutting-edge technologies such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and satellite data for better monitoring and response.

It's crucial to remember that most wildfires originate from human activities, which is why prevention must take precedence over just reacting after the fact. Peat fires, intensified by climate change, unleash enormous amounts of carbon emissions and toxic smoke. They also give rise to so-called zombie fires that smolder underground and reignite, endangering biodiversity and fueling further global warming. By addressing these fires head-on, we're working to safeguard ecosystems and curb the cycle of climate acceleration.
