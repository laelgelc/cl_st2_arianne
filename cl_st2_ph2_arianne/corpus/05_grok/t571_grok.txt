June marked the hottest month on record, and July is on track to surpass it. Across Europe, temperatures soared to 45.6°C in France, while in India, heat exceeded 50°C, leading to deaths and raising concerns about potential future uninhabitability in affected areas.

European leaders are delaying the transition away from fossil fuels, citing economic concerns. However, achieving net zero emissions could generate jobs, deliver health benefits, and result in trillions in savings.

Around the world, protests are demanding urgent action. Examples include the successful efforts to save Hambach Forest and the Fridays for Future movement.

Greenpeace's Unite for Climate tour is traveling across Europe to expose the barriers to change, connect those opposing inaction, and highlight the real impacts of the climate crisis.

Looking ahead, by 2050, 75% of cities could face dramatically shifted climates. Heat exposure is increasing, and coal remains a major contributor, accounting for 46% of global CO2 emissions.
