In our society, mobility is often seen as a symbol of individual freedom and status, fueled by cars, oil, and aggressive marketing. This perspective overlooks the serious long-term consequences, including widespread pollution, streets that are unsafe for children, and significant damage to the climate.

This view also underscores a deep inequality: wealthier individuals contribute disproportionately to emissions through their choices, yet the burdens of air pollution, traffic accidents, and environmental degradation affect everyone equally.

As we emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic, it's time for a fundamental shift toward resilient mobility systems. This means promoting safe walking and cycling, ensuring accessible public transport, using electric cars only for essential needs rather than oversized SUVs, prioritizing affordable trains instead of flights, and incorporating more green spaces.

Ultimately, mobility must be reimagined to serve society as a whole, fostering true autonomy and social cohesion while treating it as a sustainable common good.
