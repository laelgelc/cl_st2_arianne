In the face of the escalating climate crisis, transforming how we use land is not just an option—it's essential for our survival. Industrial agriculture is wreaking havoc by destroying vast forests and eroding biodiversity, driving countless species perilously close to extinction. To turn this around, we must halt the relentless expansion of such practices, commit to restoring natural areas, and embrace ecological farming methods that minimize chemical use and safeguard vital insect populations.

At the heart of this effort is the need to respect the rights of Indigenous Peoples, whose lands play a crucial role in preserving biodiversity. Meanwhile, intensive farming is degrading our soils, which serve as critical stores of carbon. By shifting toward plant-based diets and reducing meat consumption, we can boost efficiency, feed more people, improve public health, and significantly cut emissions from both agriculture and deforestation.

Ultimately, protecting forests and grasslands is key to enhancing carbon sequestration and keeping global warming limited to 1.5°C. These steps toward better land use offer a path forward in combating the climate crisis.
