Fast fashion giants like H&M and Zara have driven a dramatic surge in global clothing production, doubling it to 100 billion garments each year. This boom results in clothes being worn for shorter periods, contributing to enormous amounts of waste piling up in landfills, and fueling overconsumption that's propelled by affordable prices and emotional impulses.

Extending the lifespan of our clothes from just one year to two can make a significant difference, reducing carbon emissions by 24% while conserving vital resources such as water and fossil fuels.

It's time to rethink our connection with clothing, break free from the cycle of addiction, and rediscover what true fashion means. Join the Fashion Revolution by participating in activities like sewing, upcycling, repairs, swaps, and secondhand shopping. Explore options through Haulternatives, take on challenges, use maps to find resources, and share your own love stories about cherished garments.
