As the Reykjavik Summit approaches on May 16-17, 2023, Council of Europe states have a crucial opportunity to recognize the human right to a clean, healthy, and sustainable environment. This recognition would address a significant gap in the European human rights framework, especially in the face of the triple planetary crisis encompassing pollution, climate change, and biodiversity loss.

The threats are stark: air pollution claims the lives of 1,200 children each year in Europe, while war-related environmental harms add to the devastation.

The United Nations has already affirmed this right, setting a global precedent. By adopting a dedicated protocol to the European Convention on Human Rights, states could enhance protection for people and the planet, bolster climate action, provide legal certainty, and offer safeguards for environmental defenders.

We urge you to take action now. Tweet your representatives to push for this recognition, and sign up for campaign updates to stay involved in the fight for a healthier future.
