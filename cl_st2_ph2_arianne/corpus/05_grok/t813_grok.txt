The Congo Basin forest is a vibrant expanse, teeming with endangered wildlife. It serves as a vital lifeline for local Indigenous communities, providing them with water, food, medicine, and spiritual sustenance.

This remarkable region is also home to the world's largest peatland complex, recently discovered and essential for storing carbon and mitigating climate change. However, these peatlands face serious threats from logging and agribusiness activities, such as palm oil plantations. These pressures are causing biodiversity loss and reducing the forest's overall resilience.

At Greenpeace, we're calling on everyone to get involved in protecting this invaluable ecosystem. Join us by dancing to the song "Dance for the Congo Basin" and sharing your moves with the hashtag #DanceForCongo. You can also add your wishes to our traveling "Wish Tree," which will make its way to COP23. And for those ready for adventure, come aboard our ship Esperanza in 2017 for an expedition to explore these peatlands firsthand.
