As leaders of Greenpeace International and Amnesty International, we are writing this open letter to draw attention to the profound ways in which climate change is undermining fundamental human rights. The crisis is eroding people's rights to health, food, water, housing, work, and even life itself, with the most vulnerable populations bearing the brunt of these impacts.

We call for urgent action and justice in response. Governments must be held accountable, and corporations must take responsibility for their role in this emergency. Solutions already exist, including the rapid adoption of renewables and a commitment to respecting human rights.

Around the world, diverse groups are mobilizing to demand change: students, Indigenous Peoples, workers, and activists are all stepping up in this fight.

To further this momentum, we are proud to announce the People’s Summit on Climate, Rights and Human Survival, taking place on September 18-19 in New York. Organized by civil society and the UN Human Rights Office, this summit aims to bring together the human rights and environmental communities to advance climate justice.
