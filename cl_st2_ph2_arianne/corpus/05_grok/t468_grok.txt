As the coronavirus crisis unfolds, it's a pivotal moment to rethink how we allocate public funds. Instead of supporting industries that harm the planet, we should redirect those resources toward bolstering public health, ensuring planetary well-being, and enabling a just transition to a more harmonious future by 2030.

We must be wary of the "shock doctrine" that could exploit workers during this time. Leaders need to be held accountable, and our responses should prioritize community, cooperation, and compassion rather than fostering blame or division.

The choices we make now should focus on protecting the vulnerable, drawing deep lessons from the crisis, and building toward an open, egalitarian, and peaceful world.

Even as we face personal challenges, there are inspiring acts of courage emerging. Vigilance is essential, because crises like this one have the power to make the impossible possible.
