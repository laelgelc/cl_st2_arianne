Pukaldi, an Indonesian fisher, spent 30 months at sea without setting foot on land, trapped by transshipment practices in distant water fishing. He faced grueling long hours, poor working conditions, and unpaid wages during this ordeal. His experience underscores the systemic exploitation of migrant workers in the industry, which is often connected to illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing.

This story is a stark reminder of the human cost behind seafood production. Greenpeace Indonesia's Beyond Seafood campaign is actively fighting against slavery at sea, aiming to enhance ocean governance and protect those who work on the waves.

In a significant step, Pukaldi, alongside the Indonesian Migrant Workers Union (SBMI), took legal action against the government for delays in issuing a regulation tied to a 2017 worker protection law. The regulation was finally signed in June 2022, prompting the revocation of the lawsuit. However, the work doesn't stop there—ongoing efforts are focused on ensuring the regulation's proper implementation and resolving issues like unpaid wages for affected workers.
