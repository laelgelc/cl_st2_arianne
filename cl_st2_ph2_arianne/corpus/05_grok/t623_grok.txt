On March 15th, 1.5 million school students took to the streets in protests across 123 countries. These young people were motivated by their fear for their future, their love for the planet, and their anger at leaders' inaction on climate change. In their actions, they directly challenged policy-makers and business leaders, posing the question: are you as smart as we are?

This global event produced some of the most moving images we've seen. From crowds of determined students marching with handmade signs in city centers around the world to gatherings in diverse locations spanning continents, these visuals capture the passion and urgency of the moment.
