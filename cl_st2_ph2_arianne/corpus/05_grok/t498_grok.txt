Greenpeace UK has teamed up with Aardman Animations and acclaimed actors including Olivia Colman and Helen Mirren to release the short film "Turtle Journey." This powerful animation follows a family of turtles as they navigate an ocean ravaged by human impacts such as overfishing, oil drilling, plastic pollution, and climate breakdown.

The film underscores the vital role oceans play in absorbing emissions to help fight the climate crisis. It calls for the protection of at least a third of the world's oceans through sanctuaries negotiated by the UN under a Global Ocean Treaty.

We urge everyone to sign our petition and share the video to push governments to act on ocean protection. Sea turtles face severe threats, and marine species are disappearing at a faster rate than animals on land.
