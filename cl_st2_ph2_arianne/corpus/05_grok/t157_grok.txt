Oil companies like Chevron and Shell are promoting carbon capture and storage (CCS), also known as CCUS, as a way to address climate change, but it's really a scam that allows them to pocket public subsidies while pretending to take action on the climate crisis. In reality, these schemes help them boost oil production under the guise of environmental progress.

Take Australia's Gorgon project, for example. Despite receiving $60 million in public handouts, it has only captured 2% of its total emissions targets. That's a glaring failure that shows how ineffective and wasteful these initiatives are.

Similarly, Shell's Quest plant in Canada is emitting more greenhouse gases than it captures, making the problem worse instead of better.

The truth is, CCS requires extra energy to operate, which ends up increasing overall emissions. After decades of development, CCS globally captures just 0.1% of annual CO2 emissions, and much of that is used for enhanced oil recovery, which further supports fossil fuel extraction.

Scientists have called CCS a pipe dream that's essentially subsidizing the fossil fuel industry with public money.
