As we navigate the challenges of self-isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic, it's crucial to prioritize our physical and mental health while staying true to our guiding values. We're deeply grateful to the essential workers—nurses, doctors, delivery drivers, and so many others—who are showing incredible bravery on the front lines every day.

To make the most of this time at home, we've curated a list of environmental films and series that inspire and educate. Dive into Leonardo DiCaprio's personal journey as he witnesses the devastating effects of climate change firsthand. Explore the origins of our movement with a look at the founding of Greenpeace. Celebrate the groundbreaking oceanographic work of Sylvia Earle and her efforts to protect marine life. Reflect on sustainable living through a documentary on minimalism. Hear the powerful stories of Brazilians directly affected by climate crises. Challenge assumptions with a film that debunks myths around meat consumption, featuring Arnold Schwarzenegger. Uncover the dark side of energy production in "Sexy Killer," which exposes scandals in Indonesia's coal industry. And witness the urgent threat of coral bleaching in a documentary focused on Australia's reefs.
