The collapse of a Vale-operated tailings dam in Brumadinho, Brazil, unleashed 13 million cubic meters of toxic mining waste, resulting in the deaths of 110 people and leaving over 230 missing. This disaster has severely affected the Pataxó Hã-hã-hãe Indigenous community's Naô Xohã village, where contamination of the Paraopeba River has made fishing and bathing impossible. Community leaders Hayô and Werymerry have voiced their despair, drawing parallels to the 2015 Mariana disaster, and they strongly oppose mining activities on Indigenous lands. The community, which includes vulnerable members, is now dependent on donations for survival. Greenpeace is on the ground documenting this tragedy and calling for justice.
