In a powerful demonstration of sustainable recovery, Greenpeace Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) has teamed up with Ukrainian organizations Ecoaction, Ecoclub, and Victory of Ukraine to rebuild a hospital in Horenka, near Kyiv, that was damaged by war. The reconstruction features the installation of a heat pump equipped with 65-meter ground probes, alongside a hybrid solar power system.

This initiative boosts the hospital's energy independence while significantly reducing CO2 emissions. It also slashes heating costs by 80% and meets up to 60% of the facility's energy requirements. The total investment of €56,000 is expected to be recovered in just 6-7 years.

The project embodies the "Build Back Better" approach, steering clear of outdated systems to create a more resilient and eco-friendly infrastructure. Looking ahead, Greenpeace aims to collaborate with European cities to support similar sustainable reconstruction efforts as Ukraine continues its recovery.
