In our fight against planetary erosion, recognizing the interconnectedness of all things emerges as a vital strategy. Feminist leaders from the global South are at the forefront, pushing for a profound economic transformation that places care work, social reproduction, and resilience for all life at its core.

Indigenous perspectives emphasize protecting nature as our shared home, reminding us that interconnected problems require interconnected solutions grounded in care and respect.
