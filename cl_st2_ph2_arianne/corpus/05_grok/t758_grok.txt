Indigenous leaders and supporters are standing strong against Kinder Morgan's tar sands pipeline in Canada. They're resisting by building a "Watch House" near the pipeline route and organizing protests, where over 10,000 people have marched and 170 have been arrested.

The pipeline lacks Indigenous consent and would transport polluting bitumen. It would also increase supertanker traffic, threatening endangered orcas, and pose risks of spills that could contaminate water.

Protesters are drawing parallels to Standing Rock, where violence occurred and ETP filed a $900 million SLAPP suit against Greenpeace and others to suppress dissent. Despite this, the suit has strengthened the movement.

Greenpeace reaffirms its commitment to protecting the coast.
