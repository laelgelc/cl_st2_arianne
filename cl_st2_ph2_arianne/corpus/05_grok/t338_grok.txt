In Europe, meat consumption is on the decline, and this shift has the meat and dairy industries turning to aggressive advertising in an attempt to turn the tide. What's particularly alarming is the revelation that the EU has allocated €252.4 million in public funds over the past five years to promote these products. That's more money than what's been spent on promoting fruits and vegetables. Campaigns such as “Love pork!” and “Become a beefatarian!” are part of this push, yet they completely overlook critical issues related to health, ecology, and animal welfare.

Scientists are clear in their recommendations: we need to reduce our intake of meat and dairy to safeguard our health and protect the planet from threats like pandemics, climate damage, and the destruction of nature.

It's time to rethink how these public funds are used. Instead, they should be redirected to promote fruits and vegetables, while also supporting small-scale, ecological farmers who can help build a more sustainable food system.
