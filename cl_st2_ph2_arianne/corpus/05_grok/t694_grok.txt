I remember a dive in Thailand that I'll never forget. I was teaching a young couple to dive, surrounded by stunning reefs and corals. But then, sudden influxes of plastic trash ruined the scene, affecting marine life like fish and turtles.

This experience highlights the ocean pollution crisis. Up to 12 million tonnes of plastic enter the oceans annually, harming ecosystems and humans.

As an ocean advocate and the founder of Divein.com, I urge individuals to avoid single-use plastics, pick up litter, and pressure companies by photographing branded waste on social media with #IsThisYours. I also suggest convincing local businesses to reduce plastics and writing newspaper letters to protect oceans for future generations.
