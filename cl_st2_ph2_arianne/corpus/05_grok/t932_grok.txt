The World Health Organization (WHO) classifies processed meat as carcinogenic and red meat as probably carcinogenic, which raises significant concerns about current levels of meat consumption. Producing the meat and dairy for just one person's annual needs requires 403,000 liters of water, an amount equivalent to taking 6,190 showers. In 2011, 8,481 tons of antibiotics were sold for use in EU livestock. Animal agriculture involves breeding 1 billion pigs, 19 billion chickens, and 1.4 billion cattle, and it is responsible for 80% of deforestation in the Amazon as well as emitting more greenhouse gases than the entire transport sector. This industry also uses 80% of global soy production for animal feed. To address these issues, consider reducing your weekly meat intake by half and incorporating more local fruits and vegetables, which can offer benefits for health, ethics, and the environment.
