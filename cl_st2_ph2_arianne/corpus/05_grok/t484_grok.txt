In 2016, I visited Ecuador's Amazon and saw firsthand how Indigenous and farmer communities have been poisoned by Chevron's oil waste. This contamination has led to cancer, birth defects, and pollution levels that exceed legal standards.

These communities pursued justice and won a $9.5 billion judgment against Chevron in Ecuadorian courts. The judgment was upheld on appeals, but Chevron has refused to pay.

Instead, Chevron launched retaliatory attacks on Steven Donziger, the lawyer who represented the communities. This included a US RICO case overseen by Judge Kaplan.

In that case, Judge Kaplan accepted false testimony from a paid witness, barred evidence of the pollution, and later imposed home detention on Donziger for contempt.

This situation underscores the lengths to which corporations will go to intimidate environmental advocates fighting for accountability.
