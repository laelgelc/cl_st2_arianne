Major brands including McDonald’s, Tesco, Young’s Seafood, and Iglo, along with the Norwegian Fishing Vessel Owners Association, Russian Karat Group, and Espersen, have agreed to oppose the expansion of cod fishing into the previously frozen Northern Barents Sea. They are imposing a moratorium on bottom trawling in this sensitive Arctic area, which is twice the size of France. This step protects vulnerable species such as polar bears, bowhead whales, and Greenland sharks. At Greenpeace, we credit global public action for this achievement. We will monitor compliance using our ship, the Arctic Sunrise, and we are urging Norway’s government to establish a Marine Protected Area that is off-limits to extractive industries.
