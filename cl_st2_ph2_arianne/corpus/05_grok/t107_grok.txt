European countries and cities are introducing affordable 'climate tickets' for public transport to combat rising fuel prices, save energy, and reduce emissions. These schemes are proving popular and beneficial for households. Funding concerns can be addressed by redirecting fossil fuel subsidies or imposing windfall taxes. A Greenpeace report on 30 European ticketing systems reveals inconsistencies in affordability and simplicity, especially for discounts targeting vulnerable groups like the disabled, low-income, elderly, and refugees. No ideal cross-border, inclusive climate ticket exists yet, though successes in Germany, Spain, Austria, and others show reduced car use and emissions. Calls urge EU-wide implementation for equitable, sustainable mobility.
