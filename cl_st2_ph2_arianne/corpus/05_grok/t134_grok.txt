Growing up in a diverse and religiously vibrant township in South Africa, I experienced a world rich in cultural traditions but often limited by insularity. Our community grappled with embracing the constitutional diversity that defines our nation, creating tensions that shaped my early years.

Today, these challenges are starkly visible in the rising hate crimes against the LGBTQIA+ community, which have escalated to the point of prompting direct action from the president.

This social unrest unfolds against the backdrop of severe climate change impacts. Water scarcity drives migration, reduces productivity, and exacerbates food insecurity and hunger, affecting 40% of South Africans.

In this context, religion is often wielded as a tool for manipulation. It shifts blame away from corporate greed and onto marginalized groups, framing climate-induced events like droughts, floods, and locust invasions as signs of the "end times." These phenomena are confirmed by IPCC reports as direct consequences of climate change.

We need grassroots sensitization efforts to address these issues and build equitable futures that prioritize people over profit.
