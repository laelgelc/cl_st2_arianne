Greenpeace’s Antarctic Ambassadors, a group that includes artists, actors, scientists, explorers, and others, are calling for urgent protection of the Antarctic. They emphasize the shared responsibility we all have to safeguard Earth’s fragile places. These ambassadors have ventured into the depths of the Antarctic Ocean, interacted with penguins, engaged with world leaders, and worked to raise awareness about the region's pressing need for help. At the heart of their efforts is advocacy for an Antarctic Ocean Sanctuary, which would be the world’s largest protected area. This sanctuary would offer a safe haven for penguins, whales, and seals in the face of climate change, pollution, and overfishing. Healthy oceans play a vital role in supporting carbon cycling to mitigate climate impacts and ensuring food security for billions of people. What happens in the Antarctic affects everyone around the globe.
