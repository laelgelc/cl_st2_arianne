As we celebrate Women’s History Month, it’s a fitting time to honor the women who played pivotal roles in founding Greenpeace nearly 50 years ago. Their contributions were essential to our inaugural voyage protesting U.S. nuclear tests near Amchitka Island, laying the groundwork for the environmental movement we know today.

Dorothy Stowe co-founded Greenpeace and offered stabilizing leadership that helped guide the organization through its early challenges.

Marie Bohlen proposed the idea of sailing to the test site to protest and co-founded the Don’t Make A Wave Committee, which was a precursor to Greenpeace.

Dorothy Metcalfe relayed media reports to keep the public informed, encouraged the crew to persist during the voyage, and lobbied Canadian MPs to build support for the cause.

Zoe Hunter introduced Bob Hunter to pacifism, shaping the non-violent ethos of our actions, and helped provision the ships for the journey.

While the crew on that first voyage was all-male, this was a mistake that overlooked the essential contributions of these women and others who made the protest possible.
