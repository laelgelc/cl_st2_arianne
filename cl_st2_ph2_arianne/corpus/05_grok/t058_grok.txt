Greenpeace activists from countries severely impacted by climate change took bold action by occupying a Shell ship that was transporting equipment for the Penguins oil and gas field in the North Sea. This occupation became the organization's longest protest ever conducted on a moving platform, spanning 13 days from January 31 to February 12.

The protest shone a spotlight on Shell's staggering $39.9 billion in record profits, even as the world grapples with devastating climate impacts, such as the floods in Pakistan. Our activists demanded that Shell immediately halt its drilling activities and take responsibility by paying for the destruction they've contributed to. They emphasized that the Penguins project alone would release 45 million tonnes of CO2 into the atmosphere.

Despite facing a court order and a $120,000 claim for damages from Shell, additional activists joined the occupation. The action concluded with the protesters displaying a banner as the ship reached Norway.
