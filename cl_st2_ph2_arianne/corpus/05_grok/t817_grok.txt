Today marks a major victory for nature as the EU-wide ban on the pesticide fipronil in agriculture takes effect, offering vital protection to bees, bumblebees, butterflies, and other insects.

This ban addresses the dangers of fipronil, which was at the center of a 2017 egg contamination scandal that impacted 49 countries and revealed deep flaws in our food system. The pesticide's toxicity to pollinators, particularly through its use in seed treatments, has long been a concern.

Greenpeace has been campaigning for restrictions on fipronil since 2013, leading to those initial limits and now this full prohibition across the EU.

However, threats to pollinators persist from other pesticides like neonicotinoids, and we urge further bans grounded in scientific evidence.

To truly protect our environment, we must transition from industrial farming to ecological farming practices that address climate change, biodiversity loss, and pollution. The upcoming reform of the EU's Common Agricultural Policy presents a key opportunity to drive this change.
