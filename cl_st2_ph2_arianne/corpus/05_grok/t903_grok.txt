In the vast expanse of the Indian Ocean, our Greenpeace activists aboard the Esperanza took bold action against destructive fishing practices by confronting the Explorer II, a vessel linked to Thai Union's supply chain. Using eco-friendly paint, they blacked out the ship's 80 high-powered lights, which are used to lure marine life. When the Explorer II fled the Coco de Mer seamount, our team pursued it relentlessly.

This ship anchors in key areas and deploys these intense lights to attract schools of fish and other marine life, allowing fishing vessels to net them indiscriminately. Owned by the Albacora Group, the Explorer II supplies tuna to well-known brands like John West.

For weeks, our activists have been actively removing similar destructive gear from the ocean, working to protect vulnerable marine ecosystems. This confrontation comes on the heels of a recent summit that banned the use of such lights, drawing attention to how overfishing devastates our oceans and the communities that depend on them. It's a call to action for everyone to join the movement for real change and safeguard our seas.
