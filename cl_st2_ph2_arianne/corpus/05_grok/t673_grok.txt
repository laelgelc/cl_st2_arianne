After eight years of public pressure, European tuna giant Bolton has adopted a progressive sourcing policy. The company has moved from being a laggard in 2011 to committing that 50% of its tuna—up 22%—comes from selective methods like pole and line or FAD-free purse seining. Bolton will cap FADs at 300, prohibit supply vessels, and reduce bycatch.

This development follows Thai Union's landmark commitments last year amid Greenpeace campaigns addressing overfishing, bycatch, and labor abuses. The changes signal industry momentum for ocean and worker protection, urging other companies to improve, while highlighting individual actions' impact.

Greenpeace calls for an Antarctic ocean sanctuary.
