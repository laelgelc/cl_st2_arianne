In our increasingly interconnected world, the global food system is fundamentally broken. It undermines human health, devastates the environment, and deepens inequality, all while vast amounts of food go to waste even as hunger affects millions.

Amid these challenges, inspiring stories of community action offer hope. In Chiang Mai, Thailand, Supawut Boonmahathanakorn and his team stepped up during the Covid-19 pandemic to address food insecurity among the urban poor. They converted a 4,800-square-meter vacant dumping ground into a thriving urban farm, with backing from the local community and municipal authorities.

Today, the farm produces organic crops such as morning glories and corn. Harvests are shared directly with those in need, while excess produce is sold to ensure the project's long-term sustainability. The initiative also supports local soup kitchens and provides spaces for education, showcasing how grassroots efforts can build food sovereignty and empower people to reclaim control over their food systems.
