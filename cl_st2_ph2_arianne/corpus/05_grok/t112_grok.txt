Africa's environmental movement stands at a critical crossroads, and it cannot truly succeed without a fundamental process of decolonization. The legacy of colonial-era extraction of raw materials continues to this day, allowing foreign elites to reap benefits while inflicting severe damage on ecosystems, economies, and local communities across the continent.

To break this cycle, African leaders must reject imposed Western models and instead embrace traditional values that emphasize collaboration and respect for nature. This shift involves building inward-focused economies that prioritize collective well-being, foster local innovation, and support informal activities.

Consider the ongoing impacts: Shell's pollution in Nigeria has devastated environments and livelihoods. In the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), rampant deforestation persists even as poverty deepens. Multinational projects, such as oil drilling in Namibia, pipelines in East Africa, and auctions in the DRC, continue to push forward, exacerbating the climate crises. These activities worsen the effects of floods, droughts, and rising food prices that are already plaguing the region.
