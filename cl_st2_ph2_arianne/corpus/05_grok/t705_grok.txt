Sarah-Jeanne Royer, a French-Canadian postdoctoral scholar at the University of Hawaii's School of Ocean and Earth Science & Technology, has uncovered a concerning reality: decomposing plastic is generating a new source of greenhouse gas emissions that hasn't been factored into previous climate models. As plastic production and accumulation continue to grow, these emissions are expected to increase, adding to the urgent challenges of climate change, including rising sea levels, higher temperatures, damage to ecosystems, and more extreme weather events.

Among the plastics studied, low-density polyethylene—widely used in single-use items like bags and packaging—releases the highest amounts of these gases. The degradation process in the ocean can amplify emissions by up to 488 times compared to raw plastic pellets, while exposure to sunlight on land leads to even greater releases.

This hidden threat from plastic pollution underscores the need to stop plastic production at its source to prevent further contributions to global warming.
