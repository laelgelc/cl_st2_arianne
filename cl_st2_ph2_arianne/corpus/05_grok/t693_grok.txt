As we face unprecedented heat waves and devastating wildfires around the globe, a recent scientific paper has issued a stark warning about the risk of a "Hothouse Earth." This scenario involves climate feedbacks triggering runaway heating that spirals beyond human control, pushing our planet into irreversible changes.

This dire outlook underscores the failures of current international efforts, including the Paris Accord, which remains non-binding and has proven ineffective. Despite numerous pledges, conferences, and laws aimed at curbing emissions, global emissions continue to rise, with projections pointing to 3-4°C of warming.

Experts are calling attention to scholarly reticence in communicating these risks, alongside broader policy failures. They emphasize the impossibility of decoupling economic growth from fossil fuel dependency, and they urge immediate actions to reduce consumption and slow population growth.

In a notable development, a French minister has resigned in protest over these issues. Meanwhile, young activists are stepping up with powerful responses, including protests, lawsuits, and strikes to demand real change.
