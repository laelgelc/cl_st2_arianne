In the midst of the current energy crisis, women are disproportionately impacted by economic instability. Despite playing a key role in household energy use, they are often excluded from decision-making processes.

Women tend to be more environmentally friendly and show stronger support for renewable energy sources. When in leadership positions, they are associated with improved environmental outcomes. Yet, representation remains low: women hold just 26.8% of environment minister positions in the EU and only 12% of leadership roles in the energy sector.

Energy poverty affects women around the world, exposing them to health risks such as toxic smoke and excess winter deaths. This situation worsens gender inequality.

Access to affordable clean energy is a human right essential for a just transition. Policies must be gender-sensitive to address these challenges.
