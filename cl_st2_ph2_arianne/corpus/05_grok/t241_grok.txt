Climate injustice is a stark reality in our world today, where those who have contributed the least to cumulative greenhouse gas emissions are bearing the brunt of climate change impacts. Communities least responsible are suffering the most from devastating effects like heat waves, droughts, and storms.

The disparities are profound. The United States accounts for over 25% of emissions since the 1750s, while Africa has contributed only 3%. From 1990 to 2015 designates, the wealthiest 5% of the global population caused 36% of emissions, whereas the poorest half contributed less than 6%. Additionally, just twenty companies are linked to over one-third of recent emissions.

Regions like small islands and sub-Saharan Africa are particularly vulnerable, facing existential threats from these changes.

It's time for accountability. Wealthy nations must provide financial aid to those most affected, and policies centered on justice are essential at international events such as the Glasgow conference.
