Every year, the World Economic Forum (WEF) gathers in Davos, where global elites discuss pressing issues like inequality and environmental exploitation. Yet, this event is marred by glaring hypocrisy: attendees often arrive via private jets, which emit massive amounts of CO2, all while they seek capitalist solutions to problems that capitalism itself has exacerbated.

A recent Oxfam report underscores this disconnect, revealing that the richest 1% have captured most of the wealth generated since 2020. The report calls for implementing wealth taxes to address this imbalance.

Instead of relying on profit-driven models, we should turn to Indigenous wisdom and community-focused approaches. It's time to tax the rich, cancel unsustainable debt, prioritize human well-being over GDP growth, and foster multilateral cooperation that centers justice-based solutions.

Innovations from communities in the Global South provide viable alternatives to the status quo. By excluding those most affected by these crises, the WEF undermines its own efforts to find meaningful answers.
