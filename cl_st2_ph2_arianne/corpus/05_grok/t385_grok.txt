In 2013, Super Typhoon Haiyan struck, devastating my hometown in the Philippines right as I was attending UN climate talks. That moment of personal and national tragedy left an indelible mark. Fast forward to 2020, and we're facing Super Typhoon Goni, the strongest storm of the year, hitting amid a series of typhoons battering the Philippines once again.

These events aren't isolated. Around the world, climate emergencies are escalating—wildfires raging in Australia, Brazil, and the US, and devastating floods in East Africa. It's a stark reminder of the global crisis we're in.

Fossil fuel giants like Shell are part of the problem, often shifting the burden of emission reductions onto individuals rather than taking responsibility themselves. We need to hold them accountable. That's why grassroots movements, youth strikes, divestment campaigns, and lawsuits are crucial tools in this fight.

Here in the Philippines, a landmark human rights inquiry is targeting major polluters, seeking justice and pushing for a reduction in dependency on fossil fuels.
