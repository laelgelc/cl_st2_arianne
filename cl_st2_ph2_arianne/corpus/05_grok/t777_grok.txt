Samsung just launched its new S9 smartphone, but it's falling behind on a critical front: sustainability. While rivals like Apple, Google, and Facebook have committed to 100% renewable energy and are making real progress, Samsung is lagging far behind.

A 2015 study found that 66% of customers are willing to pay more for brands that are committed to sustainability. And in a Greenpeace survey of over 8,000 supporters, 85% said they'd be more likely to buy Samsung products if the company took the lead on sustainability.

That's why we're calling on you to take action. Head over to Samsung's Facebook page and post a comment demanding that the company switch to renewable energy.

After all, 80% of the emissions from our gadgets come from the manufacturing process, which is mostly powered by dirty coal and gas. Samsung currently uses only 1% renewable energy, and the electricity used to produce its smartphones from 2007 to 2017 was equivalent to Japan's annual electricity consumption. This comes at a time when 1.53 billion phones were sold last year, leading to massive resource waste and e-waste problems.
