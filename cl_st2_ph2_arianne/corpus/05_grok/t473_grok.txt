As a child growing up in Cameroon, I have fond memories of playing in the forests, collecting fruits and herbs, and finding a deep sense of peace among the trees. My birthday even falls on the International Day of Forests, which always felt like a special connection to these vital ecosystems.

Now, as a campaigner with Greenpeace Africa, I'm dedicated to fighting the destruction of forests to make way for monoculture plantations. These plantations release carbon into the atmosphere, put communities and species at risk, and can never truly replace the rich biodiversity and medicinal value of natural forests.

I see through the greenwashing tactics used by industries that try to offset their emissions by planting artificial monocultures. It's crucial that we recognize the rights of Indigenous peoples and ensure their inclusion in policy decisions. The logging that's displacing people, altering the climate, and shattering community harmony only benefits a few outsiders, leaving lasting damage in its wake.
