Greenpeace Executive Directors Jennifer Morgan and Bunny McDiarmid recently discussed the annual global leadership meeting, with a key focus on #TimesUp: Justice, Safety, and Diversity. Building on reflections from the #MeToo movement, participants unanimously agreed on several important steps forward.

These include creating dedicated reporting spaces for victims of sexual harassment, establishing a specialized complaints team, and investing in comprehensive trainings on harassment prevention, unconscious bias, and diversity. The organization is aiming to achieve 50% women in senior leadership roles. Additionally, efforts will improve global integrity systems by October 2018.

Anti-harassment policies are being strengthened, with a zero-tolerance approach to bullying, discrimination, or harassment. This ensures thorough investigations and appropriate actions in response. Overall, there is a strong commitment to addressing equity and creating safe spaces within the organization.
