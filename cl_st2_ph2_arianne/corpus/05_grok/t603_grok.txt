In April 2019, with Arctic temperatures soaring 8 degrees above normal, Greenpeace brought together a unique concert to draw attention to the fragility of the region and its vulnerability to melting. We organized the event using instruments carefully carved from glacier ice, emphasizing the urgent threats facing this icy landscape.

Oceans campaigner Halvard Haga Raavand led the initiative, where musicians performed on chimes, horns, percussion, and a cello. They played in bone-chilling -12°C conditions, creating sounds that echoed the call for action. Through this concert, we urged world leaders to commit to protecting 30% of the global oceans by 2030.

Oceans play a vital role in absorbing carbon through marine life, serving as a crucial buffer against climate change. At the same time, the melting of Arctic ice is speeding up global warming, making protection efforts more critical than ever.

This concert marked the beginning of our research voyage to the Antarctic, where we advocated for a Global Oceans Treaty to safeguard these essential ecosystems.
