Six months ago, I visited the Geraizeiros community in Bahia, Brazil, along with some journalists. While we were there, armed men who posed as police arrived and intimidated us with assault rifles. They demanded entry without showing any warrants or identification. After two hours, they finally left, but not before threatening to return, which left the entire community living in fear.

This incident is a stark example of the ongoing violence tied to agribusiness expansion in the region. Companies like Agronegócio Estrondo have deforested huge areas to make way for soya farming, invading the traditional lands of communities like the Geraizeiros. The soya produced there is sold to major traders such as Cargill and Bunge, who in turn supply fast food chains.

These events underscore the deep connections between human rights abuses and environmental destruction. It's time to demand change.
