This World Oceans Day, Greenpeace called on supporters around the world to paint themselves blue and form human waves as a vibrant way to push for ocean protection. From Russia to Senegal, New Zealand to Chile, Bulgaria to Thailand, and even in Antarctica, participants in 25 countries spanning all seven continents took part in these fun and creative actions. Through these efforts, they sent a clear message to world leaders about the critical importance of our oceans.
