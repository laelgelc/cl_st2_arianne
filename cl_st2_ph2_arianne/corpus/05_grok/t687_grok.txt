At Greenpeace, we're relentlessly fighting back against the destruction of forests driven by palm oil production. Major brands like KitKat, Colgate, Dove, and others are sourcing from 24 out of 25 notorious Southeast Asian companies. These companies have destroyed over 130,000 hectares of rainforest since 2015, while also being linked to worker exploitation, community conflicts, illegal deforestation, and fires.

Back in 2010, these brands promised to buy only from responsible suppliers, but they're still using "dirty" palm oil through the trader Wilmar. It's time for these brands to prove that their sourcing isn't contributing to destruction. We urge the public to take action and join us in holding them accountable.
