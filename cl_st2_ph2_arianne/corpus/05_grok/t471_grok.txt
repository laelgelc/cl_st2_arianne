In a recent letter, Greenpeace leaders Jennifer Morgan and Anabella Rosemberg highlight how the choices made during the COVID-19 crisis will profoundly shape the ongoing climate emergency. They urge governments and societies to invest in public and planetary health to enable a just transition, steering clear of supporting planet-wrecking industries.

The leaders call for vigilance against those who might exploit the situation, referencing the 'shock doctrine' as a tactic to watch out for. Instead, they advocate building a cooperative and egalitarian future that exists in harmony with nature.

Addressing the virus itself, they emphasize that it requires responses rooted in community and compassion, rather than blame. The focus should be on protecting the vulnerable and drawing deep lessons from this experience.

On a personal note, Morgan and Rosemberg share the challenges their families are facing amid the crisis, pointing to acts of courage that inspire them. They stress the importance of prioritizing care in these times, all while staying vigilant.
