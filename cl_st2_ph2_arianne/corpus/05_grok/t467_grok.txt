As we navigate the intertwined health and economic crises brought on by COVID-19, these challenges are deepening the chronic climate crisis we already face. Now is the time to prevent investments in destructive industries and instead direct public funds toward public health, planetary well-being, and a just transition to a harmonious, equitable future.

We must hold our leaders accountable and remain vigilant against exploitation through the 'shock doctrine,' where crises are used to push harmful agendas. Let's advocate for cooperative, nature-aligned investments that support a better path forward.

In combating the virus, let's draw on compassion, courage, and community, without resorting to blame or division. This moment offers lessons in protecting the vulnerable, building alliances, and prioritizing family and self-care.

Crises like this make the impossible possible—for better or worse. Let's choose the path that leads to positive change.
