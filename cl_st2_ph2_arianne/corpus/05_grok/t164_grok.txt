Our current economic system is deeply flawed, built on foundations of inequality, overconsumption, infinite growth, and unsustainable resource extraction. These elements are driving devastating crises, including climate change and biodiversity loss, pushing our planet to the brink.

Governments are worsening the problem by misallocating billions of dollars to subsidize fossil fuels rather than investing in renewable energy sources. If these subsidies were removed, global emissions could be reduced by up to 10% by 2030.

We need a radical transformation to break free from this destructive path. It's time to reimagine an equitable economic system that operates within planetary boundaries, one that prioritizes people and nature over profit. This can be achieved through public investments in sustainable infrastructure, food systems, energy, and mobility.

Let's come together to envision these alternatives, building a future rooted in solidarity and harmony.
