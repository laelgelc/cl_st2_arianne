At COP27, agribusiness companies launched "The Roadmap to 1.5," but this initiative amounts to nothing more than hollow pledges and greenwashing. It completely ignores the human rights abuses and labor violations that plague commodity production.

We've seen this before. Companies like JBS, Marfrig, Cargill, and Wilmar have made deforestation commitments in the past, yet they've failed to deliver. Destruction continues unabated in critical regions such as the Amazon, Cerrado, and Great Chaco.

What we need are real, transformative changes. That means protecting ecosystems and ensuring companies fund restoration efforts. It requires reducing demand for meat and biofuels, enforcing supply chain transparency, and suspending those responsible for destruction. Above all, it demands respect for Indigenous rights—and none of this should rely on carbon credits.
