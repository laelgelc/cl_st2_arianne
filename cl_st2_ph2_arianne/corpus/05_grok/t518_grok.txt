Indonesia is once again shrouded in a smoky haze from raging fires, leading to severe health problems for millions and releasing massive amounts of CO2 into the atmosphere. These fires are closely tied to palm oil production and rampant deforestation.

Greenpeace campaigner Annisa Rahmawati has called out major companies including Unilever, Mondelez, Nestle, and P&G for their connections to nearly 10,000 fire hotspots in 2019 and over 200,000 hectares of burned land between 2015 and 2018, even though these companies have made commitments to no-deforestation policies.

The situation highlights failures in implementation, such as with Wilmar, which has not fully enforced its No Deforestation, No Peat, No Exploitation (NDPE) policy. For instance, Wilmar initially suspended purchases from the problematic supplier GAMA/KPN but later resumed them.

Due to a lack of agreement on transparency, Greenpeace has withdrawn from collaborative monitoring efforts. We are urging these companies to strictly enforce responsible sourcing practices or to abandon high-risk commodities altogether.
