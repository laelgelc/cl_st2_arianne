Froilan Grate has witnessed firsthand the devastating impact of plastic pollution, tracing its roots back to multinational companies' decisions to flood areas like the Philippines with single-use plastics, despite the lack of proper waste infrastructure. Raised in the pristine environment of Guimaras, he was stunned by the sight of Manila Bay overwhelmed with plastic waste. This experience led him to join GAIA, where he has worked to advance zero waste programs that empower communities to cut waste by up to 80% through methods like segregation, composting, and recycling.

Yet, even with these efforts, about 30% of the waste proves unmanageable, prompting communities to call on corporations such as Nestlé and Unilever to halt production of these problematic plastics. To amplify this message, Grate is now participating in Greenpeace's global ship tour, aimed at holding these companies accountable and pushing for genuine solutions rather than superficial commitments. This initiative is part of the broader Break Free From Plastic movement, uniting efforts to combat plastic pollution worldwide.
