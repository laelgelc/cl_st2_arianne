Indigenous Karen leaders Prasert Pukad, Gip Tonnampetch, and Phanomphon Wanakhunsiri recently took a stand at Bangkok's Government House, protesting to demand recognition of their ancestral rights in Bang Kloi – Jai Paen Din, an area within Kaeng Krachan National Park. These leaders represent a community that has sustainably inhabited and guarded the forests for generations, long before the park was established in 1981. Their traditional practices include shifting cultivation, accompanied by rituals that honor Mother Earth.

The protesters have highlighted the government's evictions, abuses, and lack of consultation with their community. They are vowing to continue fighting for self-determination in their ancestral lands.

Greenpeace Thailand stands in support of these indigenous leaders, underscoring that recognizing indigenous rights is essential for effective environmental conservation.
