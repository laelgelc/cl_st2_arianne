Greenpeace has been harnessing the power of art and creativity for over 50 years to inspire people to take action on environmental issues, from plastic pollution and deforestation to climate change. We've brought these problems to life through striking and imaginative projects around the world.

In Malaysia and cities globally, we've created murals to rally protection for rainforests threatened by palm oil destruction. Our African Trash Masks ads have spotlighted the fight against waste. In Taiwan, an aerial dance performance illustrated marine animals suffocating from plastic pollution. We've even turned sounds from the Papuan rainforest into a dance track to draw attention to its preservation.

At Italy's Viareggio Carnival, a massive whale sculpture choked with plastic highlighted ocean pollution. Melting penguin ice sculptures have appeared worldwide to call for ocean protection. In Brazil, a symbolic march protested mining activities. In Thailand, rice field art has promoted sustainable farming practices. And on Arctic ice, a melting version of the Vitruvian Man urged urgent action on climate change.
