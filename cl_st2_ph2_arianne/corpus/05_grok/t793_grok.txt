Jennifer Morgan has been drawing attention to the shocking levels of plastic pollution in our oceans, and she's spotlighting Taiwan's ongoing efforts to tackle this crisis. Back in 2002, Taiwan implemented a ban on free plastic bags in mainstream shops, which marked a significant step forward, although small businesses continue to use them. She's also shining a light on inspiring local innovations that promote plastic-free living, showing what's possible at the community level. To build on this, she urges the government to adopt policies that would phase out single-use plastics entirely by 2025.

Beyond plastics, the discussion turns to Taiwan's carbon emissions, which are on the rise largely due to reliance on coal power. This trend is at odds with the country's pledge to cut emissions by 50% by 2030. Looking ahead, Taiwan's energy goals include reaching 20% renewables, 30% coal, and 50% gas by 2025, while phasing out nuclear power. However, to achieve a just transition, there's a clear need to speed up the shift toward 100% renewables.
