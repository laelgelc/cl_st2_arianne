In Berlin, a powerful wave of 18,000 people took to the streets to protest against industrial agriculture, calling out its reliance on pesticides, pollution, genetic engineering, land grabbing, animal mistreatment, and control over food systems. As Dirk Zimmermann, Greenpeace Germany's senior food campaigner, pointed out, this marks the seventh annual demonstration and stands as one of Europe's largest, echoing demands for change that resonate around the world.

A Greenpeace study reveals that Germany has the potential to fully transition to ecological agriculture by 2050, enabling the country to feed 76 million people with high-quality food produced mostly domestically. To make this vision a reality, key political measures are essential, such as redirecting subsidies and enhancing livestock practices. On a personal level, actions like halving meat consumption and production can help minimize environmental harm, while cutting food waste by 50% and supporting fair prices for farmers will also play crucial roles.
