I rely heavily on my phone for daily tasks, and I view technology as a force for good. However, treating electronics as disposable leads to short lifespans and rising e-waste—48.9 million tonnes in 2012, projected to reach 65.4 million by next year. Manufacturing gadgets is resource-intensive, using 40 elements and vast water. As iFixit's CEO, I promote repairing devices to reduce waste, empowering people through free tutorials, fixing old gadgets, upgrading computers, and buying repairable products.
