At COP27, the conference marks the first time with a strong focus on food and agriculture. Biodiversity discussions remain uncertain, while Indigenous Peoples demand inclusion to protect the earth amid challenges.

Amid Africa's food crisis from rising grain prices, a ministerial panel highlighted the need to shift from monoculture to agroecological solutions supporting small-scale farmers and communities.

However, polluting countries are delaying financial mechanisms for adaptation, mitigation, and loss and damage, evading responsibility for emissions.

We call for urgent action on global funds, technical exchanges, ending deforestation and industrial fishing, advancing Article 6.8 and Koronivia work, and prioritizing Indigenous involvement to influence COP15 outcomes.
