I've seen firsthand the devastating impact of the fashion industry's waste. During a visit to Kenya, I witnessed mountains of discarded clothes piling up, a stark reminder of the environmental toll of overproduction and fast fashion.

This year marks the 10th anniversary of the Rana Plaza disaster in Bangladesh, where 1,134 garment workers lost their lives in a factory collapse. It's a tragic symbol of the social failures in the industry, where workers' lives are too often sacrificed for cheap clothing.

Amid these issues, greenwashing is rampant. Brands slap on labels like 'Sustainable' and 'Green' to mislead consumers. A new Greenpeace report reveals that most of these claims are unsubstantiated, lacking real evidence of environmental benefits.

Yet, there are signs of progress. Brands such as Vaude, Coop, Tchibo, H&M, and Calzedonia are making strides in traceability and durability, showing that better practices are possible.

Greenpeace's Detox campaign has long pushed back against toxic chemicals in fashion production, demanding cleaner processes from the industry.

We need greater transparency to hold brands accountable, along with efforts to reduce waste. It's time to move away from fast fashion's linear model—produce, use, discard—and embrace true circularity, where clothes are designed to last and be reused.
