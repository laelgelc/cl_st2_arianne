We mourn the loss of Steve Sawyer, a pivotal leader in Greenpeace, who passed away on July 31, 2019, from lung cancer. As Executive Director of Greenpeace International starting in 1988, he guided the organization through significant victories, including safeguarding Antarctica from oil exploration, advancing the Montreal Protocol to phase out ozone-depleting gases, halting the dumping of radioactive waste at sea, and launching early campaigns against climate change.

In his subsequent role as General Secretary of the Global Wind Energy Council, Sawyer played a key part in expanding global wind power capacity from 74GW to 539GW.

His activism began early, with involvement in the Rainbow Warrior's voyages, such as aiding the relocation of residents from Rongelap atoll and protesting nuclear tests. He survived the 1985 bombing of the ship by French agents.

Sawyer is remembered for his bold leadership, deep appreciation for nature, and personal interests like sailing and playing blues guitar.
