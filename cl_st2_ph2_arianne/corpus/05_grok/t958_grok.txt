Aldi, one of the top ten global retailers with expansion in Germany, Europe, the US, and Australia, has now joined Greenpeace's Detox movement. The company has committed to eliminating hazardous chemicals from its textile products by January 1, 2020.

This step highlights the growing momentum for cleaner production within the discount sector. Aldi joins other companies like Marks & Spencer and Coop, which are demonstrating that sustainable, profitable, and toxic-free business models are possible.

Greenpeace is urging retailers to embrace new business models that prioritize responsible resource management and product redesign, beginning with toxic-free manufacturing.

By acknowledging its responsibility across the product lifecycle, Aldi is contributing to a significant victory for the four-year Detox campaign.
