Imagine walking along a pristine beach, only to find the sand and surf littered with microplastics, bags, and cups. This pervasive plastic pollution is contaminating our shores everywhere, turning what should be natural havens into dumping grounds.

Everyone has the right to clean water free from plastic. That's why we're urging that 2018 be the year we break free from this crisis.

Single-use plastics, churned out by companies like Coca-Cola and Nestlé, are flooding our oceans, choking marine life, and infiltrating our drinking water and food supplies.

Recycling alone isn't enough—over 90% of plastic isn't recycled, and production keeps rising.

It's time for these corporations to reduce their plastic output. Join the global movement: sign our petitions and stay tuned for upcoming tools to help make a difference.
