Europe's addiction to synthetic pesticides is wreaking havoc on the environment, as detailed in our latest Greenpeace report. These chemicals are driving ecosystem collapse and significant biodiversity loss, with 24% of species in the EU now threatened. They also disrupt essential services such as pollination and soil fertility, undermining the natural systems we all depend on.

The report uncovers critical gaps in the regulatory system, including a heavy reliance on modeling rather than actual field data, and testing that's led by industry and focused only on active ingredients. Even with existing regulations in place, synthetic pesticides continue to pose unacceptable risks to the environment and beyond.

It's time for a fundamental change. The report calls for a transition to ecological farming practices that blend scientific knowledge with respect for nature, empower local communities to take control, and redirect subsidies to support this shift.

Join us in taking action through #iKnowWhoGrewIt to break the vicious cycle of pesticide dependency and advance chemical-free agriculture.
