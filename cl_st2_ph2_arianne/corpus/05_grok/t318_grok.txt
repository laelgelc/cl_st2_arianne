Greenpeace's iconic ship, the Rainbow Warrior, has journeyed to the Clarion Clipperton Zone in the Pacific Ocean to witness firsthand and expose the serious risks posed by deep sea mining operations conducted by companies such as The Metals Company and GSR. During this expedition, our team observed GSR's 25-tonne prototype mining machine disconnecting and becoming stuck on the seabed amid testing activities, while sediment clouds rose from the disturbance of the seafloor.

Activists on board, including Fijian Victor Pickering, are actively protesting against this industry's threats to ocean wildlife, the livelihoods of Pacific communities, and the ocean's vital role in carbon storage, especially in the context of the ongoing climate crisis. In a bold move, Greenpeace activists painted the word "RISK" on GSR's vessel to highlight these dangers.

Greenpeace is calling for the establishment of a Global Ocean Treaty that would create protected sanctuaries in the high seas, and we urge millions of people worldwide to join us in opposing deep sea mining and supporting this critical initiative.
