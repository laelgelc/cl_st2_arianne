World Cities Day, observed on October 31, underscores that over half of humanity currently lives in urban areas. Projections indicate significant growth in these populations, particularly in Latin America, the Caribbean, Africa, and Asia by 2050. This reality calls for cities to evolve into vital hubs of climate action, resilience, and justice.

At the heart of this transformation is #UrbanJustice, which centers on communities most affected by climate challenges. Through collective efforts, these communities are reshaping urban spaces, mindsets, and policies to advance climate justice.

Inspiring examples highlight this movement. Mangala has launched a cycling initiative in her city to tackle air pollution. In Bogota, José leads street cleaning efforts to promote inclusivity. Kusum's #PowerThePedal movement in India advocates for sustainable mobility. Dilruba is advancing gender equality in Istanbul. Meanwhile, Mexico City's chinampas provide solutions for water access and flood prevention.

Ultimately, #UrbanJustice represents the intersection of social and climate justice, driving meaningful change in our urban landscapes.
