I recently embarked on an unforgettable expedition to Antarctica aboard Greenpeace's ship, the Arctic Sunrise. The scenery was nothing short of stunning, with vast penguin colonies dotting pebble beaches and glittering ice floes stretching out across the horizon.

During my time there, I witnessed firsthand the profound impacts of climate change. Events like the calving of the massive Larsen C iceberg highlighted the rapid changes, alongside widespread melting ice that poses serious threats to local ecosystems and species, such as the uniquely adapted moss that clings to life in this harsh environment.

Daily life on the ship was a mix of routine and unpredictability. We spent time cleaning the vessel, attending meetings, and engaging in activities that were often dictated by the weather. Seasickness was a common challenge amid the rough conditions.

Observing the penguins in their natural habitat was particularly moving. They appeared strong and resilient, yet their fragility in the face of environmental pressures inspired a deep sense of urgency to protect them.

Greenpeace's work during the expedition included conducting research with submersibles in the Weddell Sea, where we aimed to identify new species. This research supports the push for an Antarctic Ocean Sanctuary, which would help safeguard the region's wildlife from the threats posed by industrial krill fishing.

My journey to Antarctica started from Seoul and was arduous, but ultimately incredibly rewarding.
