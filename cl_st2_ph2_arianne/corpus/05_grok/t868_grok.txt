Samsung is recalling 4.3 million Galaxy Note 7 phones following nearly 100 reported cases of explosions. This recall involves an amount of technology equivalent to 730,000 kilograms. The company has stated it will dispose of these phones without repairing, refurbishing, or reselling them. Samsung sold 1.8 million of these devices across 10 countries and is now collecting them from customers worldwide.

At Greenpeace, we are calling on Samsung to be transparent by publicly sharing its disposal plans for these recalled phones. It is crucial to avoid methods like dumping or burning, which would lead to unnecessary waste and environmental damage. Instead, the focus should be on safely recovering valuable materials such as gold, cobalt, and tungsten through proper dismantling and reuse processes.

This situation presents Samsung with an opportunity to take a leading role in advancing innovative design and recycling practices in the electronics industry.
