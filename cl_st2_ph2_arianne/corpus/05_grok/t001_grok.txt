Roger Payne, who passed away in 2023 at the age of 88, made a profound impact on ocean conservation through his groundbreaking work. In 1970, he recorded "Songs of the Humpback Whale," an album that sold over 100,000 copies and sparked the global anti-whaling movement, including inspiring Greenpeace's efforts.

Payne's contributions extended to founding Ocean Alliance and playing a key role in securing the 1982 moratorium on commercial whaling. Greenpeace activist Rémi Parmentier incorporated the album into campaigns, arranging its release in France in 1978 to support the Rainbow Warrior's missions against whaling.

Kelly Rigg remembers Payne's testimony in 1982, where he spoke out against offshore oil drilling and showed notable respect for young campaigners involved in the cause.

Through his empathetic approach to listening to both whales and humans, Payne helped foster a deeper human connection to the natural world.
