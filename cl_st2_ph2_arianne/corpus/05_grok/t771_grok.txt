Greenpeace is joining an Indigenous-led movement to stop Kinder Morgan's oil pipeline on Canada's Pacific coast. Indigenous leaders, including Elder Ta’ah and Will George, will gather with allies to build a traditional Coast Salish "watch house" over two days to resist construction. The pipeline threatens Indigenous lands, water, communities, and endangered orcas by transporting dirty tar sands oil, exacerbating climate change without full Indigenous consent. The mobilization aims to protect the ocean, wildlife, and livelihoods from fossil fuel expansion. Greenpeace calls on people worldwide to join.
