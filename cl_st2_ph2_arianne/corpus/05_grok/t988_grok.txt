The Antarctic is far from a sterile environment; it teems with diverse marine life, including whales, orcas, seals, fish, seabirds, and unique seafloor species. This makes it the world's last wild frontier, one that needs urgent protection.

Rapid warming on the Antarctic Peninsula is affecting sea ice and krill, which forms the foundation of the food web, while industrial fishing is depleting stocks.

The Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) can establish marine reserves, but progress has been slow since a 2009 agreement.

The Antarctic Ocean Alliance's new publication proposes a network of 19 reserves covering over 40% of the Southern Ocean.

At the October 2012 CCAMLR meeting, members can create this network, inspiring global high-seas protection.
