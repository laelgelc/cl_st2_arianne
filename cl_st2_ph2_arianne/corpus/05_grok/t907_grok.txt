On World Tuna Day, Greenpeace's ship Esperanza is confronting Thai Union's destructive fishing practices in the Indian Ocean. Thai Union, owner of brands like John West and supplier to Walmart, threatens tuna populations, oceans, and reliant communities. Key issues include: FADs causing 104,000 tonnes of bycatch annually, including silky sharks; foreign vessels depleting local tuna stocks and economies; record 4.8 million tonnes caught in 2014, with three-quarters of bigeye and yellowfin overfished; and unregulated FADs polluting with plastics and batteries, washing onto beaches and reefs. Citizens have linked found gear to Thai Union.
