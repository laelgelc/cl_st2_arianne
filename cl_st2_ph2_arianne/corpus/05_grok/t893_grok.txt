Repsol's recent departure from the Chukchi Sea has left Shell as the sole leaseholder in US Arctic waters. This development underscores why an Arctic oil boom never materialized, hampered by strict regulations, low oil prices, high costs, and extensive ice coverage.

The risks are profound, with inevitable oil spills that are impossible to clean up in the extreme Arctic conditions. Local communities have voiced strong opposition, and these activities pose broader dangers to climate change.

Historical lease rushes in the 1980s-90s and in 2008 led to failures and billions wasted, as exemplified by Shell's 2012 mishap.

It's time to take action to end new US offshore drilling leases.
