In a shocking revelation from our latest Greenpeace report, "Food Injustice 2020-22," we've uncovered how 20 major agribusiness corporations operating in the grain, fertiliser, meat, and dairy sectors took advantage of the COVID-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine to rake in massive profits. These companies distributed a staggering $53.5 billion in shareholder payouts during 2020-2021 alone. To put that into perspective, this amount surpasses the United Nations' estimated $51.5 billion needed to provide essential aid to 230 million vulnerable people around the world.

The root of this injustice lies in the high level of market concentration among these firms. This dominance allows them to control global supply chains and withhold critical information, which in turn drives up prices and boosts their profits at the expense of those who can least afford it.

It's time for a fundamental shift toward food sovereignty, where power is returned to small-scale farmers who can sustain communities and the environment. We must implement key measures like universal basic income, windfall taxes, and dividend taxation to tackle these inequities head-on. By doing so, we can work to end hunger and advance social justice, especially as climate crises continue to intensify the challenges we face.
