On this International Day of Forests, Greenpeace is highlighting the essential role forests play in sustaining life on our planet and urging stronger campaigns to protect them. Forests are crucial for absorbing and storing nearly 300 billion tonnes of carbon, yet deforestation contributes to 12% of global greenhouse gas emissions.

Extinction rates have increased dramatically, surging up to a thousand times in recent centuries, and without immediate action, these rates could climb even higher.

Tropical rainforests are particularly vital, hosting 70% of plants with anti-cancer properties and providing about a quarter of conventional medicine drugs.

It's imperative for corporations like Procter & Gamble to tackle forest destruction within their supply chains, while governments must step up to enforce protections.

Already, over 10,000 people are joining the movement by using #StandForForests to advocate for these critical ecosystems.
