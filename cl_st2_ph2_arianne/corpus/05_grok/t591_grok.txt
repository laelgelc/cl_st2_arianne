The 5th Global Sharing Week is here, running from June 16th to 21st, and it's a major event that promotes sharing as a way to build a new system beyond endless consumption and growth. This endless consumption and growth is harming the planet through climate crises like heatwaves and floods.

Did you know that 70% of global emissions stem from urban consumption? That's where sharing comes in—through activities like fixing, making, mending, and community events, it reduces emissions, conserves resources, and fosters innovation and collectivity.

Sharing Week reaches over 100 million people annually, and in 2018, MAKE SMTHNG spanned 48 countries. Let's unite climate activists with makers and sharers for bottom-up change. Join in by participating in local events!
