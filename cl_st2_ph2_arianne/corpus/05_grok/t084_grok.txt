Europe is grappling with a volatile energy crisis driven by war, soaring prices, inflation, recession, and escalating climate challenges. This situation threatens to plunge many into energy poverty as winter approaches.

To address this, we must urgently reduce our reliance on gas, oil, and electricity. This includes prioritizing cuts in industry through rationing and mandatory measures, similar to the Netherlands' implementation of a 25% reduction in gas use.

In the transport sector, reforms are essential: introducing affordable public transport tickets, banning short-haul flights and private jets, and encouraging efficient driving practices. These steps can save oil, cut emissions, and deliver savings of up to €63 billion.

We should also promote the adoption of heat pumps, better insulation, and solar energy solutions. Additionally, taxing the windfall profits of fossil fuel companies can provide crucial support to vulnerable households.

Finally, it's time to end subsidies for fossil fuels and halt their expansion, paving the way for a just transition to 100% renewable energy.
