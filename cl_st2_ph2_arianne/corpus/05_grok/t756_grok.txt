The Karipuna Indigenous people in Rondônia, Brazil, have only 58 members remaining. They face severe threats from illegal loggers and land grabbers who are invading their 152,930-hectare protected territory in the Amazon, which was ratified in 1998. Surrounded by deforestation and cattle farms, the Karipuna endure death threats in Brazil, which is the deadliest country for environmental defenders. A FUNAI office was recently burned, leaving them vulnerable. Over 1,000 hectares of their land were deforested in early 2017. In collaboration with Greenpeace Brazil and CIMI, the Karipuna are using satellite monitoring to combat these invasions. Their leader, Adriano, will address the UN in New York to amplify their plight and protect their community and forest.
