Greenpeace has uncovered a disturbing environmental and health issue in China: a massive black wastewater plume stretching off the coast of Shishi, originating from the Wubao Dyeing Industrial zone. This pollution is directly tied to the production of children's clothing.

Our investigations revealed hazardous chemicals, including nonylphenol, chlorinated anilines, and antimony, present in the wastewater discharges and even lingering as residues in exported children's clothes from Shishi and Zhili. These substances pose serious health risks to children, potentially disrupting their hormones and development.

The problem is exacerbated by China's lack of strict regulations on such discharges, leading to numerous coastal points where illegal pollution occurs unchecked.

Greenpeace is calling on the Chinese government to implement policies that require full chemical disclosure. We're also urging major brands like Adidas and Disney to take immediate action to detoxify their supply chains, joining leaders such as Zara and Mango in committing to safer practices.
