At a recent shareholder meeting in Stockholm, Greenpeace presented Essity CEO Magnus Groth with the 'Golden Chainsaw Award' to highlight the company's failure to protect old-growth forests. As Europe's largest tissue producer, Essity is behind popular brands such as Tempo and Velvet, and it sources pulp from SCA, a supplier that destroys forests essential to Sámi reindeer herders through practices like planting invasive lodgepole pine.

This action comes amid ongoing concerns, including a 2017 petition that gathered nearly 250,000 signatures calling for change. Despite Essity's own claims of sustainability, the company has responded with delays, meetings, and requests for more time, while disregarding demands from the Swedish Sámi association (SSR) and Greenpeace to stop the destruction.
