The COVID-19 pandemic has intensified food insecurity, compounding existing issues of inequality and climate crises. Warnings highlight potential disruptions that could impact billions of people worldwide.

At the heart of this problem lies a broken industrial food system, heavily influenced by corporate interests. This system results in massive food waste even as millions suffer from hunger.

To address these challenges, there is a strong push for food justice and sovereignty. This includes recognizing and valuing the essential workers in the food sector. Social measures, such as universal basic income, are proposed to provide support. Policies need to be redirected toward building ecological resilience.

On a practical level, actions can focus on reducing food waste and transitioning to plant-based diets sourced locally. Supporting urban agriculture and community-supported farming initiatives are key steps forward.

Governments should view food as a common good and allocate funding for these transitions. Examples include food-growing initiatives in Victoria, Canada, which demonstrate successful community-based approaches.
