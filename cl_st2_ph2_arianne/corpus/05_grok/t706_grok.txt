Recent extreme weather events are striking hard across the globe, from floods and typhoons in Japan to heatwaves and floods in Europe, and wildfires in California. These disasters serve as stark evidence of human-induced climate change, fueled by rising CO2 emissions and shifts in the jet stream.

The human toll has been devastating. In Japan, children have lost their lives to floods and typhoons. In Greece, children have also perished amid floods and heatwaves. In California, firefighters have died battling wildfires. These tragedies unfold against a backdrop of accelerating ice melt in Antarctica and the death of ancient trees.

The world remains off track from the Paris Agreement goals, on a path toward 3°C of warming. However, an upcoming IPCC report emphasizes the critical need to limit warming to 1.5°C. This can be achieved through urgent shifts away from fossil fuels and enhanced protections for oceans, forests, and farming.

It's time for leaders to take immediate action to ensure climate justice.
