For 50 years, the oil industry has boomed in Scotland, but it's now changing, resulting in rising unemployment among workers, increased food bank usage, and community losses. As Greenpeace UK's digital campaigner, Ravishaan Rahel Muthiah, I work towards a just transition to clean energy and green jobs.

Greenpeace interviewed current and former oil workers to share their experiences. Wullie spoke about the hardships of offshore work, redundancies, and health impacts. Robbie discussed barriers to transition, such as high training fees. Yvonne emphasized the government's need to prioritize the planet over oil profits. Alan expressed hope for a future in renewables.

These stories highlight common challenges faced by workers tied to polluting industries, who shouldn't bear the burden of the climate crisis. Greenpeace UK, together with Friends of the Earth Scotland and Platform, campaigns for supported transitions to secure green jobs.
