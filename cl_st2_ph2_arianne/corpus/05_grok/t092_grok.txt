The 27th UN Climate Change Conference, known as COP27, has wrapped up after intense overtime negotiations. One major outcome was the establishment of a Loss and Damage fund designed to support communities hit hard by climate impacts, standing out as a significant victory even in the midst of various disappointments.

However, there was no agreement on phasing out fossil fuels, despite strong calls from numerous countries. This shortfall ramps up the pressure heading into COP28.

Dubbed the 'implementation' COP and the 'Africa COP,' the conference fell short on delivering stronger national plans to cap global warming at 1.5°C, which could signal a step back from the goals set in the Paris Agreement.

The need for urgent action persists, with polluters stepping up to finance adaptation, mitigation efforts, and a just transition. As we look ahead, the power of people will continue to drive progress at next year's gathering in the UAE.
