The latest findings from the IPCC's Sixth Assessment Report paint a stark picture of our changing climate. Human-caused climate change is intensifying weather extremes around the world, leading to widespread impacts on ecosystems and vulnerable communities. These communities bear the brunt of the suffering, even though they contribute the least to the problem.

The report reveals that risks are escalating at lower levels of warming than scientists previously believed. If we stay on our current path, we're headed toward 3°C of warming by 2100, which could result in irreversible losses such as melting ice sheets and species extinction.

Yet, there's still hope. The report emphasizes that limiting warming to 1.5°C is achievable if we act urgently. This requires halving emissions by 2030, phasing out fossil fuels rapidly, shifting to renewable energy, restoring ecosystems, and ensuring equitable finance. To secure a sustainable future, we need transformative and inclusive changes across every sector.
