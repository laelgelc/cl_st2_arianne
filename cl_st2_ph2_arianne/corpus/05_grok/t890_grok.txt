In the vast, icy expanse of the Arctic, our Greenpeace ship, the Arctic Sunrise, has been carrying a powerful chorus of voices—messages from eight million people around the world calling for the protection of this fragile region from oil drilling and destructive fishing.

Joining this effort in Svalbard was the renowned pianist Ludovico Einaudi, who composed and performed a haunting piece titled "Elegy for the Arctic." Set amid floating ice and a towering glacier, his performance served to amplify these global calls for action.

This event was carefully timed to coincide with the OSPAR Commission meeting in Tenerife, where it supports a crucial proposal to safeguard 10% of the Arctic Ocean. The urgency is heightened by the rapid melting of ice in the area, even as opposition comes from Norway, Denmark, and Iceland, swayed by corporate interests.

At stake are the Arctic's unique wildlife, its vital role in regulating the global climate, the well-being of future generations, and the need to guard this pristine environment against greed.
