In cities overwhelmed by cars, mobility challenges are creating serious problems for the climate and everyday urban life. Greenpeace has been vocal in criticizing car manufacturers like Volkswagen for contributing to these issues.

We hear from six women whose experiences bring these challenges to light. Mothers describe navigating unsafe sidewalks and the scarcity of open spaces where children can play safely. Disabled women face inaccessible parking spots and constant obstacles that make getting around difficult. Others who depend on public transport or cycling share stories of enduring long waits, safety risks, and inadequate infrastructure.

It's time for ambitious policies that prioritize better public transport, more green spaces, and universal accessibility. These changes would enhance life for everyone, particularly for vulnerable groups.
