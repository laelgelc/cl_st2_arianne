There's a remarkable global shift underway, moving away from coal—the primary energy source since 2003 and the largest emitter of CO2, with mining also releasing methane. Even as politicians like Trump push to bolster fossil fuels, fresh research from Greenpeace and CoalSwarm reveals that 23 countries, states, and cities are committing to phase out coal by 2030. This includes three G7 economies and potentially Italy, leading to 370 coal plants being shut down or avoided—enough to power the equivalent of six UKs and retire half a trillion USD in assets. Around the world, protests are amplifying the call for change, from activists at the UK's Kingsnorth to those fighting for clean air in Delhi, all demanding a swift transition to renewables.
