Four years after Angela Merkel committed Germany to a 40% greenhouse gas emissions cut by 2020 at the Paris Climate Agreement, three organic farming families—the Blohms, Lütke Schwienhorsts, and Backsens—are taking a bold step by suing the government for climate inaction. This lawsuit marks the first such federal court defense in the country.

Germany has abandoned its targets amid rising temperatures that are impacting global agriculture. For the Blohms, this means reduced apple yields and pest invasions, which have forced the removal of cherry trees. The Lütke Schwienhorsts are enduring prolonged droughts that threaten their business. Meanwhile, the Backsens are confronting rising sea levels that endanger the future of their island farm.

Supporters are urged to join calls for accountability in holding the government responsible for these failures.
