Following our July ranking of 30 global companies on their progress in phasing out microbeads from personal care products, several companies have responded with commitments to action.

Amway Taiwan will replace microbeads with biodegradable ingredients from October 1, 2016, in its sole affected product. LG H&H commits to stopping use by the end of 2016. A Japanese company pledges phase-out by June 2018, having switched to plant-derived materials since 2014. Procter & Gamble aims for removal by 2017. Shiseido plans global replacement by 2018. Estee Lauder expanded its commitment.

We urge faster action against plastic pollution, government bans, and consumer steps like checking ingredients and supporting campaigns.
