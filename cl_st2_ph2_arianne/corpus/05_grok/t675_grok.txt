This past week has been a turning point in the fight against climate change, beginning with the release of the IPCC report that calls on governments to take immediate action to prevent a climate catastrophe. Among the standout developments were several court decisions pushing for cleaner air and energy: a ruling in the Netherlands mandating the closure of coal plants by 2020, bans on diesel cars in Berlin from Germany, and a required air pollution plan in Belgium. In the financial sector, NN Group announced it would stop funding tar sands projects because of their high emissions. On the policy front, the European Parliament endorsed a path to net-zero emissions by 2050, which includes phasing out fossil fuels, increasing energy efficiency, and restoring ecosystems. Meanwhile, political momentum is building with 15 EU countries advocating for more ambitious targets, set against ongoing debates in Germany over coal and protests at the Hambach forest.
