Humanity has now breached four of the nine critical ecological boundaries that sustain life on Earth, with nutrient cycles being one of the key areas pushed beyond safe limits. This overload is evident in our watersheds, where agriculture and runoff dump an estimated 8.5 million tonnes of phosphorus and 54 million tonnes of nitrogen each year. The consequences are severe: eutrophication is creating vast dead zones and triggering mass die-offs in bodies of water, from lakes like Erie to oceans like the Baltic Sea.

In nature, the nitrogen cycle functions through bacteria that fix atmospheric N2, making it available for plants. This process is supported by practices like crop rotation and the role of animals in nutrient distribution. However, human activities have disrupted this balance by doubling nitrogen inputs overall. This has led to increased emissions of N2O, a potent greenhouse gas, along with soil acidification and a decline in biodiversity.

To address these issues and bring nutrient cycles back within planetary boundaries, we can adopt several practical approaches. These include using fertilizers more sparingly to reduce excess application, better managing manure to prevent runoff, employing bioremediation techniques with plants and fungi to clean up affected areas, and restoring natural ecosystems. By doing so, we can work towards respecting the limits set by nature and protecting our planet's vital systems.
