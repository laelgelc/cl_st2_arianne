The global sand crisis is escalating, fueled by rapid urban expansion and soaring construction demands that lead to the extraction of billions of tonnes of sand each year from rivers, lakes, and oceans. This massive harvesting is causing severe environmental damage, including widespread habitat destruction and declines in species such as dolphins, turtles, porpoises, and birds. Erosion is accelerating in affected areas, while saltwater intrusion threatens freshwater sources, and stagnant water from mining sites is breeding grounds for diseases.

Communities reliant on fishing are suffering significant losses, particularly in regions like Cambodia, Vietnam, China, Africa, Mozambique, and India. Infrastructure is also at risk, with incidents of bridge collapses linked to weakened riverbeds from sand removal. Illegal mining operations and unregulated trade are rampant, further intensifying the problem.

Looking ahead, projections show that sand consumption could double by 2060, pushing this crisis toward levels of unsustainable development comparable to over-fishing, where resources are depleted faster than they can replenish.
