In her book excerpt, Vanessa Nakate emphasizes the vital role of education in empowering African women and girls to tackle the climate crisis. Without education, girls often face limited paths, including early marriage, farming, or domestic work. These circumstances leave scant time for activism, compounded by obstacles such as lack of internet access and unstable employment.

The COVID-19 pandemic has worsened the situation by reducing families' ability to afford school fees, threatening to reverse hard-won educational progress. Nakate reflects on her own family's dedication to education, highlighting Uganda's achievement of gender parity in primary schools, though significant disparities persist at higher education levels.

On a global scale, millions of girls are denied schooling, which restricts their ability to participate in decision-making processes related to climate issues.
