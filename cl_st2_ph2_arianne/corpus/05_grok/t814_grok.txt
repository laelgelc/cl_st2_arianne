Greenpeace has been harnessing the power of giant sun symbols to champion renewable energy ever since we displayed one in Paris two years ago during the Climate Conference, calling for a decisive shift away from fossil fuels. Recently, these vibrant suns have popped up in Barcelona, Croatia, and across various European countries including Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Slovenia, and Brussels.

Just last week, 65 activists from five countries came together to unveil a massive "Go solar!" banner right outside the European Commission. This action was a direct call to EU leaders to prioritize renewables and ditch dirty fuels, especially as energy legislation is under review.
