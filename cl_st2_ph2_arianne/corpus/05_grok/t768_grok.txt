In 1992, Greenpeace revolutionized refrigeration by developing GreenFreeze to replace ozone-depleting F-gases used in fridges, which were also potent greenhouse gases. Challenging chemical companies' monopoly, our German team created an efficient prototype using natural hydrocarbons with Foron. Supporters provided 70,000 pre-orders, leading to the first unit in 1993. European firms adopted it within a year, and Greenpeace made it open source, earning a UN award. Today, about one billion GreenFreeze fridges are in use worldwide, with nearly 80% of annual production expected to use the technology by 2020.
