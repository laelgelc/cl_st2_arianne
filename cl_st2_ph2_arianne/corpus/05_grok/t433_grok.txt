The COVID-19 lockdowns brought about a remarkable improvement in air quality around the world. With reduced use of fossil fuels, scaled-back factory operations, and fewer emissions from transportation, skies cleared in many regions. In India, for instance, the Himalayas became visible from distances where they hadn't been seen in decades, while levels of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) dropped significantly in various locations.

However, as restrictions begin to ease, this progress is at risk. Pollution levels are already rebounding in areas such as China and the Philippines, highlighting the temporary nature of these gains without sustained efforts.

To keep the air clean beyond the pandemic, we need to focus on a green recovery. This means directing stimulus packages toward sustainable initiatives while avoiding support for polluting industries. A shift to renewable energy sources is essential, alongside promoting green transportation options like expanded bike lanes and electric vehicles (EVs). Strengthening regulations on emissions will also play a key role in locking in these benefits.

On an individual level, people can contribute by reducing travel and embracing working from home where possible. These actions not only help maintain cleaner air but also underscore the connections between air quality, public health, climate stability, and economic resilience.

At Greenpeace, we're actively campaigning to ensure that clean air is prioritized in post-pandemic recovery plans, pushing for policies that protect our environment and well-being for the long term.
