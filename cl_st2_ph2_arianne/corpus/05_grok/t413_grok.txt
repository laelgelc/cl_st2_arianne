At Greenpeace, we've had the opportunity to interview four talented photographers who are dedicating their long-term projects to documenting the impacts of climate change around the world. Through their lenses, they capture stories of environmental challenges and human responses, shedding light on urgent issues that demand our attention.

Swastik Pal focuses on the Sundarbans, where islanders confront rising seas, increasing salinity, frequent floods, and displacement. His work highlights the resilience of these communities in the face of such threats.

Nadia Bseiso turns her attention to the Fertile Crescent, exploring water scarcity and droughts that plague the region. She questions the very notion of its fertility and advocates for greater awareness of these pressing problems.

Amilton Neves delves into Mozambique's timber industry, examining deforestation and the devastating effects of cyclones. His aim is to promote the preservation of these vital ecosystems.

Agoes Rudianto documents the situation in Jakarta, where sinking land and floods are major concerns. He captures the adaptations being made, such as the construction of sea walls, to cope with these changes.

Collectively, the work of these photographers fosters deeper environmental narratives, emphasizing the need for awareness and action to address climate change.
