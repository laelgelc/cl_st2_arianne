Scientists have reported that the Arctic sea ice minimum has reached its second-lowest level since measurements began, a stark signal of urgent climate breakdown. This alarming development underscores the need to join 3 million people in demanding that governments protect at least 30% of the world's oceans by 2030, especially as the Arctic could become summer ice-free by 2035.

Healthy oceans play a crucial role in storing carbon and building resilience against climate impacts, with the Arctic standing out as a priority area for protection. Greenpeace's Arctic Sunrise ship is on the front lines, witnessing this crisis firsthand.

Marginalized communities, particularly those in the Global South, bear the brunt of ocean destruction and its consequences. It's essential that leaders at the UN Biodiversity Summit take decisive action to protect oceans and the people who depend on them.

We must commit to unrelenting action to safeguard our planet for future generations.
