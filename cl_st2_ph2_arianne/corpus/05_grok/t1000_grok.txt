Bob Hunter, one of the founders of Greenpeace, passed away on May 2, 2005, after a battle with cancer. Born in 1941 in Winnipeg, he began his career as a rebellious journalist. He quit his column at the Vancouver Sun to join the 1971 voyage protesting a U.S. nuclear test off Amchitka Island. It was during this effort that he coined the name "Greenpeace," helping to ignite a worldwide movement for environmental activism.

Serving as Greenpeace's president from 1973 to 1977, Hunter pioneered innovative tactics known as "media mindbombs." These included high-profile actions such as dyeing seal pups to disrupt the fur trade and directly confronting whaling ships on the high seas.

In his later years, Hunter hosted television shows and authored several books, including "Warriors of the Rainbow." Throughout his life, he inspired others with his humor, optimism, and references to the Cree myth of rainbow warriors who would save the world.
