The Great Northern Forest, also known as the boreal forest or Taiga, stretches across a vast green belt encircling the Arctic. This immense woodland plays a vital role in combating climate change by storing more carbon in its soil than tropical forests do. It provides shelter for diverse species, including the Siberian Tiger, bears, and salamanders.

This forest faces extreme seasonal changes, with winters in Siberia plunging to -35°C and summers warming up to 25.5°C. Its wildlife has remarkable adaptations to survive these conditions: animals change color for camouflage, produce antifreeze-like chemicals in their bodies, and enter hibernation. The conifers that dominate the landscape, such as pine and spruce, withstand freezing temperatures thanks to their low-sap needles and shapes that efficiently absorb sunlight.

These ancient trees are essential to protect. Join the effort to safeguard the Great Northern Forest and its invaluable contributions to our planet.
