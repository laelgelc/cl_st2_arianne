Taiwan's coral reefs, known for their incredible diversity, are facing a severe crisis with widespread bleaching events. This alarming phenomenon is being driven by record-high sea temperatures that have surpassed 30°C, a reduction in typhoons that would normally cool the waters, and the ongoing effects of ocean warming linked to climate change.

Compounding these issues are human-related pollutants, including agricultural pesticides, wastewater discharges, and chemicals from harmful sunscreens that are damaging these fragile ecosystems.

The consequences are dire: large-scale coral mortality is occurring, leading to broader ecosystem disruptions. This affects marine life that depends on reefs, diminishes natural protection against coastline erosion, and threatens industries like tourism and fisheries. Recovery is expected to be slow, as corals typically grow at a rate of just 1cm per year.

To prevent further devastation, we need ambitious actions to reduce carbon emissions by transitioning from fossil fuels to sustainable energy sources. Ongoing preservation efforts are essential to fight global warming and ocean acidification, safeguarding these vital reefs for the future.
