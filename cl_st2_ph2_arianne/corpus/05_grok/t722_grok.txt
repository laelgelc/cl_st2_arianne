Samsung Electronics has made a significant commitment to transition to 100% renewable energy in the US, China, and Europe by 2020, covering its manufacturing factories there. This pledge comes in response to Greenpeace's global campaigns pushing for sustainable practices in the tech industry.

As part of its efforts, Samsung plans to install onsite solar and geothermal energy systems near its semiconductor plants in Hwaseong, Pyongtaek, and Suwon in Korea. The company is also supporting South Korea's national target of achieving 20% renewable energy by 2030.

Looking ahead, Samsung will join the CDP supply chain program next year to help manage and mitigate climate risks across its operations.

This move is particularly important given Samsung's substantial energy consumption, which reached 16,000GWh in 2016—an amount equivalent to the entire Dominican Republic's energy use. By committing to renewables, Samsung is helping drive the necessary shift away from fossil fuels.

At Greenpeace, we welcome these steps but urge Samsung to ensure full implementation and to extend its renewable energy commitments to other key regions, such as Vietnam.
