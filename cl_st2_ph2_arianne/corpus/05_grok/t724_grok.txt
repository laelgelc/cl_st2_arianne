Dr. Nate Hagens teaches a course called "Reality 101" at the University of Minnesota. The course explores humanity's predicaments, including economic decline, inequality, pollution, biodiversity loss, and war. It examines these issues through the lenses of systems ecology, neuroscience, and economics.

The course addresses the question "What can I do?" by advocating for non-linear approaches. It emphasizes principles such as building community cohesion, preserving ecosystems, promoting local energy and food systems, accepting complexity, loving nature, and self-improvement, described as "sharpen the sword."

It prioritizes actions like reducing consumption, stabilizing population, cutting energy demand, and ending militarism. Suggested actions include campaigns, local initiatives, education, and resource sharing. The course also provides book recommendations for deeper learning.
