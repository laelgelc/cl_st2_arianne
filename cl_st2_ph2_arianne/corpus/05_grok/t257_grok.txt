During a recent Greenpeace field trip to the Amazon, our team visited Porto Velho, Lábrea, and Humaitá. These visits uncovered the severe impacts of agribusiness expansion in the region. Agroextractivists are facing threats and being forced off their lands due to land accumulation. There are invasions of Indigenous territories, and areas are being prepared for soy plantations after timber removal and cattle ranching.

Infrastructure developments, including new bus lines, highways, and branches, are anticipated to boost deforestation and the flow of people into the area. These changes echo the destructive patterns already seen in the Cerrado and Pará.

Amid the sad reports of violence and burned areas, we encountered advocates for sustainable development, which brings a sense of hope. Join the movement to stand with the guardians of the Amazon.
