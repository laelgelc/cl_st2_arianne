Two years have passed since the tragic Rana Plaza factory collapse in Dhaka, an event that claimed over 1,000 lives and left more than 2,500 people injured. This disaster has shone a stark light on the fashion industry's toxic practices, underscoring the urgent need for sweeping changes.

In response, over 30 companies, including 18 major fashion brands that together represent 10% of the sector, have stepped up by committing to Detox. This initiative focuses on eliminating hazardous chemicals from their operations, resulting in cleaner factories in locations such as China.

Now is the time to ignite a Fashion Revolution. Join the movement by taking simple actions on social media: snap selfies with your clothing labels and use the hashtag #whomademyclothes to push for greater transparency in the industry.

Beyond these steps, the fashion sector must prioritize compensating the victims of such tragedies and fully embrace responsibility for maintaining ethical supply chains.
