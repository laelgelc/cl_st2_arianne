A recent Polish TV investigation has shone a stark light on the horrors of industrial meat production. Diseased cows were shown being dragged to slaughter while in obvious pain, with their rotten meat then distributed without any veterinary checks to 14 European countries. Shockingly, this meat even ended up in school canteens.

This scandal underscores persistent problems in the industry, such as mad cow disease and listeria outbreaks, fueled by a relentless pursuit of profits and inadequate oversight. In Poland, alarmingly high percentages of diseased livestock continue to be approved for human consumption.

The entire system not only endangers public health and inflicts suffering on animals but also wreaks havoc on the environment. It drives deforestation, pollution, and exacerbates the climate crisis.

It's time for change. We need stronger regulations and greater transparency in meat production. Shifting towards plant-based diets is essential. As individuals, we can push for more eco-friendly meals in schools and draw inspiration from the Greenpeace Cookbook to make sustainable choices.
