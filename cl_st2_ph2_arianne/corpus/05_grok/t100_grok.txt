The Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region is facing severe impacts from the climate crisis, with lives lost, homes destroyed, crops failing, and livelihoods threatened. This area is warming at twice the global average rate, leading to unprecedented droughts, floods, heatwaves, and other extreme weather events in countries such as Algeria, Egypt, Morocco, Tunisia, and the UAE.

To address these challenges, it's crucial to transition from fossil fuels to renewables, which can provide energy independence for the region. Historic polluters must be held accountable, as they continue to refuse payments for loss and damage caused by their emissions.

At COP27, we need to establish a grant-based finance facility that supports adaptation, mitigation, and compensation. This will help communities recover and build a greener future.
