The car industry is guilty of greenwashing, pretending to care about the environment, health, and safety, all while contributing 9% of global greenhouse gas emissions in 2018—a figure that exceeds the EU's total emissions. It's time to phase out diesel, petrol, and hybrid cars, with an end to new sales by 2028, and shift to producing smaller, lighter, and efficient electric vehicles. Greenpeace is urging a rapid transition to public transport, renewables, cycling, walking, and micro-mobility in line with the Paris Agreement. We're planning protests at the Frankfurt Motor Show on September 14, along with an open letter targeting companies like Volkswagen and Hyundai-Kia for exploiting loopholes, cheating regulations, and prioritizing high-emission SUVs.
