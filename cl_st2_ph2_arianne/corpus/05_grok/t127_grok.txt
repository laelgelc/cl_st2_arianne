The Democratic Republic of Congo's government has auctioned off 27 oil blocks and three gas blocks, many of which overlap with sensitive ecosystems such as peatlands and Virunga National Park. Officials have presented this move as an act of nationalism, aimed at boosting the economy and putting people ahead of wildlife protection.

However, critics contend that such actions primarily enrich a small elite while deepening neo-colonial patterns. These patterns benefit foreign powers looking for alternatives to Russian fuel supplies. Local communities face significant harm, including displacement, pollution, and disruptions to their livelihoods, often without any prior consultation.

Instead, a genuine form of nationalism calls for reimagining development pathways. This could involve promoting local manufacturing, harnessing solar energy, prioritizing nature conservation, and developing eco-tourism. Such approaches would help create jobs, strengthen good governance, and ensure more equitable distribution of wealth.

Ultimately, this raises questions about whether the prevailing socio-economic model truly serves Africa's needs.
