Orpha Novita Yoshua, a young Indigenous Namblong woman from Grime Nawa Valley in West Papua, Indonesia, has written a powerful letter to UN Biodiversity Secretary Elizabeth Maruma Mrema during COP15. In her message, she highlights the critical importance of forests in Papua, Kalimantan, and Sumatra for safeguarding biodiversity, protecting the climate, and preserving Indigenous cultures. She warns that damage to these forests could lead to devastating crises, including species extinction and the loss of cultural heritage.

Orpha vividly describes the rich ecosystem of her home valley, which is home to animals such as cassowaries and birds of paradise, along with sago palms and sacred forests. As a symbolic gesture, she includes a Noken bag with her letter.

She strongly condemns the illegal clearing of land by the palm oil company PT Permata Nusa Mandiri, which has proceeded without the consent of local communities. Orpha calls for the revocation of the company's permit, pointing to the government's inaction in addressing the issue.
