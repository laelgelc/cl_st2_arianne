Imagine a world by 2032 where people and the planet come first, before profit and endless growth. This vision draws inspiration from Indigenous wisdom, such as the idea of weighing decisions based on their effects on seven generations ahead, and the Ubuntu philosophy that emphasizes our shared humanity and interconnectedness.

Recent crises have laid bare the vulnerabilities in our current systems. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted our deep dependence on caregivers, showing how essential their roles are in holding societies together.
