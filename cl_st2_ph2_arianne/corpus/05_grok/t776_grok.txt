I recently visited Amami Oshima, an island impacted by the oil spill from the Sanchi tanker in the East China Sea. As a Greenpeace Japan Communications Officer, I witnessed the devastating effects firsthand. Lumps of oil dotted the beaches, and I saw a fishing net completely soaked in oil. The spill has taken a heavy toll on wildlife: a dead streaked shearwater lay on the shore, and a sea turtle was choking on the toxic substance.

Clean-up efforts are underway, with teams collecting oily waste from the area. However, the toxicity persists, embedded in the sand and affecting marine life.

These oil spills are an inevitable consequence of our dependence on fossil fuels. To protect our oceans, we must reduce our use of petrochemicals, such as single-use plastics. Simple actions like walking or biking more can make a difference, and supporting renewable energy is crucial. This helps address broader threats to the oceans, including overfishing and pollution.
