Greenpeace activists have taken bold action by climbing the 14-storey EU Commission headquarters in Brussels to highlight Europe's role in global forest destruction. They unfurled a massive banner and spread ashes to symbolize the devastating Amazon fires and the struggles faced by indigenous communities.

The EU is a major importer of products linked to deforestation, taking in 36% of the globally traded items such as beef, palm oil, and soy. This consumption drives over 10% of worldwide forest loss.

Despite promises made by companies in 2010 to eliminate deforestation from their supply chains by 2020, they have failed to deliver.

It's time for real change. We need a strong EU law that bans the import of products linked to deforestation. Join us in participating in the Commission's public consultation to demand action against deforestation and human rights abuses.
