On July 23, 2010, Dorothy Stowe, co-founder of Greenpeace, passed away at the age of 89 in Vancouver. Born in 1920 in Rhode Island to Jewish immigrant parents, she studied English and philosophy before becoming a psychiatric social worker and leading a union during the McCarthy era. In 1953, she married Irving Stowe, and together they campaigned against nuclear weapons, inspired by Quaker principles. After immigrating to New Zealand and then to Canada, they helped form the Don't Make a Wave Committee in 1968. This effort culminated in the 1971 Greenpeace voyage, which pressured the United States to end its nuclear tests. The organization officially became Greenpeace in 1972 and has since grown into a global movement. Throughout her life, Dorothy inspired activists around the world, hosting notable figures such as Bono and Kumi Naidoo, and she exemplified a lifelong commitment to peace, justice, and ecology.
