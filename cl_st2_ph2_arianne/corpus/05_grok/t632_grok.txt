In the Usinsk region of Russia, seismic surveys and oil exploration are causing devastating impacts on the environment and local communities. Polluted waters, widespread deforestation, and the disappearance of fish and wildlife are rampant, while explosions from these activities shake houses and disrupt daily life.

Local residents have shared firsthand accounts of the damage, describing how road construction has turned once-clear brooks into muddy streams. Traditional berry-picking and hunting paths have been lost, cutting off access to vital resources. Health risks are a major concern due to oil spills, such as the 1994 disaster that contaminated the Pechora River.

Villagers are protesting the careless operations conducted by Lukoil-Komi, expressing deep fears of further environmental destruction. They stress that the land holds far greater value for their livelihoods than for oil extraction.
