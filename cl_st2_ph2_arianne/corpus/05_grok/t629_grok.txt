At just 16 years old, Isra Hirsi, a student from Minneapolis, is co-leading the US Youth Climate Strike. This movement draws inspiration from Greta Thunberg and has strikes planned for March 15 across 47 countries and nearly all 50 states in the US.

Isra has been involved in activism since first grade, but she began taking it more seriously in high school. She got involved through her school's green team and the MN Can’t Wait coalition. Her motivations stem from events like the Flint crisis and the Line 3 pipeline.

This youth-led movement is notably dominated by young women of color. It demands urgent climate action, including measures like the Green New Deal.

Participating in these strikes involves risking education to push for real change. Despite the stress it brings, young people are stepping up to organize, and adults need to confront the discomfort this creates.
