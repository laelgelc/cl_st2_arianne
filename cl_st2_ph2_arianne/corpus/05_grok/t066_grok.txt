Air pollution is a critical health threat worldwide, with 99% of the global population breathing air that exceeds safe levels according to World Health Organization guidelines. At Greenpeace India, we launched the "Power The Pedal" campaign to address this by providing bicycles to low-wage women in Delhi and Bengaluru, promoting empowerment and cleaner transportation options. As part of the campaign, we also delivered a petition accompanied by an art installation calling for revisions to air quality standards.

In Indonesia, Greenpeace supported a lawsuit that successfully upheld citizens' right to clean air in Jakarta. In Malaysia, we filed a human rights complaint, created murals and art installations, and displayed a banner demanding the adoption of a Clean Air Act. In Colombia, we installed a clean air capsule to draw attention to pollution levels in Bogotá.

These initiatives underscore how air quality is fundamentally an issue of equity, and they reflect Greenpeace's ongoing efforts around the world to combat air pollution.
