Gustav Martner, a former advertising industry professional who is now Greenpeace Nordic's Head of Creative, made a bold return to the Cannes Lions Festival. There, he returned awards that had been won for campaigns promoting airlines and car companies. By disrupting the ceremony, he called for an EU ban on fossil fuel advertising and sponsorship.

Martner criticizes the advertising industry for ignoring ongoing climate crises, including wars, droughts, and record heat, all while continuing to award polluters and enabling greenwashing.

He highlights his own shift in perspective, which came after viewing films like An Inconvenient Truth. Martner points out that even after the Paris Agreement, the industry has given awards to fossil fuel campaigns. He also references delay tactics exposed by the IPCC, such as BP's carbon footprint calculator, which shifts blame onto individuals.

An European Citizens' Initiative is currently seeking one million signatures to push for this ban.
