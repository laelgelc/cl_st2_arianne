Our oceans are under threat, and we need urgent action to protect them now. The UK has committed to designating 30% of its seas as marine protected areas by 2030 and has formed the Global Ocean Alliance to push for global protection. But we demand a strong Global Ocean Treaty that can enable effective ocean sanctuaries worldwide.

Norway is hosting the 'Our Ocean' conference in Oslo on 23-24 October, but this looks like mere PR without real solutions. We urge people to tweet and push leaders beyond empty promises.

Scientists stress that we must protect at least a third of the oceans by 2030 to aid marine recovery and combat climate breakdown, even as UN negotiations proceed slowly.
