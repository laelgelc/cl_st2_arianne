As a Greenpeace volunteer from Indonesia, I've seen firsthand the heartbreaking devastation of our rainforests being cleared for palm oil plantations. These actions are endangering precious species, exploiting local communities, and leading to catastrophic issues like the massive fires that ravaged the region in 2015.

That's why I joined fellow activists to board a ship owned by Wilmar, which was carrying dirty palm oil destined for Europe. Our protest highlights Wilmar's involvement in deforestation and human rights abuses.

Even brands like Oreo have promised to use clean palm oil, but they've failed to follow through on those commitments.

We must take action now to stop this destruction from continuing. I urge everyone to support us in pressuring Wilmar and its buyers to adopt truly sustainable practices.
