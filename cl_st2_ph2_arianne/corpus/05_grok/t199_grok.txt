Russia's invasion of Ukraine must be condemned. The risks to people are immense, with suffering in cities like Kyiv, Kharkiv, Kherson, and Mariupol. Over 1.5 million have fled, signaling a major humanitarian crisis.

Support can be provided through organizations including UNHCR for refugees, Africans Rising for stranded Africans, Stand with Ukraine for protests, War Help for fleeing people, Ukrainian Red Cross for aid, People in Need for supplies, OutRight Action for LGBTQIA+ groups, Kyiv Independent for reporting, Blood Agents for blood donations, and Unicef for children and families.
