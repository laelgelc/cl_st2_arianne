Europe has a massive responsibility when it comes to the climate crisis. The EU bloc is accountable for 22% of historic emissions, and it's time we demand more ambitious action to match that footprint.

The draft Climate Law falls short in key areas. Its 2030 target is too weak—we need at least a 65% reduction in emissions to stay on track for limiting warming to 1.5°C. The law also fails to phase out fossil fuel subsidies, doesn't address the 12-17% share of emissions from animal farming, and doesn't include a ban on new petrol and diesel cars by 2028.

Even the €1 trillion Sustainable Investment Plan isn't enough and could end up supporting fossil fuels.

That's why we need you to step up. Put pressure on your national leaders through marches and direct contacts. Push them to strengthen the Climate Law and the European Green Deal, tackling the root economic causes of the crisis. Together, we can make the EU lead on real climate solutions.
