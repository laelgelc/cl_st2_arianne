Every year on International Women’s Day, March 8, fossil fuel companies seize the opportunity to polish their public image through what can only be described as "gender-washing." They sponsor events, run promotions, tweet about women's careers or gender gaps in tech, and even back cultural activities—all in an effort to appear supportive of women and gender equality.

This tactic mirrors greenwashing, where these same companies pretend to be environmentally friendly while their actions tell a different story. In reality, their core business of extracting, transporting, processing, and burning fossil fuels leads to widespread pollution, spills, and climate breakdown.

These impacts disproportionately affect women, exacerbating environmental damage, extreme weather events, and increasing vulnerability to gender-based violence.

If fossil fuel companies truly care about women's rights, they should stop these harmful practices immediately.
