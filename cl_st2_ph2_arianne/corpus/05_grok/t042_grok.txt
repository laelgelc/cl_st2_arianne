In the heart of Manaus, Brazil, lies Parque das Tribos, an urban Indigenous neighborhood established in 2014. This community is home to 750 families representing more than 30 different ethnic groups, all grappling with challenges like poverty, racism, and inadequate infrastructure.

The COVID-19 pandemic intensified a hunger crisis here, but local residents have stepped up with vital initiatives. Renata Peixe-Boi leads the Boca da Mata communal kitchen, which serves fresh meals that hold cultural significance. This effort not only addresses immediate needs but also empowers migrant women and helps youth reconnect with their Indigenous languages and traditions.

Meanwhile, Claudia Baré is working on a planned school that will affirm Indigenous identities, fight against prejudice, and shield children from crime.

Through these community-driven actions, Parque das Tribos is fostering inclusion, justice, and a focus on collective well-being rather than profit, offering inspiration for alternative paths forward.
