From aboard the Greenpeace ship Esperanza, we're witnessing firsthand the devastating impact of human activities on our oceans, especially through destructive shark fishing. Campaigner Will McCallum reports that we've sailed through a fishing ground where up to 25,000 endangered sharks are killed each year, primarily for their fins. In this area, shark catches outnumber swordfish 4:1.

We documented a longliner vessel hauling in eight sharks and just one swordfish, which underscores the failures in current ocean management. Joining us on board is low-impact fisherman Jerry Percy, helping to highlight how these practices affect coastal communities.

Greenpeace is calling for a strong Global Ocean Treaty to limit shark catches and establish ocean sanctuaries that protect against industrial fishing and drilling, in line with recommendations from scientists.
