Biodiversity is under siege from human greed and exploitation, threatening the interconnected web of life that sustains us all. Commercial fisheries, for instance, are responsible for killing millions of sharks each year, pushing these vital species toward collapse.

The upcoming CBD COP15 in Kunming, China, represents a pivotal moment for establishing global protections to halt this destruction. Among the key proposals is a global biodiversity fund that would start at $100 billion annually and increase to $700 billion. China has also committed to the Kunming Fund, providing $230 million to support these efforts.

It's essential to avoid false solutions such as offsets, which fail to address the root causes. Instead, protections must prioritize Indigenous rights, especially in ambitious targets like 30x30, which aims to conserve 30% of the planet by 2030.

Greenpeace's ocean blueprint offers a roadmap for creating sanctuaries to safeguard marine life. Consider the stark realities: only 9% of forests remain intact, the Amazon is facing severe degradation, and a mere 3% of oceans are free from human pressures.

Yet, there are successes to build on, such as Indigenous-led protections in Brazil and West Papua, demonstrating the power of community-driven conservation.
