The abandoned FSO Safer oil tanker, moored off Yemen's Red Sea coast, poses dire risks to the region. This decaying vessel holds over 1.1 million barrels of crude oil, which could lead to devastating spills or explosions. Such disasters would severely impact human life, wildlife, fisheries, and ecosystems.

Fishing communities in the area would face particularly severe effects, with livelihoods threatened by contaminated waters and disrupted marine resources. Cleanup efforts following a spill would generate massive amounts of hazardous waste, complicating recovery and posing long-term environmental challenges.

The oil itself carries significant health dangers due to its toxic and carcinogenic properties. Exposure could affect organs, skin, and lungs, leading to serious health issues for those in proximity.

To mitigate risks, individuals should use protective equipment when necessary, coordinate with authorities for any response activities, avoid contaminated areas, and refrain from burning waste or attempting informal cleanups.

Greenpeace welcomes the recent agreement to transfer the oil from the FSO Safer but urges the immediate deployment of containment booms and standby response equipment to prevent catastrophe. This situation underscores the failures of the oil industry, and we call for its end to avert future threats like this.
