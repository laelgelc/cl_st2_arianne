Penguins have been spotted in unexpected places around the world, from trains and airports to famous landmarks in cities like Sydney, Buenos Aires, London, and Johannesburg. This is part of a new Greenpeace campaign highlighting the urgent need for protection in the Antarctic.

The campaign is pushing for the creation of a 1.8 million square kilometer Antarctic Ocean Sanctuary. This sanctuary would safeguard penguins, whales, and seals by banning industrial krill fishing, helping to curb the effects of climate change, and supporting overall ocean health.

In October, the Antarctic Ocean Commission will meet to discuss this proposal, offering a crucial chance to make it a reality. We need world leaders to step up and act now. Join the movement and add your voice at protecttheantarctic.org.
