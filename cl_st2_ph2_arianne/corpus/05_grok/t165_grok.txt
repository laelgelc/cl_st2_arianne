In a powerful display of global solidarity, Greenpeace volunteers from 16 countries joined forces with Brazilian Indigenous leaders in Amsterdam to block a massive ship loaded with 60 million kilos of soy from Brazil. Their bold action was a direct call for the European Union to enact a strong anti-deforestation law that truly protects forests, ecosystems, and Indigenous rights.

The current draft of this law falls short with significant gaps, including the exclusion of vital areas like the Cerrado and insufficient protections for human rights. Meanwhile, corporate interests are pushing back against essential transparency measures.

The EU's heavy reliance on soy imports—primarily used for animal feed—is fueling rampant deforestation and putting Indigenous communities at risk. To address this crisis, we must drastically cut meat and dairy consumption by 70% by 2030, a move that would benefit human health, preserve nature, and combat climate change.

This urgency is echoed by over a million Europeans who have already voiced their demand for decisive action.
