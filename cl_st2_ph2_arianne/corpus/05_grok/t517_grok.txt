Kate Nelson has been living plastic-free for 11 years, a journey that began after she witnessed the devastating ocean plastic pollution in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. Motivated by this experience, she made a commitment to eliminate single-use plastics from her life.

To achieve this, Kate ditched items like straws, bags, bottles, and cups, replacing them with reusables. She started using cloth bags for shopping, glass jars for storing goods, and refillable vessels for drinks and other needs.

Adopting this plastic-free lifestyle brought unexpected benefits. It sparked creativity in her daily routines, encouraged healthier eating habits, and helped her build stronger connections within her community.

Now, Kate is championing Global Refill Day on November 6 as a way to spread the message. She encourages everyone to join by bringing their own reusables to stores, asking for them to be filled directly, and sharing photos of their efforts using #ReuseRevolution and #BreakFreeFromPlastic. Through these actions, the goal is to normalize reuse, inspire more people to participate, and pressure companies to adopt refillable solutions that drive broader systemic change.
