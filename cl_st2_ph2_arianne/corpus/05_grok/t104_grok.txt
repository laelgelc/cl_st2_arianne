As the world gathers for COP27, the 27th UN Climate Summit in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, from November 6-18, 2022, the emphasis is on advancing climate justice and limiting warming to 1.5°C. This critical meeting aims to address the urgent needs of our planet through several key priorities.

One major focus is establishing a loss and damage finance facility, funded by polluting nations, to support those hardest hit by climate impacts. Another priority is the rapid phasing out of fossil fuels, ensuring no new projects and implementing just transitions for affected communities and workers.

The summit also seeks to provide $100 billion annually to low-income countries for adaptation and decarbonization efforts, helping them build resilience and shift to sustainable energy. Additionally, integrating nature protection with Indigenous involvement is essential to safeguard ecosystems and respect traditional knowledge.

Amid growing activism, the global climate movement must push governments for urgent action. Recent IPCC reports highlight escalating crises, underscoring the need for immediate and bold steps at COP27 to secure a livable future for all.
