As we face the escalating crisis of biodiversity loss, it's clear that protecting the rich web of life on our planet is essential for maintaining a habitable world. Alarming declines are underway, with forecasts indicating a two-thirds drop in animal species by 2020 compared to 1970 levels.

At the Cancun CBD summit, governments must acknowledge their failures and step up with bold commitments to safeguard vital areas such as the Great Northern Forest and the Arctic Ocean. Back in 2010, pledges were made to protect 10% of oceans and ensure sustainable forest management by 2020, yet these goals remain unmet. Today, only 3% of oceans are protected, leaving vast marine ecosystems vulnerable.

Forests are equally at risk, including the immense Great Northern Forest, which supports communities and countless species while serving as the planet's largest carbon store. Threats from logging, fires, and climate change are putting this critical area in jeopardy.

It's time for all of us to take action and push for the fair sharing of resources to secure a sustainable future.
