Thousands of people around the world have joined Greenpeace's call for Samsung to reuse or recycle the 4.3 million Galaxy Note7 phones. Cyberactivists launched a 24-hour tweetstorm using the hashtag #SaveTheGalaxy, which helped make #GalaxyNote7 trend in Mexico.

Supporters from countries including Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Mexico, the US, UK, Germany, Netherlands, Australia, and Colombia have been calling Samsung. They received mixed responses about the company's disposal plans, ranging from destruction to recycling or no information at all.

Greenpeace Korea held a protest at Samsung's headquarters, urging CEO Kwon Oh-hyun to rethink product design and reuse materials.
