European cities are taking significant steps to tackle air pollution and emissions by prioritizing public transport, cycling, and walking instead of cars. In Oslo, efforts are focused on boosting cycling infrastructure through the creation of car-free zones and the conversion of car parks into bike lanes. Amsterdam stands out with more bikes than people, having redesigned its streets following protests in the 1970s against traffic fatalities, though the city still exceeds EU air pollution limits. Copenhagen is a leader in this area, featuring popular bike lanes and strong encouragement for walking, even as its public transport ranks in the mid-range. Vienna provides affordable public transport options to residents, while Zurich sees high usage of public transport but requires improvements in safety for cyclists and pedestrians. According to a Greenpeace report that ranks 13 cities, these examples highlight both leaders and laggards in sustainable urban mobility, with poorer performers at risk of facing EU legal action.
