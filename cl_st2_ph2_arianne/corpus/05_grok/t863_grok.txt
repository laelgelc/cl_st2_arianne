Black Friday and Cyber Monday drive billions in sales, but they also generate massive waste that harms the environment through overconsumption, especially in fast fashion. At Greenpeace, we advocate for reducing consumption through initiatives like "Buy Nothing Day" and call for a "Time out for Fast Fashion." We urge people to wear, repair, swap, and reuse clothes longer. Fashion brands should design for quality and longevity.

Production in the fashion industry pollutes water with toxins, and clothing lifecycles have shortened, leading to overload in second-hand markets and unviable recycling. Ultimately, most garments become waste, burned or landfilled.
