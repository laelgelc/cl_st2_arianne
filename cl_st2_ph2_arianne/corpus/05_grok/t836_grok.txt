The Canadian government's approach to addressing the decline of caribou populations is outdated and ineffective, failing to protect these vital species and their habitats. In Quebec, the decision to relocate the Val-d’Or herd to a zoo represents an abdication of responsibilities outlined in recovery plans and the Species at Risk Act (SARA), sidestepping the need for genuine conservation efforts.

Meanwhile, in British Columbia, efforts like wolf culling merely address symptoms of the problem, ignoring the root cause of habitat destruction driven by poor forest management practices. Even though SARA strategies exist and numerous studies have highlighted the risks facing caribou, governments have taken little meaningful action to reverse the declines.

It's time to apply science and Indigenous knowledge immediately to these challenges. We need stronger habitat protections developed with input from First Nations, ensuring that recovery strategies are fully implemented. The public can play a crucial role by supporting petitions that demand these changes and help safeguard Canada's boreal forests for caribou and future generations.
