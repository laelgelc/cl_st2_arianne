Captain Mike Fincken has spent three decades as a sailor, considering the oceans his home. Over the years, he has seen their decline firsthand, driven by overfishing, poor management, and illegal activities in West Africa. He is urging for urgent regional fisheries management to foster sustainability and put an end to exploitation.

Currently aboard the Greenpeace ship Esperanza, Captain Mike and his crew are navigating West African waters for two and a half months. Their mission is to document the effects of overfishing on fish stocks, food security, and local communities.

Reflecting on his past experiences, Captain Mike recounts chasing pirate vessels, witnessing infractions by Chinese fleets, assisting in arrests, and observing destructive European "Monster boats."
