Fossil fuel companies are infiltrating cultural spaces such as sports, music festivals, arts, and museums through their advertisements and sponsorships. This presence pollutes these areas, misleading consumers and hindering climate action, even as scientific warnings about the climate crisis continue to mount.

As European activists, we have unique access to the oil giants headquartered here, which comes with a responsibility to challenge them directly. We must amplify the voices of vulnerable frontline communities and combat the greenwashing tactics these companies use to obscure their harmful impacts.

Grassroots groups are pushing for a #BanFossilAds to address this issue. Activists like Mattina, Noëlie, Teresa, and Talissa are speaking out, pointing to how these sponsorships distract from the pollution, lobbying, and exploitation caused by fossil fuel companies. They emphasize the need for radical change to safeguard people and the planet.
