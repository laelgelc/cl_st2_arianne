Greenpeace Switzerland activists took bold action by projecting powerful messages onto Nestlé’s headquarters in Vevey, just ahead of the company's Annual General Meeting. The projections accused Nestlé of fueling both the plastic and climate crises through its heavy reliance on single-use packaging.

The activists demanded that Nestlé take real steps to reduce throwaway plastics and invest in reusable systems. They criticized the company's focus on recycling and alternative materials as mere greenwashing that ultimately harms biodiversity.

In 2020 alone, Nestlé sold 1.3 million tonnes of single-use plastic, with less than 1% of it being reusable. The company has been named one of the top global polluters.

The projections also spotlighted the petroleum origins of plastic and called for a fundamental shift from single-use to reuse models to fight pollution and global warming.
