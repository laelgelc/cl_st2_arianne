Actors Alexander Skarsgard, known for his role in True Blood, and Jack McBrayer, from 30 Rock, have teamed up with Funny or Die and Greenpeace for a three-part mini-series called "Jack & Alex Set Sail." The series was filmed on a Greenpeace icebreaker in the Arctic Ocean off Greenland.

This collaboration aims to raise awareness about global warming and support the "Save the Arctic" campaign, which seeks to prevent fossil fuel drilling in the region.

Skarsgard expressed his hope that viewers will appreciate the Arctic's beauty and recognize the importance of preserving it from becoming an oil field.

McBrayer shared that witnessing rolling icebergs, calving glaciers, and whales during the filming was phenomenal and inspiring.
