Imagine standing in what was once a thriving part of the Great Northern Forest, now a recently clearcut logging site. Ancient trees that stood for centuries have been reduced to a barren wasteland, with habitats for insects, birds, mushrooms, and lichen destroyed in the process.

Forest campaigner Lina Burnelius from Greenpeace Nordic points the finger at Essity, the producer of Tempo and the world's second-largest tissue company. Essity sources pulp from suppliers that are expanding into critical biodiversity-rich forests in Sweden, Finland, and Russia.

It's time for Essity to protect these areas by committing to sustainable forestry outside critical landscapes and using recycled materials. We call on you, our readers, to demand a cleaner supply chain from Essity.
