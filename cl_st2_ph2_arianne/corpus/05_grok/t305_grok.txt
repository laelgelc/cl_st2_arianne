My journey began as an aerospace engineering student, but it took a profound turn toward becoming an ecologist. Key influences reshaped my path, starting with Rachel Carson's Silent Spring, which exposed the dangers of pesticides. The 1969 Cuyahoga River fire brought pollution into stark relief, showing the urgent environmental crises we faced. Gregory Bateson's lectures on interconnected patterns in nature, emphasizing that "all divisions are arbitrary," deepened my understanding of how everything links together. Indigenous teachings, such as "Mitakuye-Oyasin" meaning "all my relations," shared by elders like Fools Crow, reinforced this sense of connection. Even a childhood encounter with a magpie sparked a kinship with the wild that stayed with me.

These experiences molded my perspectives on ecology, complex systems, unintended consequences, and the vital need to protect the relational webs in nature. They propelled me into journalism, led to my exile to Canada, and ultimately to founding Greenpeace, where we took actions like protecting whales.
