When we talk about protecting the oceans, it's easy to focus on the incredible marine life that calls them home. But ocean protection is about so much more—it's fundamentally about safeguarding people too. Over 3 billion individuals worldwide depend on the oceans for their livelihoods, food sources, and deep cultural connections, with communities in the Global South feeling this reliance most acutely.

Destructive industries, such as industrial fishing, are causing widespread harm. These practices deplete vital fish stocks, leaving coastal communities in devastation. Take, for example, a fisherman in Nigeria who now struggles to afford schooling for his children and cover basic living costs due to these impacts. Beyond that, migrant workers in these industries often endure exploitation, including violence and grueling long shifts.

The oceans play a crucial role in fighting climate change by absorbing 20-30% of emissions. Yet, ongoing exploitation puts this essential function at risk.

That's why we need urgent action. By signing our petition, you can help push for a strong Global Ocean Treaty that protects the high seas and the people who depend on them.
