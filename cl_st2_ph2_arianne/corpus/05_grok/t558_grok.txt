Greenpeace's Pole to Pole voyage took us on an incredible journey across the world's oceans, where we documented breathtaking wonders alongside urgent threats from climate change, overfishing, plastic pollution, and deep-sea mining. Throughout this expedition, we advocated strongly for a UN Global Ocean Treaty that would establish sanctuaries to protect these vital ecosystems.

Our travels began in the Antarctic, where we witnessed the impacts on penguin populations, with declines linked to scarcity of krill, a key food source affected by environmental pressures. Moving to the Amazon Reef, our team confirmed the presence of whale breeding grounds, highlighting the area's importance for marine life. In the Sargasso Sea, we observed wildlife entangled in plastic debris, underscoring the pervasive pollution crisis. Finally, at the Lost City hydrothermal vents, we explored unique underwater formations now at risk from potential deep-sea mining activities.

As part of our efforts, we produced the film "Turtle Journey" to raise awareness about ocean conservation. We also directly confronted fishing vessels operating in sensitive areas, and our researchers gathered data on turtles and sharks to support protection initiatives.

Despite these discoveries and actions, UN negotiations on ocean protection have been disappointing so far. That's why we're urging leaders and communities worldwide to push for stronger global action to safeguard our oceans for future generations.
