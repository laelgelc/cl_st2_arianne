In 2020, as we all adapted to COVID-19 security measures and the privileges of remote work, it's crucial to recognize the essential role played by public transport workers. These dedicated individuals ensured that frontline workers without access to cars could reach their destinations, keeping vital services operational.

Too often, public transport is overlooked in a society that emphasizes individual modes like cars and flying as symbols of freedom. Yet, mobility is fundamental for community care, sustenance, and tackling inequality.

The pandemic has highlighted the urgent need to invest in strong public services and to show gratitude to those who provide them. Let's take a moment to appreciate and thank the public transport staff—drivers, ticket sellers, technicians, operators, cleaners, maintenance crews, and office workers—for keeping our communities running, especially during the holidays.
