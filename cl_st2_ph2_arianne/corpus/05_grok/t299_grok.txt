The X-Press-Pearl ship disaster off the coast of Sri Lanka unleashed a wave of environmental devastation. Charred debris, hazardous cargo, and billions of plastic nurdles washed up on the beaches, contaminating the shores and waters. This led to a fishing ban across an 80km radius, which has devastated the livelihoods of local fishermen. Their struggles were already intensified by pandemic lockdowns, and the situation was further compounded by heavy rains and flooding.

Photographer and activist Tashiya has been on the ground documenting the crisis. Her work highlights the chemical contamination spreading through the area, the dead marine life washing ashore, and the long-term damage to ecosystems.

Through her documentation, Tashiya urges action: stopping plastic production, shifting to a sustainable economy, holding corporations accountable, and addressing broader capitalist and climate risks to prevent such disasters in the future.
