At COP25, a groundbreaking moment is unfolding: the first intercontinental meeting of Climate Strikers from the global north and south. Representatives from each continent are coming together to amplify youth voices in climate policy decisions.

In the past, conferences like this have excluded young people, leaving their perspectives sidelined. But this time, things will be different. The strikers are taking the initiative with actions such as a press conference on Wednesday and a massive climate march in Madrid on Friday, which will feature Greta Thunberg.

Even as strikes continue around the world, governments have largely ignored the calls for change. This inaction is fueling ongoing youth efforts to push for system change, radical measures to limit global warming to 1.5°C, and solidarity in the fight for climate justice.
