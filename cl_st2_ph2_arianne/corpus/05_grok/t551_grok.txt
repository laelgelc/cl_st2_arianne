The car industry is pushing out increasingly heavier vehicles, such as SUVs, that consume more energy and emit higher levels of CO2. This problem persists even in electric models, which require larger batteries to power their added weight.

Take the VW Golf as an example: over the decades, its weight has increased significantly, resulting in 57% more emissions. The Tiguan, another model from the same manufacturer, is even heavier, exacerbating the issue.

Beyond emissions, these SUVs create greater risks in accidents for pedestrians and other road users. Drivers of these vehicles are also more likely to engage in risky behavior behind the wheel.

Instead of aligning with the goals of the Paris Agreement, the industry is prioritizing profits. They're pouring resources into heavy advertising and investments in SUVs, capitalizing on booming sales figures.

We need a shift toward smaller electric cars, along with more shared ownership models, expanded public transport options, and an overall reduction in the number of vehicles on the road.

Greenpeace recently staged a protest against the import of SUVs to draw attention to these concerns and push for change.
