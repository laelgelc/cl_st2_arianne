Emma Mederic, a 23-year-old Seychellois conservationist and Assistant Aldabra Science Coordinator with the Seychelles Islands Foundation (SIF), is dedicated to protecting Aldabra Atoll. This UNESCO marine World Heritage Site serves as a natural laboratory teeming with diverse species, including giant tortoises, green turtles, and dugongs. SIF has managed the atoll since 1979, with its research station established in 1971. The work there promotes evidence-based conservation and gender diversity, featuring all-female teams.

Emma shares her experiences amid challenges like climate change, pollution, and unsustainable fisheries. She urges everyone to reduce their ecological footprints, end the use of fossil fuels, and support a Global Ocean Treaty to safeguard Aldabra and the biodiversity of the high seas.
