In 1971, a group of activists set out on a bold mission, funded by a rock concert that featured Joni Mitchell and James Taylor. They sailed the boat named "Greenpeace" toward Amchitka Island to protest a US nuclear test. The voyage encountered internal conflicts and ego clashes among the crew, and it was ultimately intercepted by the US Navy, preventing them from reaching the site.

Even though the boat didn't make it to Amchitka, the effort generated massive media attention. This spotlight contributed to the cancellation of further nuclear tests there and the eventual designation of Amchitka as a bird sanctuary.

Bob Hunter, reflecting on the events, recalls his initial despair at what seemed like a failure. However, he came to see it as the successful beginning of Greenpeace, which has grown into a global organization with millions of members.
