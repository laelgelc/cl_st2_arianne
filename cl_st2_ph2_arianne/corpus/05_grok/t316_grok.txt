Deep sea mining is emerging as a destructive industry that poses severe threats to deep ocean ecosystems. Despite existing scientific evidence showing long-lasting damage from such activities, the push for mining continues unchecked.

The precautionary principle demands that we halt deep sea mining to prevent irreversible harm. Unfortunately, the International Seabed Authority (ISA) is failing in its duty by prioritizing economic interests over environmental protection.

Companies like DeepGreen and GSR are engaging in greenwashing tactics, using "minesplaining" to downplay risks and making false claims about the climate benefits of deep sea mining.

We must reject the false choice presented between mining the ocean or continuing destructive land-based mining. Instead, the focus should be on promoting resource efficiency and building a circular economy to meet our needs sustainably.

It's crucial to support a Global Ocean Treaty that would protect our oceans from exploitation and ensure their preservation for future generations.
