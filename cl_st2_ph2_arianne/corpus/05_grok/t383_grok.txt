In 2020, the MV Wakashio oil spill in Mauritius resulted in 1,000 tonnes of fuel leaking into a lagoon near a marine reserve. This incident harmed local communities and marine life.

Disasters like this highlight the urgent need to ban dangerous fuels in fragile areas, such as the Arctic, and to transition shipping away from fossil fuels.

However, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) has backtracked on its 2018 commitments to cut emissions in line with the Paris Agreement. This move ignores the climate emergency, even though shipping emits 1 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent annually—more than twice the UK's emissions.

That's why we need a strong Global Ocean Treaty in 2021 to improve governance and accountability, and to prioritize conservation over exploitation.
