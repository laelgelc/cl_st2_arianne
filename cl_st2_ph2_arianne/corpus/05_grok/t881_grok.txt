Around the world, governments and communities are taking bold steps to curb plastic pollution and protect our environment. In France, thin single-use plastic bags have been banned as part of a broader European Union effort to reduce waste. Morocco has gone even further with a comprehensive ban on the production, import, sale, and distribution of plastic bags, though it has encountered resistance from stockpiling.

In India, the state of Karnataka has outlawed a range of plastics, including bags, plates, and microbeads, leading to the seizure of 39,000kg of illegal plastic. Over in the United States, San Francisco has been a pioneer: it banned plastic bags in 2007, followed by water bottles in 2014, and styrofoam, which is notoriously difficult to recycle.

Other notable actions include Honolulu's 2015 ban on plastic bags, Tasmania's 2003 initiative that cut bag usage by 350,000, and Ethiopia's 2011 ban linked to promoting green energy. These efforts are crucial because plastic pollution in our oceans is devastating marine life, choking wildlife and disrupting ecosystems.

At Greenpeace, we're calling on everyone to join the Plastics Pledge and help build on this momentum for a cleaner planet.
