On International Women’s Day, fossil fuel companies often roll out PR campaigns touting their efforts toward gender diversity. Yet, these same companies are driving the climate crisis, which worsens inequalities and violence against women and gender minorities. Women and gender minorities bear higher risks during climate disasters, receive limited access to relief, and experience increased sexual and physical violence. This is particularly evident in "man camps" set up near fossil fuel extraction sites, such as during North Dakota's Bakken oil boom.

The fossil fuel industry itself is patriarchal, with low female employment rates and significant gender pay gaps, further fueling inequality. To address this, a shift to renewables is essential. This means banning new fossil fuel projects and phasing out existing ones to achieve climate justice.
