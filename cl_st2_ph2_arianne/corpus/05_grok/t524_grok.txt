Norway has long projected an image of being a nature-loving nation, but when it comes to protecting our oceans, its actions tell a different story. Despite this reputation, Norway has opposed a strong Global Ocean Treaty, standing in the way of vital protections for marine environments.

In 2016, Norway blocked efforts to establish protected areas in the Central Arctic Ocean. More recently, last year, it joined forces with Russia and China to block similar protections in the Antarctic.

The country's priorities are clear: it spends more on oil exploration—€6.9 million—than on ocean protection. Norway is also pushing ahead with plans for Arctic drilling.

Prime Minister Erna Solberg has dismissed the importance of ocean protection, claiming it doesn't create jobs, even as she ignores scientific warnings about the threats facing our seas.

Currently, less than 1% of Norway's coastal areas are protected, which falls far short of the 10% protection promised by 2020. Furthermore, Norway resists ambitious targets, such as establishing 30% global ocean sanctuaries.
