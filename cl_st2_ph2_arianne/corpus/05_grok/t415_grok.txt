As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to unfold, we've seen an alarming rise in discarded disposable face masks washing up on coasts and beaches around the world, including right here in Taiwan. These single-use items, essential for public health, are now contributing to a growing environmental crisis.

From February to May alone, Taiwan consumed an estimated 1.3 billion masks, resulting in about 5,500 tonnes of waste. While masks used in medical settings are handled through proper waste management protocols, those worn by the general public often end up in a regulatory grey area. Due to potential contamination risks, these masks cannot be recycled, leading to improper disposal and littering.

The consequences are severe: masks made from materials like polypropylene break down over time, releasing microplastics that threaten ecosystems and marine life. Animals can become entangled in the straps or ingest the debris, disrupting fragile ocean habitats.

In response, the Taiwanese government has stepped up efforts with public education campaigns and fines for littering to curb the problem. At Greenpeace Taiwan, we're urging the development of comprehensive guidelines for single-use personal protective equipment (PPE) that prioritize both human health and environmental sustainability. This builds on our longstanding advocacy to reduce plastic pollution overall, ensuring that our fight against the pandemic doesn't come at the expense of the planet.
