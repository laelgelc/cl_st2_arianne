In the Vital Ocean Voices series, we share stories from coastal communities across the Indian Ocean, highlighting the impacts of destructive fishing, pollution, and climate breakdown. One such story comes from Anse Royale in Seychelles, where the Watershed Committee, including Terence Vel and Monica Samson, is working to restore mangrove wetlands.

The effort began with a 2016 program that includes establishing nurseries, organizing community planting events, and holding workshops. This Ecosystem-Based Adaptation initiative helps combat flooding, supports biodiversity, filters pollution, and aids fishing livelihoods.

Through community engagement, the project has fostered a sense of ownership among locals. As a result, the number of mangrove species in the area has increased from three to six, even in the face of past destruction caused by settlement and development.
