In the coastal district of Chana in southern Thailand, 18-year-old Khairiyah Rahmanyah, the daughter of a fisherman, is at the forefront of protests against a proposed industrial zone. This development would transform 26.8 square kilometers of seaside land into facilities for heavy industries, posing a serious threat to local marine resources and the communities that depend on them.

Khairiyah's involvement stems from her father's activism with the Thai Sea Watch Association, which has shaped her commitment to the cause. Despite facing police intimidation, arrests, and surveillance, she continues to lead the charge. She leverages social media platforms like Facebook Live to spread awareness and amplify the Save Chana movement.

Drawing inspiration from climate activist Greta Thunberg, Khairiyah remains dedicated to advocating for environmental protection. Through persistent actions, the movement has succeeded in delaying public hearings on the project. Looking ahead, Khairiyah aspires to study psychology, with the goal of using her education to benefit her hometown.
