The collapse of nature is accelerating due to rampant deforestation, threatening biodiversity worldwide. As world leaders gather at COP15, it's crucial to protect biodiversity by recognizing the rights of Indigenous Peoples. This means creating a new conservation category for their lands, where Indigenous Peoples lead decision-making and funding.

"Fortress conservation" models that exclude communities have led to severe abuses, including violence in places like Tanzania and Central Africa. These approaches are equated to colonialism, displacing people and failing to safeguard ecosystems effectively.

In contrast, Indigenous management has proven to yield better ecosystem protection, as supported by data. Despite this, Indigenous communities continue to face displacement by industries.

While there is some progress in areas like the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), more investment is needed. At the Montreal summit, it's time to reject exclusionary models and embrace just conservation that empowers Indigenous leadership.
