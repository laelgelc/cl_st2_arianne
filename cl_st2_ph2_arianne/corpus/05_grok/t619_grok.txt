Our Rainbow Warrior expedition in the Philippines' Verde Islands has uncovered a stark reality: plastic pollution is infiltrating even the smallest marine life, threatening ecosystems far from urban centers.

Nestlé's role in this crisis is undeniable. The company uses 1.7 million tonnes of plastic each year, marking a 5% increase over the past five years. An overwhelming 98% of this plastic is in single-use packaging, positioning Nestlé as the third-biggest plastic polluter globally.

It's time for Nestlé to step up and address the "plastic monster" it has helped create. We urge the company to phase out single-use plastics, invest in refill and reuse systems, and take full responsibility for the pollution it generates.

This call to action is part of our #BreakFreeFromPlastic movement. Activists have already delivered a plastic monster to Unilever in Rotterdam, and now we're sailing the Rhine River on the Beluga to confront Nestlé directly. While Nestlé has acknowledged that recycling alone isn't enough, it has yet to show the urgent action needed to make a real difference.
