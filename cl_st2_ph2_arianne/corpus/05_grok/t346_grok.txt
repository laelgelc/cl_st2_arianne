The climate crisis is deepening inequality and racial injustice, hitting racialized communities the hardest. Extreme weather events, forced migration, and discrimination are making these impacts even worse for them.

We need to center these communities in our solutions, including Indigenous Peoples who are protecting forests. This means standing up against polluting industries like fossil fuels.

This exploitation is linked to the history of slavery and ongoing colonialism. Extractive industries are disproportionately harming people of color by polluting their air, water, and soil. This leads to serious health issues and even death.

The communities least responsible for causing climate change are facing the worst of it, including floods, droughts, and displacement.

It's time for a just transition and to join the #FossilFreeRevolution.
