While media coverage of plastic pollution often spotlights its devastating effects on marine life, such as turtles and whales entangled in debris or ingesting waste, the severe impacts on humans are frequently overlooked. Plastic, derived from fossil fuels, continues to proliferate due to industry lobbying that maintains the production of single-use items. These same industries push recycling as a fix, but it's a false promise—only stopping production at the source can truly resolve the crisis.

Research conducted by Greenpeace East Asia and the Global Alliance for Incinerator Alternatives (GAIA) shows that following China's 2018 ban on imported waste, plastic waste has inundated Southeast Asia. This has led to towering piles of waste in communities, contaminated crops, and harmful emissions from open burning, all disproportionately affecting vulnerable populations.

Meanwhile, in countries that export this waste, it piles up in low-income neighborhoods, creating significant health hazards. Corporations like Nestlé and Unilever continue to benefit from this unsustainable system.
