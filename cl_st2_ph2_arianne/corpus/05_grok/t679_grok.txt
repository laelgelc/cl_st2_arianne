In a powerful open letter addressed to Chancellor Merkel, advocates are calling for an immediate moratorium on tree felling in Hambach Forest. This pause is urged until the Coal Commission can propose a just coal phase-out that aligns with the Paris Agreement, with assurances that energy company RWE and the state of North Rhine-Westphalia will respect the outcome.

The letter emphasizes the need to legally enshrine a coal phase-out by 2030, to be implemented in 2019, as a critical step to meet Germany's 2020 climate targets. It draws attention to the escalating conflicts in the area, where peaceful protests have highlighted the ongoing destruction of the ancient forest, all while the country remains heavily reliant on coal. This situation is damaging Germany's international reputation on climate action.

Adding to the urgency, the letter points to growing investor support for phasing out coal in OECD countries by 2030, alongside the impacts of recent extreme weather events. It also underscores Germany's failures in reducing emissions, presenting an opportunity for the nation to take a leading role in achieving a socially just transition away from coal.
