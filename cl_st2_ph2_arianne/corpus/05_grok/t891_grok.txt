Peter Willcox has served as a Greenpeace captain for over 30 years, sharing stories of confronting polluters, enduring arrests, and facing severe dangers, such as the French bombing of the Rainbow Warrior that resulted in the death of a crewmate. He draws a powerful analogy, comparing Earth to a boat carrying 7 billion people, where we're actively drilling holes that lead to rising waters, and the urgent need is to send an S.O.S. that stands for "Save Our Selves."

Driven by concern for his daughters' future, Willcox emphasizes Greenpeace's ongoing battle against the human suffering caused by environmental destruction. This includes the evacuation of Rongelap due to nuclear fallout and the threats from rising seas, slavery in the Amazon linked to deforestation, stowaways from Liberia, and families in the Philippines poisoned by waste from US military activities, as seen in the case of a dying girl named Crizel.
