I recently had the incredible opportunity to join Greenpeace's Rainbow Warrior in Venice for a powerful protest called the "Last Tour of Venice." This action aimed to spotlight the severe climate risks facing the city, including the threat of submersion due to the impacts of fossil fuels.

During this experience, I couldn't help but call out the oil and gas companies for their greenwashing tactics. They use sponsorships in museums, universities, and sports to keep their social license intact, masking their true environmental harm.

We've seen real progress in pushing back, with successes like Harvard's decision to divest from fossil fuels and various institutions ending deals with companies such as BP and Santos. It's time to go further by banning fossil fuel advertising, just as was done with tobacco.

This call aligns with a European citizens' initiative on the matter, and it's backed by the IPCC's revelations about the industry's disinformation campaigns. Additionally, 450 scientists have urged public relations agencies to stop working with these companies.
