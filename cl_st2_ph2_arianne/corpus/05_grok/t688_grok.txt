The destructive impact of greedy palm oil companies on Indonesian forests is devastating, with burning rainforests leading to species loss and community displacement. This threat is now expanding into Papua, where spectacular Birds of Paradise—around 40 species renowned for their beauty and behaviors—are increasingly at risk.

Street artists and volunteers around the world are responding by creating urban murals that depict these birds' plumage, dances, and traits. These artworks aim to raise awareness about the threats to Indonesian wildlife and inspire action.

We urge artists, students, bird enthusiasts, and consumers to join the #WingsOfParadise movement. Admire the artworks, share them, and discuss ways to protect the forests.
