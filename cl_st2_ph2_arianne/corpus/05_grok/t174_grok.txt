As a multimedia editor, I often find myself reflecting on what keeps me driven to fight for our planet, even amid the frustration of seeing the ongoing damage humans inflict on Earth. Every day, I view images that capture the stunning beauty of nature, and they serve as a powerful reminder that our home is truly worth protecting. For Earth Day, I've selected images showcasing Mother Earth's incredible creations from some of the planet's most remote regions, highlighting that nature itself is the greatest force we must preserve and care for. I'd love to hear from you in the comments: what motivates you to keep persevering in this fight?
