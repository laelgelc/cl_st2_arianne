Over the past 50 years, Greenpeace has built a rich history of collaborating with musicians to amplify our environmental campaigns. It all began in 1970 with a benefit concert featuring Joni Mitchell and James Taylor, which helped fund our first expedition to protest nuclear tests.

In the 1980s, this musical partnership continued with notable albums, including the 1989 Soviet release "Greenpeace: Breakthrough," featuring artists like U2 and Sting. The 1990s saw us organizing anti-nuclear concerts to rally support against ongoing threats.

More recently, we've seen powerful modern efforts, such as Ludovico Einaudi's 2016 performance in the Arctic, Thom Yorke's 2018 track dedicated to ocean protection, and the 2017 Save Our Sounds project, which involved remixing nature recordings into the "Soundtrack to the Future" album.

Through these collaborations, music has inspired global action for environmental justice.
