Environmental justice cannot be separated from social justice. As ocean advocates, we must confront the root causes of environmental harm, including racism, patriarchy, and deep-seated inequalities, to build a new normal where everyone has the right to thrive.

Too often, the stories of frontline communities are erased. Consider the Senegalese women fish processors who are protesting against industrial overfishing and transhipment practices that are connected to human rights abuses. There are also survivors of slavery within supply chains, and marginalized groups suffering from the impacts of toxic facilities.

At Greenpeace, we are committed to amplifying these voices, addressing systemic oppression, and drawing lessons from upheavals like the pandemic and demands for racial justice. Through this, we aim to stand with and support those who are most affected.
