Healthy oceans play a crucial role in combating climate change by absorbing CO2 in two key ways. First, through phytoplankton, which capture CO2 and transfer carbon through the food chain to the ocean depths. Second, via seawater dissolution, where CO2 is carried by currents, locking away billions of tonnes annually.

Oceans also absorb over 90% of the extra heat from global warming, which helps cool the land. However, this absorption leads to acidification, harm to marine life, supercharged storms, reef destruction, and rising sea levels.

Protecting oceans, such as through sanctuaries, enhances these natural processes. At the same time, tackling climate change benefits the oceans, highlighting their mutual interdependence for overall stability.
