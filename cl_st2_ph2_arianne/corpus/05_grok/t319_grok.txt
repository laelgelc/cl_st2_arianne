Greenpeace recently marked its 50th anniversary by hosting a global design contest that drew over 200 entries from supporters around the world. A panel of judges, which included Thai street artist Muebon along with representatives from Brazil, Hong Kong, Indonesia, the Philippines, Russia, Norway, and Africa, chose the winning designs that reflect the organization's rich history and its vision for the future.

The top prize went to Leire Dominguez from Barcelona, whose artwork depicts a peace dove shaped like the number "50" emerging from a Greenpeace ship. This design symbolizes the organization's journey from early anti-nuclear campaigns to broader fights for environmental justice.

Among the shortlisted entries was one by Russian artist Nickolay Drozdovskiy, whose work draws inspiration from the theme of protecting our planet.

We're looking forward to more anniversary celebrations and giving shout-outs to additional shortlisted designs in the coming days.
