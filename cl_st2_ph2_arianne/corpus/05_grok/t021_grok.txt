Every year, the Free Land Camp in Brasília brings together thousands of Indigenous Peoples to call on the government to recognize their lands. The 19th edition of this event is taking place from April 24 to 28.

Demarcation of Indigenous territories is a constitutional right in Brazil. It safeguards these areas from invasions and helps preserve the livelihoods, cultures, and forests of Indigenous communities.

Despite this, only 30.8% of the claimed areas have been officially recognized. Out of 1,393 Indigenous lands, 871 are still awaiting action.

Invasions by loggers and miners are rampant in many regions. Illegal gold mining, often involving excavators, is particularly destructive in territories like those of the Yanomami, Kayapó, and Munduruku Peoples. These activities lead to widespread environmental destruction, mercury contamination, and violence.

Protecting Indigenous lands is essential for maintaining global biodiversity and climate balance.
