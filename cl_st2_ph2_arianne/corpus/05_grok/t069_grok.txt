In the heart of South Africa's Mpumalanga Highveld, community activist Fana Isaac Sibanyoni from Embalenhle is leading the charge against severe air pollution caused by coal-fired power plants, refineries such as Sasol, and extensive mining activities. As a dedicated advocate, he works tirelessly to engage municipalities, companies, and local communities, pushing authorities to improve air quality and protect public health.

Sibanyoni focuses on education and holding polluters accountable, ensuring that constitutional rights to a clean environment are respected and upheld. This region has been officially declared a pollution hotspot, plagued by elevated levels of NO2 and SO2, which contribute to widespread respiratory illnesses, cancer, strokes, and premature deaths among residents.

Despite a significant 2022 court ruling that affirmed the rights of local people to a healthier environment, industries and government entities frequently disregard these concerns, leaving communities to bear the ongoing burden.
