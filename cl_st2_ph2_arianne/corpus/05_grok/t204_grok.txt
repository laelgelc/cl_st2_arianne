The Greenpeace ship Esperanza, which means 'Hope' in Spanish, has a remarkable history spanning over 20 years. Originally a Russian fire-fighting vessel, it was renamed through an online vote and became a vital part of our fleet.

Throughout its service, Esperanza carried crews and activists who took bold actions against pirate fishing, whaling, and other environmental crimes. These efforts often took place in remote and challenging locations, such as the Antarctic and West Africa. The ship also supported scientific studies and delivered crucial aid during major disasters, including the 2010 Haiti earthquake and the 2012 Typhoon Bopha in the Philippines.

As the fastest vessel in our fleet and equipped with ice-class capabilities, Esperanza truly embodied the hope it was named for. It navigated harsh conditions to stand up for the planet and its people.

Now, after decades of dedicated service, Esperanza has been retired and is docked in Gijón, Spain. This decision stems from its carbon footprint, even after undergoing green upgrades, as we commit to a zero-carbon future. Yet, the spirit of Esperanza lives on, inspiring our ongoing work for environmental justice.
