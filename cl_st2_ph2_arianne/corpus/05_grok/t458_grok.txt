Have you heard about the powerful new documentary "The Story of Plastic"? This film shines a spotlight on global activists who are battling plastic pollution in places like Houston, Jakarta, and Delhi. It's a must-watch for anyone concerned about our planet's future.

You can catch the broadcast premiere on the Discovery Channel on Earth Day, April 22. Or get an early look with the digital pre-premiere on DiscoveryGo starting April 15. Other options include video-on-demand rentals and virtual community screenings available through storyofplastic.org.

In this piece written by Shilpi from Break Free From Plastic, the documentary challenges industry narratives that blame consumers and Asia for the plastic crisis. Instead, it reveals plastic's roots in fossil fuels, the emissions from production in areas like Houston, and the waste crises overwhelming Southeast Asia. The film connects these issues to climate change and the health impacts on marginalized communities, calling for urgent systemic change to address the root causes.
