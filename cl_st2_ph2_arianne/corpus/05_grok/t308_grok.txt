In the fight against the climate crisis, "Net Zero" pledges have become a popular buzzword among governments and corporations. But let's be clear: these pledges are often deceptive and insufficient. They rely on the flawed assumption that emissions from one place can simply be offset by carbon removal in another, without acknowledging the real-world limitations. For instance, resources like land for reforestation are finite, and once fossil carbon is released into the atmosphere, its effects are permanent and can't be easily undone.

This approach allows cheap carbon credits to prop up business-as-usual practices for big polluters. Corporations continue their high-emission activities while claiming progress, but the real burden falls unfairly on marginalized communities, who often bear the brunt of environmental degradation and displacement caused by these so-called solutions.

Instead of this misleading framework, we need separate and transparent targets that address the crisis head-on. This means setting goals for rapid reductions in fossil fuel and industrial emissions, tackling land-use impacts such as deforestation and meat and dairy production, and prioritizing rights-based protection of nature.

It's crucial to focus on immediate cuts to fossil fuels rather than banking on unproven technologies like carbon capture and storage (CCS). True progress requires collaboration across all sectors of society to prevent crossing irreversible tipping points in our climate system. By demanding these changes, we can push for the real action needed to safeguard our planet.
