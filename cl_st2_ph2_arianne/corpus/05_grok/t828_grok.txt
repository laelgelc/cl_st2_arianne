Greenpeace has been campaigning against Thai Union, the world's largest canned tuna company, to push for reforms in the destructive seafood industry. This industry is plagued by forced labor, illegal fishing, ocean destruction, and untraceable supply chains.

After two years of pressure from activists and consumers, Thai Union is now engaging with Greenpeace and considering major changes. These include reducing destructive fishing, minimizing labor abuse, tackling illegal fishing and overfishing, and ensuring full traceability.

Such shifts could force improvements across the entire industry.

A video featuring internet cats, mermaids, sharks, turtles, and activists urges immediate, sweeping reforms.

Thai Union owns brands like Chicken of the Sea and supplies Walmart. Supporters are called to demand action.
