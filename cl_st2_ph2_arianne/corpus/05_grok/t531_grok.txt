In Tanjung Taruna Village, Central Kalimantan, Indonesia, Nasrullah serves as the chairperson of the Forest Fire Community. He recalls the devastating forest fires of 2015, which forced evacuations in the area. Since then, efforts have continued each dry season to prevent and extinguish fires.

This year, the fires began escalating in July, prompting a state of emergency declaration in six provinces. Government responses, such as water bombs, have proven insufficient. Greenpeace Indonesia's team, along with local residents, have been working tirelessly to combat the fires. However, as the smoke intensified, air quality deteriorated severely, with the Air Quality Index (AQI) surpassing 300 and even reaching 2000 in some areas. This haze has also impacted neighboring countries, diminishing hopes for quick resolution.

Nasrullah calls on the government to enforce laws against those responsible for starting the fires and to implement robust policies for protecting peatlands, aiming to put an end to these recurring disasters.
