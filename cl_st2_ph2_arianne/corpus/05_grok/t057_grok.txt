In 2009, Typhoon Ketsana struck the Philippines, flooding Virginia's home in San Mateo and destroying her belongings. The event left her with lasting trauma, but she considers herself lucky compared to others who lost loved ones.

This personal experience motivated Virginia to organize a petition to the Philippine Human Rights Commission. The commission's findings held fossil fuel companies morally and legally liable for climate damage, citing their actions in misleading the public and blocking clean energy.

Today, as a Greenpeace climate campaigner, Virginia collaborates with communities affected by climate impacts, including crop losses, reduced catches, and income cuts. She is currently aboard the Arctic Sunrise, participating in actions to block Shell, with demands that the company stop drilling and pay for the injustice shouldered by those least responsible.
