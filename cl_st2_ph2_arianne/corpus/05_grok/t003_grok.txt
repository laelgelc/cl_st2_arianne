On World Environment Day, I feel immense pride in Greenpeace's global pioneers—our volunteers, supporters, activists, and campaigners—who tirelessly celebrate every day as environment day. Their passion inspires us to persevere amid the visible impacts of climate change in our daily lives.

The post highlights extreme weather that's beyond normal, yet ignored by world leaders. This includes Shanghai's hottest May day in 100 years and Italy's severe flooding, which caused widespread damage and over a dozen deaths. Heat waves and these extremes are now routine, but they shouldn't be the new normal.

Images of these global difficulties should motivate us all to unify in action against climate change.
