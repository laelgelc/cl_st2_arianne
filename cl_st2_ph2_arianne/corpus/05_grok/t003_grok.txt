On World Environment Day, I feel immense pride in Greenpeace's global community of volunteers, supporters, activists, and campaigners who work tirelessly to protect the environment every single day. Their passion inspires us to keep going, even as we witness the visible impacts of climate change, like extreme weather events. Yet leaders are ignoring these warnings, as seen in Shanghai experiencing its hottest May day in 100 years and Italy facing severe flooding that caused widespread damage and over a dozen deaths. Such events should not become the new normal, and the accompanying images highlight the difficulties we're facing around the world, urging us all to unite in the fight against climate change.
