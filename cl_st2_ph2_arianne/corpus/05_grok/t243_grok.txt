Rex Weyler, reflecting on his 50 years of activism, draws inspiration from his mentor Ira Sandperl, who shared a simple secret to organizing: "Be organized." He stresses the importance of seeking truth through relentless research, while steering clear of echo chambers and confirmation bias. Weyler advocates embracing a deep diversity of ideas and practicing deep ecology to gain a better understanding of nature's workings. He points to the need for localized solutions that focus on community ecosystems and self-reliance. Creativity, he notes, flourishes in inclusive environments. Addressing overshoot, which he describes as the deeper crisis beyond climate change, calls for reduced consumption. For effective communication, Weyler recommends using narratives to disrupt cultural myths. Finally, he highlights the role of personal growth through self-examination and quieting the ego.
