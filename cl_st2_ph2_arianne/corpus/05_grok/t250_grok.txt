As we approach COP26, the urgency for immediate climate action has never been clearer. To meet the Paris Agreement's goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, world leaders must step up now. People power is making a real difference, with activism and legal wins pushing for change and holding polluters accountable.

Yet, the national emission plans submitted so far are woefully insufficient, projecting a dangerous 2.7 degrees Celsius of warming if we stay on this path.

At Greenpeace, we're demanding bold steps: an immediate stop to all new fossil fuel projects and a phase-out of the entire industry, ensuring just transitions for workers and communities. We call for ambitious plans from all countries to halve emissions by 2030 and achieve net zero by 2050, with rich nations leading the way.

Rules for international cooperation must be equitable, rejecting carbon offsets that are nothing more than scams. And finally, the long-promised $100 billion in annual climate finance must be fulfilled for vulnerable countries, supporting clean energy transitions, adaptation efforts, and compensation for loss and damage.
