Hollywood and the automotive industry often paint a picture of future transportation dominated by sleek, personal cars zooming through high-tech cities. But this vision is deeply unsustainable, prioritizing individual vehicles over collective well-being and environmental health.

Instead, we should champion efficient public transport systems like trains, buses, and trams. These not only cut down on energy consumption but also act as a vital social safety net, ensuring accessible mobility for everyone.

Look at the thriving networks in cities such as Moscow, Beijing, and Auckland, where public transport efficiently moves millions while minimizing environmental impact.

It's time to drastically reduce our reliance on cars. Doing so would clean up air quality and free up vast urban spaces currently wasted on parking lots, like the sprawling ones in Los Angeles that could be repurposed for greener uses.

For those essential trips where public options aren't feasible, shared electric vehicles offer a practical alternative.

We must also encourage more walking and cycling, drawing inspiration from successes in London and Copenhagen, where these modes have transformed daily life.

Recently, a protest in Frankfurt highlighted the car industry's massive contribution to the climate crisis, demanding accountability.
