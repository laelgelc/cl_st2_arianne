Our oceans are under siege from multiple threats: climate breakdown, plastic pollution, overfishing, and the emerging danger of deep sea mining. This mining targets polymetallic nodules on the ocean floor, which contain metals used in electronics.

In the deep sea, unique species depend on these ecosystems. The Ghost Octopus lays its eggs on sponges that grow on these nodules and dies while protecting them. The armored Sea Pangolin is sustained by bacteria in this environment. The Yeti Crab farms microbes on its hairy arms, and its females die after breeding.

Deep sea mining would cause irreparable damage to these ecosystems, disrupt species, and exacerbate climate issues by affecting carbon stores in the ocean.

Instead of mining, we can turn to alternatives like circular economies, e-waste recycling, and greater resource efficiency.

Join us in urging action: sign the petition for a strong Global Ocean Treaty to create ocean sanctuaries and stop destructive industries.
