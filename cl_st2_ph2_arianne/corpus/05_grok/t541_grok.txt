Joanna Sustento, a climate activist from Tacloban in the Philippines, shares her heartbreaking experience of losing most of her family during the 2013 super typhoon Haiyan, an event exacerbated by climate change. She has chosen not to remain silent while lives and livelihoods are sacrificed for corporate profits, drawing on her personal strength and the support she has found along her journey.

In a powerful letter addressed to Shell and the broader oil industry, Joanna demands justice for her nephew Tarin, who was lost in the storm, and for the thousands of others killed in the devastated communities. She calls on the industry to take immediate action to mitigate the impacts of the climate crisis before it's too late, warning that even their own families' futures hang in the balance.
