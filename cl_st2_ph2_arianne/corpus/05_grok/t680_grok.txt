In the heart of Norway, young activist Andreas Randøy is channeling his passion through Nature and Youth and Greenpeace to challenge the country's oil industry. As climate change brings devastating impacts, such as farming disasters, Andreas is determined to push for change.

Drawing inspiration from Greta Thunberg, Andreas took action by organizing school strikes that drew nearly 1,000 participants. These efforts highlighted the urgent need to address environmental threats.

Alongside fellow activists, Andreas sued the Norwegian government over Arctic oil drilling, arguing that it violates constitutional rights to a healthy environment. Although they lost the initial court round, they have appealed the decision.

Norway often projects an eco-friendly image, but this masks its status as a major oil exporter. Andreas addresses concerns about job losses by pointing out that alternative opportunities exist.

Emphasizing the vision of young people for a shift to renewables, Andreas calls for immediate action to achieve global justice.
