Today marks the 36th anniversary of the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster. A safety test at reactor 4 triggered an explosion and a massive release of radioactive material, contaminating Ukraine, Europe, and beyond. This catastrophe forced evacuations, incurred costs of $700 billion, and left areas uninhabitable for the long term.

The nuclear industry continues to promote itself as safe and green, including through EU taxonomy plans, while engaging in ongoing obfuscation.

We draw parallels to Russia's 2022 invasion, during which Chernobyl and Zaporizhzhia nuclear plants were seized, posing catastrophic risks to Ukraine's nuclear facilities.
