In the iconic 1967 film The Graduate, a young Benjamin Braddock receives one word of advice for his future: "plastics." That single word captured the optimism of an era, but since the 1950s, the explosive rise of plastics has turned into a global crisis, flooding our oceans with pollution.

Today, vast areas like the North Pacific gyre are choked with plastic debris, where it outweighs plankton and wreaks havoc on marine life. Seabirds, turtles, fish, and mammals ingest this plastic, leading to internal obstructions and toxic effects. The toll is staggering: up to a million seabirds and 100,000 marine mammals die each year from these impacts.

To combat this, we need bold action. Global bans on single-use plastics, combined with corporate accountability through Extended Producer Responsibility, can make a real difference. Investing in public water infrastructure is another key step to reduce reliance on disposable items.

At Greenpeace, we're calling on G20 nations to step up: prioritize prevention, phase out throwaway plastics, and drive innovation toward sustainable alternatives. Together, we can turn the tide on ocean pollution.
