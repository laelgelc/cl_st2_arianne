Bees are fascinating creatures, and understanding their world can shed light on broader environmental challenges. In a hive, the difference between queen bees and worker bees stems from how long they consume royal jelly. Queens, who feed on it throughout their development, live much longer, grow larger, and can lay millions of eggs over their lifetimes.

Korean beekeeping has a rich history dating back to the Three Kingdoms period, when it began to spread across the region. Bees have long symbolized diligence in Korean culture, reflecting their tireless work ethic.

However, Korea's honeybee population has faced a sharp 16% decline by early 2022, driven by factors like the climate crisis, parasites, pesticides, and the loss of plants. This alarming trend calls for urgent action, including the establishment of a government committee to address these threats.

Did you know that bees evolved from carnivorous ancestors around 100 million years ago? They have five eyes and communicate through dances to make collective decisions. Worker bees take on different duties based on their age, and their lifespans vary by season. These insects feed on nectar and pollen from honey plants, and producing just one jar of honey requires them to forage across vast distances, visiting millions of flowers.
