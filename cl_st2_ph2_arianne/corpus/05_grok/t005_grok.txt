Have you ever wondered what makes a queen bee so different from a worker bee? It all comes down to royal jelly. While worker bees consume royal jelly only briefly, queens eat it for a prolonged period, which allows them to live longer, grow larger, and lay millions of eggs throughout their lives.

Beekeeping in Korea has a rich history dating back to the Three Kingdoms period, when it began to spread widely. Bees were seen as symbols of diligence and wealth in those times.

Unfortunately, in 2022, Korea lost 16% of its honeybees. This decline is linked to the climate crisis, parasites, fewer honey plants, and pesticides. That's why we're calling for the establishment of a "Save the Honeybees Committee" to help protect these vital pollinators.

Here are 10 fascinating facts about bees to highlight their importance:

1. Bees evolved from carnivorous ancestors.

2. Bees have five eyes.

3. Bees make democratic decisions through dances.

4. Bees have duties that change based on their age.

5. Bees' lifespans vary by season.

6. Bees rely on honey plants for their survival.

7. Producing honey requires extensive foraging efforts by bees.
