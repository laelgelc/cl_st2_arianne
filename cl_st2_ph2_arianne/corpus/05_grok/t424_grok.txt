Siberia has become a stark hotspot in the global climate crisis, where massive mega fires are devastating the vast Taiga forests and sending thick haze over Russian cities. Inadequate resourcing of firefighting efforts by authorities is putting communities at risk and intensifying the impacts of climate change.

Since 2020, an area of 19 million hectares—larger than the entire country of Greece—has been scorched by these fires, primarily in Far Eastern Russia and Eastern Siberia. The resulting smoke has severely degraded air quality, leading to increased respiratory problems, especially amid the ongoing challenges of COVID-19.

Greenpeace Russia has been on the ground, documenting the fires in regions like Krasnoyarsk. We've also mobilized volunteers to fight rare and intense blazes in the Denezhkin Kamen nature reserve near the Urals, which were sparked by prolonged drought, extreme heatwaves, and lightning strikes.

This situation underscores a true climate emergency. It's critical that authorities reverse the cutbacks in forest protection measures to protect both people and the planet.
