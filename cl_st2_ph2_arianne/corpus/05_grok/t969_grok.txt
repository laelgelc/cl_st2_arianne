In recent years, we've seen a disturbing rise in SLAPP suits—Strategic Litigation Against Public Participation—deployed by corporations and governments to intimidate and silence environmental activists. These lawsuits often involve massive damage claims and crippling legal costs, aiming to deter public participation in critical environmental issues.

Take, for instance, Essar's multiple lawsuits against Greenpeace India, stemming from protests against coal mining in the Mahan forest. Similarly, Tata Sons attempted a takedown request that was ultimately denied. In another case, Shell sought an injunction against Greenpeace Netherlands, but it failed. Resolute filed a defamation claim against Greenpeace Canada, while Russia brought charges against the Arctic 30 activists. Even in Mexico, authorities charged a protester against PEMEX.

At Greenpeace, we're calling for robust anti-SLAPP legislation to safeguard environmental defenders and preserve open democratic debate on these vital matters.
