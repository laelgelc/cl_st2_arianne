Antarctic krill are tiny, alien-like creatures that play a vital role in the Antarctic Ocean's food web. They serve as essential prey for penguins, seabirds, seals, fish, and migrating whales such as blue and humpback whales. These remarkable animals exhibit bioluminescence and form massive swarms that can reach up to 30,000 individuals per cubic meter. Krill can moult their shells to evade predators or even shrink their bodies to conserve energy.

Beyond their ecological importance, krill act as climate heroes by capturing carbon and depositing it on the seafloor. Yet, they face serious threats from industrial fishing, which targets them for products like Omega-3 pills and fish food. This situation has led to urgent calls for establishing the world's largest ocean sanctuary to protect the Antarctic.
