In a significant step forward for environmental protection, Greenpeace Argentina, together with allied organizations, initiated a class action lawsuit challenging the government's approval of Equinor's seismic exploration activities in the Argentine Sea. The lawsuit pointed to the unconstitutionality of the approval and highlighted serious risks to marine life and coastal communities.

This legal action ignited the #Atlanticazo movement, which mobilized widespread protests across the region, drawing attention to the threats posed by such projects.

The Federal Court in Mar del Plata responded by granting a precautionary measure that suspends the project indefinitely. The court's decision underscores the importance of transparency and citizen participation, as well as adherence to the Escazú Agreement. It also calls for a comprehensive environmental impact assessment that considers cumulative effects and applies the precautionary principle.

The ruling specifically addresses potential dangers, including oil spills and harm to ecosystems, representing a key victory for collective public efforts in the face of persistent climate concerns.
