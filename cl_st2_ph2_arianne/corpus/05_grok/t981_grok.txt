Greenpeace Italy is thrilled to celebrate the Benetton Group's commitment to eliminate all hazardous chemical releases from its global supply chain and products by 2020. This pledge follows similar commitments from Zara, Mango, Esprit, and Levi’s, all in response to activist and consumer pressure. Competitors like Calvin Klein, GAP, and G-Star Raw appear out of touch, especially now that 13 major brands have committed to detox. We urge more fashion houses to join this movement. Share the "Detox Fashion" video to pressure brands like Victoria’s Secret to adopt non-hazardous alternatives and end pollution.
