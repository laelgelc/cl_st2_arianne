The Indonesian government is quick to blame the devastating floods ravaging Borneo on heavy rainfall, but this narrative ignores the real culprits: rampant deforestation driven by palm oil plantations, mining concessions, and lax environmental policies. These activities have stripped away vital forest cover, leaving communities more vulnerable to disasters like the ones we're seeing now.

The recently passed Omnibus Law exacerbates the problem by dismantling key protections, such as the requirement for 30% forest cover in provinces. This opens the door for unchecked corporate exploitation, further eroding the natural barriers that once shielded against flooding and other climate impacts.

As a Greenpeace campaigner, I've been part of the fight against this destruction for years. I remember our 2015 lawsuit victory that challenged similar environmental rollbacks and held decision-makers accountable.

Now, more than ever, we must unite to safeguard Borneo's incredible biodiversity, push for a transition to renewable energy, and put planetary health first—especially as we navigate the intertwined crises of climate change and COVID-19.
