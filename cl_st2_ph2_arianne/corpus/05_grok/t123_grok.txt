The Amazon rainforest is facing unprecedented shrinkage from rampant deforestation and intentional fires. These destructive practices are largely fueled by agribusiness and meat consumption, which have led to the conversion of 75% of deforested public lands into cattle pastures. Illegal fires, frequently ignited by land grabbers, pose severe threats to Indigenous peoples, the region's rich biodiversity, and the global climate.

Under Bolsonaro's anti-environment policies, deforestation surged by 52.9%. In early 2022, fires increased by 16.7%, accelerating the forest's decline toward a critical tipping point. If 20-25% of the Amazon is lost, it could irreversibly transform into a savanna.

To combat this crisis, key solutions involve enforcing existing laws, establishing protected areas, recognizing Indigenous rights, and reforming the global food system to halt further destruction.
