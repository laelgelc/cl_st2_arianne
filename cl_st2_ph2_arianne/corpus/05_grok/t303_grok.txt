Pride Month traces its roots back to the 1969 Stonewall Riots, where protests erupted against inequality and injustice. At Greenpeace, we see clear connections between this fight and climate justice, as marginalized communities are often the hardest hit by environmental crises.

We celebrate diversity and stand firmly in support of LGBTQ+ rights, recognizing that a just future depends on equality for all.

Since 2018, Greenpeace has proudly participated in Pride events around the world. It began in Amsterdam, and in 2019, we joined the celebrations in Brazil, where high rates of violence underscore the urgency of the cause. We also took part in Mexico City, where equal rights laws are advancing, and in Taiwan in 2020, even amid the pandemic, to spotlight the links between social and environmental justice.

Our commitment to solidarity continues, as we work together for a more inclusive and sustainable world.
