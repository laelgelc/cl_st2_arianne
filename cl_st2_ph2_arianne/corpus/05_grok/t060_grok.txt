The Yanomami Land stands as Brazil's largest Indigenous territory, bordering Venezuela and home to 20,000 Indigenous people. Yet this vital area faces a severe threat from an invasion of 20,000 illegal miners, resulting in widespread environmental destruction, pollution of rivers, and a deepening humanitarian crisis.

The use of mercury in mining operations is poisoning food sources and water supplies, contributing to severe health issues and deaths among the population. Miners are also spreading diseases such as malaria, with 11,530 cases reported in 2022, alongside rising malnutrition, particularly affecting children.

Illegal mining activities escalated dramatically by 1,963% between 2019 and 2021 during the Bolsonaro administration. In 2022, a 150-km illegal road was observed, enabling even more damage to the region.

The arrival of the new Lula government brings a shift, including the establishment of the Ministry of Indigenous Peoples led by Sônia Guajajara. This development indicates a commitment to implementing systemic protections for Indigenous rights and the inhabitants of the Amazon.
