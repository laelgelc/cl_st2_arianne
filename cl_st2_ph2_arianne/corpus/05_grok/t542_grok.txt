Last Friday saw an incredible turnout as four million people around the world joined what became the largest climate protest in history. From Jakarta to Antarctica, participants came together, drawing inspiration from the courageous act of a 15-year-old the year before.

While many were out marching, some Greenpeace staff stayed behind to share stories from the day. We found it deeply inspiring, filled with passion, energy, creativity, and humor that brought tears to our eyes.

This historic event featured some truly memorable protest signs—here are a few of our favorites.

We're already looking forward to the next global strike on September 27th.
