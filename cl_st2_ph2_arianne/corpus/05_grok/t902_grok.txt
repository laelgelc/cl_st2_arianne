The North Sea holds a hidden world of diving beauty, as described by Annet van Aarsen. Its clear waters reveal vibrant wrecks teeming with anemones, fish, crabs, lobsters, nudibranchs, and tube worms. Annet began her diving journey in 2001, with her first North Sea dive in 2002. Over the years, she has witnessed troubling declines, such as the vanishing cod and the increasing presence of ghost nets that trap marine life.

In 2009, Annet started volunteer cleanups and began documenting these issues to raise awareness. She joined the Ghost Fishing Foundation in 2012. Currently, aboard Greenpeace's Arctic Sunrise, Annet and eight other divers are removing nets from wrecks in the Sylter Aussenriff area. This effort highlights the need for real protection in the region while showcasing its fragile ecosystem.
