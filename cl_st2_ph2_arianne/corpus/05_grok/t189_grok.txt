At just 22 years old, Farzana Faruk Jhumu is a dedicated climate activist with Fridays for Future MAPA and FFF Bangladesh. She has been vocal in her criticism of global leaders at COP26, pointing out their failure to adequately address the climate crisis and their continued support for fossil fuels. Despite these shortcomings, activists from the Global South, including Jhumu, managed to overcome significant travel barriers to attend and demand climate justice.

Jhumu expresses deep frustration over the minimal progress made on critical issues such as climate debt and loss and damage. She underscores the vital role that youth advocacy plays in challenging systems of oppression. To keep the momentum going, she is promoting the global climate strike on March 25, organized under the banner #PeopleNotProfit, which prioritizes people over corporate greed.

Reflecting on her own path, Jhumu shares how she was inspired by the devastating impacts of Cyclone Sidr, her involvement in community work, and her experience sailing to the COP on Greenpeace’s Rainbow Warrior. She also speaks to the challenges of activist burnout, emphasizing the importance of community support in sustaining the fight.
