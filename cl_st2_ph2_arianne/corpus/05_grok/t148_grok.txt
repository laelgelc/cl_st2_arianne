Children born in 2020 will face intensified climate change impacts like extreme weather and rising seas by 2100 unless governments cut emissions, protect ecosystems, and promote green energy. Gen-Z and millennials can use art for awareness, learn from resources like Vanessa Nakate’s book, pursue legal actions against polluters, share personal stories, and recognize systemic injustices. Highlighted youth leaders from Africa inspire action, with suggestions including joining FridaysForFuture strikes, signing petitions, using social media, and protecting green spaces, as in the successful campaign to save a Nairobi fig tree.
