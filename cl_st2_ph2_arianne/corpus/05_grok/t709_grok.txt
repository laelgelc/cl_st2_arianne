An updated Census of Earth’s Biomass highlights the profound ways humanity has disrupted species diversity on our planet, primarily through habitat loss, deforestation, and extinctions. According to this census, plants dominate more than 80% of the global biomass, with the majority being terrestrial. In contrast, animals make up just 0.37% of the total, and within that category, arthropods account for half of the animal mass.

The census also reveals stark imbalances in mammal biomass: humans and livestock constitute 96% of it, vastly outweighing the biomass of wild mammals. Human activities have significantly altered the Earth's biomass over time. Since the dawn of agriculture, global biomass has been halved. Fish stocks have been depleted by 85-90%, and 70% of forests have been destroyed. Additionally, insect populations have declined due to pesticides.

To preserve biodiversity, it is essential to halt habitat destruction.
