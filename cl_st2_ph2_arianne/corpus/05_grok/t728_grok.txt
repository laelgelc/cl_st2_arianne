Delhi's air pollution is worsening, and India's complacency stands in stark contrast to the actions taken in China and London, where public anger has driven change. Air pollution acts as a silent killer. An LSU study proposes 13 measures that could cut pollution by 40%, prevent 900,000 premature deaths annually, and reduce winter PM2.5 by 50-60% in North India, particularly by curbing coal plant emissions. These measures align with recommendations made to the Ministry. India is finalizing a National Clean Air Programme, but its implementation requires mindset shifts and people-led movements. Smog has ruined winters and caused health impacts. PM Modi's 2022 single-use plastic ban overshadowed air issues. Unlike China, India's public outrage remains seasonal, which hinders progress.
