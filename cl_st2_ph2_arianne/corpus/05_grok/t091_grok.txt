In the heart of South Africa's South Durban Industrial Basin, communities like Wentworth bear the brunt of severe ecological damage from pollution. This environmental degradation is not just a matter of air and water quality—it's deeply intertwined with rising levels of gender-based violence and femicide (GBVF). The situation is worsened by climate change, which has roots in patriarchal colonialism, creating layers of harm that disproportionately affect womxn and girls.

Factories and refineries in the area release pollutants that contaminate the surroundings, intensifying existing gender inequalities. These industrial operations contribute to widespread poverty, making it harder for womxn and girls to escape cycles of vulnerability and risk. At the same time, employment in these sectors remains overwhelmingly male-dominated, which reinforces economic disparities and leaves womxn with fewer opportunities for financial independence.

To address this interconnected crisis, we need an intersectional approach that recognizes how environmental justice and gender justice are linked. This means integrating just energy transitions—shifting away from polluting fossil fuels toward sustainable alternatives—directly into policies aimed at combating GBVF. By doing so, we can work toward achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and begin dismantling the underlying systems of oppression that fuel both ecological harm and gender-based violence.
