Thai mackerel, which was once abundant and affordable in Thailand, has become scarce due to unregulated overfishing of juveniles. Catches in 2020 were ten times lower than in 2014. The fish that remain are smaller, often imported, and more expensive, which threatens food security for the poor.

Local fishers from 23 provinces have campaigned against the catching of juveniles. They have established nurseries and urged supermarkets to stop sales of these young fish.

The fishers organized the "Reclaim Mackerel Chili Paste" voyage, sailing over 1,000 km from Pattani to Bangkok's parliament on World Oceans Day. Their demand was for the enforcement of Section 57 of the Fisheries Act.

Media coverage of the voyage raised awareness and prompted a promise from the government. However, no action has followed, leading the fishers to issue a 60-day ultimatum.
