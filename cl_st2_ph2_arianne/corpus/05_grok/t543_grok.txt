McDonald’s, KFC, and Burger King have the power and responsibility to stand against the destruction of the Amazon rainforest. Here are five key reasons why these fast-food giants must take action now.

First, their collective pressure could push President Bolsonaro to safeguard the forest, especially as global outcry intensifies over the ongoing devastation.

Second, the Amazon plays a crucial role in regulating the global climate through carbon storage, water vapor production, and rainfall generation. It also supports Indigenous Peoples and immense biodiversity, helping to avert disasters like droughts, famines, heatwaves, and storms.

Third, these companies purchase Brazilian beef and chicken fed on soya, which directly contributes to deliberate fires set to clear land for agriculture.

Fourth, despite their promises to halt deforestation, they persist in sourcing from suppliers linked to destruction and in fueling demand for meat that drives this cycle.

Fifth, other businesses are already stepping up: companies like H&M, Timberland, and Vans, along with salmon producers and investors, are rejecting Brazilian products in response to the crisis.
