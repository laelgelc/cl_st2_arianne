In April 2014, the Republic of the Marshall Islands filed lawsuits at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) against nine nuclear-armed nations. This March, the ICJ heard preliminary oral arguments from the Marshall Islands against the UK, India, and Pakistan. These cases are rooted in the U.S. nuclear tests conducted between 1946 and 1958, which contaminated the islands and led to severe radiation impacts on the people there. In 1985, Greenpeace's Rainbow Warrior helped relocate residents from Rongelap Atoll due to these ongoing effects.

Tony de Brum, a key figure in the Marshall Islands' efforts, has shared heartbreaking stories from the 1954 fallout, including how children mistook the radioactive ash for snow and even ate it. The Marshall Islands is alleging that these nuclear-armed nations have breached international law by failing to pursue good-faith negotiations for nuclear disarmament.

A decision from the ICJ is expected in about six months. At Greenpeace, we fully support this courageous effort by the Marshall Islands to hold these nations accountable and push for a world free from nuclear weapons.
