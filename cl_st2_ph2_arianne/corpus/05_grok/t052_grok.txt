The climate crisis is intensifying rainfall and flooding across Indonesia, severely affecting coffee production and the small-scale producers who manage 90% of the country's plantations. In Central Java, Lady Farmer Coffee stands out as a women-run plantation founded in 2016 by Wiwi and two other women. This initiative empowers female farmers by cultivating 273 Sigarar Utang coffee trees and overseeing every stage of production, from planting to processing.

However, excessive rain brought on by the climate crisis has disrupted tree growth, reduced bean sweetness, complicated the drying process, and lowered overall quality. Compounding these challenges are rising electricity costs that strain operations.

To address these issues, Lady Farmer Coffee has installed solar panels through the Diversity Movement, which includes Greenpeace Indonesia. This renewable energy solution has cut drying time by 40%, reduced costs by 35%, lowered emissions, and helped maintain coffee quality. At the same time, it promotes the use of clean energy and highlights the vital roles women play in the coffee industry.
