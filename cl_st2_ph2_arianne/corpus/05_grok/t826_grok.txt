In 1962, Rachel Carson's groundbreaking book Silent Spring brought attention to the devastating effects of DDT on birds, which ultimately led to bans on the pesticide. These actions helped save species like ospreys from further decline. However, despite these successes, global bird populations are now facing accelerated losses due to ongoing threats including pesticides, habitat loss, climate change, cats, and other factors.

The scale of the crisis is staggering. In North America alone, 1.5 billion birds have disappeared over the past 40 years, with specific species suffering even more dramatically—Rufous hummingbirds, for instance, have seen a 60% drop. Human activities are at the heart of this problem, from agriculture and urban sprawl to collisions that claim countless lives.

History provides stark examples of misguided interventions, such as Mao's failed campaign to eradicate sparrows in China, which backfired and disrupted ecosystems. Today, extinctions like that of the Po'ouli bird highlight the broader loss of biodiversity, with species vanishing at rates 1,000 to 10,000 times higher than natural background levels. These declines are profoundly impacting ecosystems worldwide, underscoring the urgent need to address the root causes driven by human actions.
