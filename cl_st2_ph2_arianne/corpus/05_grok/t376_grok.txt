The fragility of life has been starkly revealed through events like the COVID-19 pandemic, as highlighted in a blog post by Sônia Guajajara. She urges immediate care for Mother Earth to prevent new pandemics arising from biodiversity destruction. Indigenous Peoples warn that human life is deeply interconnected with nature, and predatory economic models put everyone's future at risk.

Since colonial invasions, Brazilian Indigenous groups have adapted their strategies to fight for their rights, making use of the Constitution in their efforts. In a significant step, the Articulation of Indigenous Peoples of Brazil (APIB), together with allies such as Greenpeace Brazil and political parties, has filed a case in the Supreme Court. This action aims to compel the government to protect the Amazon, forests, waters, and all forms of life.
