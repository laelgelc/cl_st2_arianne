I remember the moment I stepped aboard the Greenpeace ship Arctic Sunrise for my first sea action. We were out there protesting Shell's "red monster" FPSO, that massive vessel on its way to extract oil from the Penguins field in the North Sea. My heart was pounding—I felt scared, but also this rush of excitement. There was anger too, deep anger at the greed of fossil fuel companies and the inaction of governments that's leading to disasters that could be avoided, like those hitting places such as Cameroon.

I worried about what this all means for future generations, how the climate impacts will affect them. And yes, the seasickness hit me hard, but even through that, there was this incredible elation. It's from seeing the global resistance—communities, women, and youth all rising up together. We're demanding an end to fossil fuels, accountability for loss and damage, and a just transition to clean energy.
