Activists recently disrupted the African Energy Summit in London to draw attention to neo-colonial oil extraction practices in Africa, which are worsening poverty in nations that were formerly colonized. The spotlight is on Canadian firm ReconAfrica's proposed drilling in the Kavango region of Namibia and Botswana, including the Okavango Delta. This project risks releasing massive CO2 emissions equivalent to one-sixth of the global carbon budget, which would violate the goals of the Paris Agreement.

Such drilling poses serious threats to biodiversity and endangered species like cheetahs and rhinos, as well as to local water supplies, tourism, and the livelihoods of Indigenous San communities. Youth and Indigenous activists, including Ina-Marie Shikongo and Q7 Beckett, are calling for an immediate halt to these plans. They point out the lack of proper consultation with affected communities and the potential for widespread devastation.
