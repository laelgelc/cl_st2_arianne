Plastic pollution is at the heart of a major environmental crisis, surrounded by confusion and misinformation. The WHY PLASTIC? three-part documentary series by THE WHY Foundation delves into these issues, critiquing the reliance on recycling and self-regulation as inadequate solutions.

The series calls on big brands, such as Coca-Cola, which has been named the top plastic polluter, to move away from single-use packaging and adopt reuse and refill models instead.

In "The Recycling Myth," the documentary exposes the failures of recycling, revealing practices like waste export, incineration, bribery, fraud, and greenwashing within this multi-billion industry.

"Coca-Cola’s Plastic Promises" uncovers the flaws in Coke's 'World Without Waste' strategy.

Through this campaign, the aim is to raise awareness about these problems, with the series reaching over 100 million people worldwide.
