At Greenpeace, we're calling out the failures of COP26, which has amplified carbon offsetting schemes that amount to nothing more than scams. These offsets put Indigenous Peoples at risk, threaten biodiversity, and undermine the critical 1.5°C climate goal. The supposed benefits are often impossible to verify, and they frequently result in land grabbing and the displacement of communities.

Take, for instance, airlines that claim to offset emissions from flights by funding forest protection projects. Then there's TotalEnergies, which is drilling for oil in Congo's peatlands while compensating through farms of non-native trees. And JBS, the meat giant, promotes a net-zero plan that overlooks its massive methane emissions and contributes to the destruction of the Amazon.

To shine a light on this greenwashing, we've launched a video series that exposes these deceptive practices. Instead of relying on offsets, we're pushing for "real zero" – achieving genuine emission reductions by cutting emissions at the source, phasing out fossil fuels and industrial meat production, safeguarding people's rights, and transitioning to renewable energy and plant-rich diets.
