As temperatures shatter records across the globe, the urgency of the climate crisis has never been clearer. In Antarctica, we've seen temperatures soar 40°C above normal, while near the North Pole, they've risen 30°C above typical levels. These extremes are stark signals of rapid climate change, driving devastating impacts like heatwaves, wildfires, and floods that are already hitting communities worldwide.

This comes at a pivotal moment as the IPCC prepares to release its third working group report on mitigation on April 4. The report will examine progress on emission reductions, outline pathways that align with the Paris Agreement goals, explore social factors influencing consumption, and detail options across key sectors including energy, agriculture, transport, and industry.

We need a swift transition away from fossil fuels, grounded in the best available science. This is crucial as we head toward COP27 and the IPCC's Synthesis Report in October 2022.
