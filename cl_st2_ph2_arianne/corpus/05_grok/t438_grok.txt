Biodiversity loss is directly connected to heightened risks of infectious diseases spreading to humans. The COVID-19 pandemic serves as a stark example, illustrating how the destruction of ecosystems, widespread deforestation, and the trade in wildlife can bring people into closer contact with zoonotic threats—diseases that jump from animals to humans.

This challenge is inherently global, transcending national boundaries and demanding collaborative, cross-border solutions to address it effectively. One key approach is the Convention on Biological Diversity's "protect 30" proposal, which calls for safeguarding at least 30% of the world's land and oceans by 2030. This would be achieved by establishing sanctuaries to preserve these vital areas.

For such protections to succeed, it's essential to respect indigenous rights, promote women's empowerment, foster community engagement, and provide international support to frontline communities. These elements are crucial for implementing and maintaining effective conservation measures.
