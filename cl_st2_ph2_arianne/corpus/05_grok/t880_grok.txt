Greenpeace recently conducted a survey on smartphone habits across six countries: the USA, Germany, Russia, Mexico, South Korea, and China. The results revealed notable differences in repair practices, with higher rates in China at 66% and South Korea at 64%, compared to 28% in the US and 23% in Germany.

The manufacturing process for these devices often involves hazardous chemicals such as benzene and n-hexane, which pose significant health risks to workers and communities.

Encouragingly, four in five respondents expressed a strong preference for phones that avoid these harmful chemicals, are easy to repair—with support reaching up to 95% in China—and can be effectively recycled.

More than half of those surveyed believe that manufacturers are releasing too many new models too frequently and should take greater responsibility for recycling their products.

This rapid turnover contributes to a massive environmental burden, as smartphones generate nearly three million tonnes of e-waste each year.

At Greenpeace, we're calling on the industry to prioritize sustainable gadgets that last longer, are safer to produce, and easier to recycle. We invite you to get involved in our efforts to push for these changes.
