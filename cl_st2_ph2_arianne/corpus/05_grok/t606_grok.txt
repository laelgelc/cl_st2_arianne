In the heart of Brasília, Brazil, the 15th Free Land Camp brought together over 4,000 Indigenous Peoples in what stands as the world's largest mobilization of its kind. This powerful gathering was filled with music, dances, rituals, and the exchange of knowledge, all centered on advocating for Indigenous rights.

On the second day, Indigenous leaders made urgent demands for government protection of their lands, especially in the face of Bolsonaro's actions that have weakened environmental laws.

The event culminated in a traditional march, showcasing the strength of peaceful resistance.

Indigenous Peoples are on the frontlines, safeguarding forests from deforestation that worsens global extreme weather. It's crucial to support these guardians in their vital work.
