In 2021, amid the ongoing pandemic and escalating climate crisis, Greenpeace activists demonstrated remarkable courage through a series of bold actions around the world. In Spain, they blocked a fossil gas vessel to draw attention to the need for change. In Croatia, protesters highlighted the dangers of a sunken gas rig. In the US, efforts focused on urging a phase-out of fossil fuels, while in Vanuatu, women led demands for climate justice.

At COP26, Greenpeace joined protests that exposed greenwashing tactics, with global actions amplifying calls for bolder climate measures from leaders.

Additional initiatives included painting a plane in France to denounce greenwashing in the aviation industry, projecting messages onto a power plant in Germany, supporting Indigenous land demarcation in Brazil, and installing an "oligarchy monster" in Indonesia to symbolize systemic issues.

We extend our heartfelt thanks to all supporters who made these efforts possible. Images from these actions are available in our media library.
