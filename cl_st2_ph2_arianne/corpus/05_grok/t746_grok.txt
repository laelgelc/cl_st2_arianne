Rosatom's Akademik Lomonosov, the world's first floating nuclear power plant, is now being towed to the Arctic to power fossil fuel extraction. This development raises serious concerns about the risks it poses to the environment and safety in the region.

Among the potential dangers are seawater explosions, hydrogen blasts, and radioactive contamination that could affect marine wildlife and fish stocks. These risks are exacerbated by the harsh Arctic conditions.

Historical nuclear incidents on submarines and icebreakers highlight the potential for accidents, and the planned fleets of such plants could increase these risks further.

Nuclear waste from the plant will be stored onboard for years, with no secure land disposal available.

The Akademik Lomonosov operates without independent oversight and is vulnerable to tsunamis, cyclones, collisions, flooding, sinking, or grounding, any of which could lead to radiation leaks.
