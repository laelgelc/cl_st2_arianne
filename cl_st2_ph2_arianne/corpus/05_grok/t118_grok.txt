Europe's transport system, heavily reliant on fossil fuels, is fueling a cascade of crises that affect us all. From accelerating climate change to driving inflation and skyrocketing energy prices, it's also propping up conflicts funded by oil exports, such as Russia's invasion efforts. For households across the continent, the costs of this dependency are staggering, eating into budgets and livelihoods.

Transport alone accounts for about 30% of the EU's greenhouse gas emissions, making it a major contributor to the climate emergency. Beyond emissions, the extraction of oil causes widespread environmental destruction, while so-called solutions like agrofuels often prove to be false promises that fail to address the root problems.

It's time to drain the oil from our mobility systems. By shifting towards affordable public transport and active options like walking and cycling, we can build a cleaner, more equitable future. The goal is clear: fully decarbonize transport by 2040, steering clear of inefficient alternatives that only delay real progress.

To make this transition fair, we must end subsidies for polluters and provide strong support for workers affected by the shift, ensuring no one is left behind in the move to sustainable mobility.
