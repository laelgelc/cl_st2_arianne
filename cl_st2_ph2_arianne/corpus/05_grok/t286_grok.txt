In 2018, Greenpeace Malaysia campaigner Heng Kiah Chun met Pua Lay Peng, a chemist leading the grassroots group Persatuan Tindakan Alam Sekitar Kuala Langat in Jenjarom. This meeting took place amid pollution from imported plastic waste, following China's import ban. Pua mobilized community members—including drivers, lawyers, and housewives—to campaign for clean air and water. They organized meetings, fieldwork, reports, and complaints to authorities, which led to the closure of over 300 illegal facilities. Despite death threats, they expanded efforts to other areas and empowered communities. Pua advocated internationally in New Zealand and Brussels, and earned a 2019 civil society award.
