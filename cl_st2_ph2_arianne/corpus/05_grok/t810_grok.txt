With heavy hearts, we at Greenpeace Nordic confirm the tragic death of our colleague Carolina Nyberg-Steiser, 29, in a small amphibious plane crash while landing on the Rio Negro near Manaus, Brazil, on Tuesday at 11:50 AM local time. Carolina was visiting the Brazil office to meet colleagues, learn about the Amazon protection campaign, and witness the forest firsthand. The pilot and three other Greenpeace Brazil passengers survived with light injuries. No confirmed cause details are available. Out of respect for her family, further comments are withheld. Carolina is deeply missed, and our thoughts are with her family.
