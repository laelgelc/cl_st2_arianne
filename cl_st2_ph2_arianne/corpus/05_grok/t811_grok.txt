Greenpeace USA has evaluated 17 major producers of smartphones, tablets, and PCs, focusing on three key areas: transitioning to renewable energy, reducing resource consumption, and eliminating hazardous chemicals.

In the area of renewable energy transition, Apple leads with 100% renewable supply chains. However, Samsung and Huawei lag in reporting emissions.

For reducing resource consumption, Fairphone, Dell, and HP lead with durable, repairable designs to combat e-waste. But many companies still use PVC and BFRs.

The average grade across these companies was D+, with Fairphone scoring a B.

We urge the public to take action by tweeting companies like Samsung, Huawei, and Amazon to demand better practices. We're also sharing facts on the environmental impact of electronics and re-launching the Guide to Greener Electronics.
