Greenpeace activists aboard our ship, the Esperanza, recently completed a seven-day patrol in the Gulf of California. During this mission, we uncovered ten illegal gillnets near the Bay of San Felipe and observed boats actively fishing within the protected habitat of the vaquita porpoise.

The vaquita, the world's smallest porpoise, is on the brink of extinction. Population estimates have plummeted from 97 individuals to as few as 57, largely because of gillnets deployed to catch totoaba fish, which are highly valued in China.

Our team documented these illegal nets and reported them to authorities, resulting in their removal. We also took the opportunity to engage with local fishermen, discussing sustainable fishing practices that could help protect the vaquita and support their livelihoods.

A two-year ban on fishing in the area has been in place, but enforcement remains severely lacking—with just two officials tasked with monitoring an expansive 11,000 square kilometers. Without stronger action from the government, the vaquita could vanish by 2018.
