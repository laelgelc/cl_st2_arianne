Katarina Sevä, a Sámi reindeer herder, shares the challenges facing her family's traditional way of life. For centuries, her family has practiced forest reindeer herding, but this heritage is now under threat from extensive logging activities. The logging is diminishing essential grazing lands and depleting vital hanging lichen, which reindeer rely on for nourishment. As a result, the reindeer are developing poorer antlers, experiencing lower body weights, and showing changes in their behavior.

The state-owned company Sveaskog has abruptly ended long-standing consultations with the herders without providing any explanation. Despite this, Sveaskog continues to ignore objections from the community, proceeding with logging in key areas, including those that had been previously agreed upon for protection. Additionally, the company is constructing roads without sharing maps or details.

Demands to resume consultations and to preserve the forests have gone unmet. In response, there is a growing call to immediately halt all logging operations in the Muonio Sámi district until meaningful talks can restart, ensuring the survival of reindeer husbandry for future generations.
