Greenpeace East Asia's latest investigation has uncovered serious shortcomings in Bumble Bee tuna's efforts to maintain sustainability and human rights standards. Our findings show that the company's Trace My Catch tool, meant to provide transparency, is unreliable in practice.

Out of 119 vessels supplying Bumble Bee, we identified 13 that violated regulations and were listed on Taiwan's Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated (IUU) fishing list. These violations included shark finning and illegal fishing activities.

One Bumble Bee product was traced back to the Da Wang vessel, where a fisher tragically died following abuse. This incident resulted in indictments for forced labor and human trafficking. Fishers we interviewed described experiences of excessive overtime and withheld wages on such vessels.

Our report exposes how tainted seafood ends up on shelves in the US, directly contradicting Bumble Bee's own sustainability and human rights policies. We are calling for greater transparency in supply chains, especially as consumers increasingly support traceability in seafood sourcing.

Among those affected is migrant fisher Manny, who shared his account of witnessing the fatal abuse on the Da Wang and his ongoing pursuit of justice for the victims.
