As I reflect on COP26, my feelings are mixed. Profit-driven corporations and leaders continue to destroy ecosystems and threaten Indigenous lands. It's time for the Global North to acknowledge the harms of exploitative capitalism, while the Global South remains focused on prioritizing people over carbon offsets.

Yet, there is hope in the power of people. Indigenous activists and youth are confronting leaders, demanding climate, economic, and racial justice.

COP26 fell short: it failed to limit warming to 1.5C, deliver the promised $100 billion in finance, or fund loss and damage. Instead, it pushed unfair carbon trading that disadvantages the Global South.

We need stronger resistance to ensure that people and the planet are at the center of COP27.
