Nine years ago, major brands promised to end deforestation by 2020. But with just 200 days left until that deadline, forests continue to be destroyed, and an area the size of Spain remains at risk since the pledge was made.

Greenpeace surveyed over 50 companies about their progress. Few responded, and none demonstrated efforts to sever ties with deforestation-linked suppliers like Cargill, which won't meet the deadline.

In Brazil's Cerrado, nearly half the vegetation has been lost to soya and cattle farming, threatening indigenous communities.

Greenpeace activists disrupted the Consumer Goods Forum Summit to demand action amid a climate and wildlife emergency, urging companies to end deforestation and restore forests or face extinction.
