Samsung has committed to recycling its recalled Galaxy Note 7 phones. The company plans to refurbish unsold units, repurpose components such as cameras, and extract raw materials in an environmentally responsible way. This decision follows global Greenpeace campaigns that included petitions, online actions, and protests. Samsung will also join EU research aimed at developing eco-friendly methods for smartphone recycling.

These steps address broader issues in the electronics industry, including the wasteful production of short-lived devices, the generation of e-waste, the use of coal-powered factories, and hazardous chemicals that harm workers and the environment.

We urge IT firms to shift toward sustainable practices, such as creating repairable products and adopting closed-loop models powered by renewables.

Greenpeace will monitor Samsung's promises and score brands based on repairability.
