A recent UN FAO report has sparked controversy by asserting that meat, eggs, and milk deliver essential nutrients that are hard to get from plant-based foods, positioning them as crucial for health, particularly among vulnerable populations. This narrative closely mirrors messaging from the meat industry, raising questions about the report's influences.

Notably, the report underwent review by key livestock organizations, including the Global Dairy Platform and the International Meat Secretariat. Additionally, several of its authors have ties to the pro-meat Dublin Declaration, which further fuels concerns about the objectivity of the findings.

This stance stands in stark contrast to evidence from sources like the EAT-Lancet Commission and various nutrition bodies, which demonstrate that well-planned plant-based diets can fully satisfy nutritional requirements.

The tactics employed here by the meat industry echo those used by the fossil fuel sector, both working to minimize the perceived climate impacts of their products.
