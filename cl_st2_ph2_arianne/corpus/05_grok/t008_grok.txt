A recent report from the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has sparked controversy by claiming that meat, eggs, and milk offer essential nutrients that are hard to get from plant-based foods alone. According to the report, these animal products are crucial for maintaining health, particularly among vulnerable populations.

However, this messaging closely mirrors the narratives pushed by the meat industry. Concerns about the report's objectivity arise from its apparent influences, including involvement from livestock organizations such as the Global Dairy Platform and individuals who signed the pro-meat Dublin Declaration.

This stance stands in stark contrast to findings from sources like the EAT-Lancet Commission and various nutrition authorities, which emphasize that well-planned plant-based diets can fully meet nutritional needs.

The tactics employed by the meat industry here echo those used by the fossil fuel sector, which has long worked to downplay the climate and health consequences of their products.
