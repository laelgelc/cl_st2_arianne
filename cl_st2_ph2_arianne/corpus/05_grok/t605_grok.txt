Monsanto has faced serious accusations of fraudulently promoting its herbicide Roundup, which contains glyphosate, as safe, even as evidence emerged linking it to non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in farmers. One such case involved Tralee Snape, highlighting the health risks faced by those exposed to the product.

The company has been accused of relying on falsified lab tests conducted by firms like Craven Laboratories to support claims of safety. Further allegations include the manipulation of scientific data and ghostwriting favorable reviews to influence public and regulatory perceptions.

Monsanto is also said to have bullied scientists and agencies, including the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), which classified glyphosate as probably carcinogenic.

Court rulings have held the company accountable, awarding billions in damages to plaintiffs for negligence and cover-ups related to these practices.

Studies referenced in these cases have shown cancer risks associated with glyphosate exposure, as well as pesticide residues appearing in food supplies. Additional research points to a nutritional decline in crops treated with such herbicides.

These issues persist following Bayer's acquisition of Monsanto, which came amid mounting legal and financial liabilities from the ongoing lawsuits and controversies.
