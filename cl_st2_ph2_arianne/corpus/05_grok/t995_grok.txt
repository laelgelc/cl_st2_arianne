In July 2010, Greenpeace lost two of its founders, Jim Bohlen at age 84 and Dorothy Stowe at age 89. Their lives exemplified dedication to social change, leaving a lasting legacy in the environmental and peace movements.

Jim Bohlen's commitment to pacifism was profoundly influenced by the Hiroshima bombing. He later immigrated to Canada, where he helped establish the Don't Make a Wave Committee. This group organized Greenpeace's inaugural anti-nuclear voyage to Amchitka, marking the beginning of the organization's activism against nuclear testing.

Dorothy Stowe brought her experience as a social worker, union leader, and peace activist to the cause. She played a key role in building coalitions and hosted meetings that fostered collaboration among activists.

Greenpeace's roots trace back to Vancouver's unique cultural blend, shaped by U.S. immigrants, a mix of generations, and innovative media strategies. This environment nurtured the organization's early efforts, with core founding couples like Bohlen and Stowe at its heart.
