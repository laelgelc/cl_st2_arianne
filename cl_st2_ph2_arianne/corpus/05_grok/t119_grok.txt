Climate anxiety is a growing concern, especially among young people. A 2021 study found that 84% of young people are worried about climate change, and over 45% report that it impacts their daily lives.

To help cope with these feelings, several podcasts offer valuable insights and strategies. "Climate and You" by Domyo Burk explores emotions related to climate change and ways to stay engaged without falling into despair. "Climate Change and Happiness" by Panu Pihkala and Thomas Doherty encourages articulating fears and finding ways through them. "How to Save A Planet" provides energizing, humorous stories on climate action, such as Ayana Elizabeth Johnson's Venn diagram and episodes featuring Britt Wray. "Outrage + Optimism" balances justified outrage with optimism, with guests like David Attenborough and Luisa Neubauer discussing youth anxiety studies.
