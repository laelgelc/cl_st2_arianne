Primark has just become the 20th global clothing company to commit to Detox, with the goal of eliminating hazardous chemicals from clothes and waterways. This commitment highlights the importance of accountability, including monitoring progress and exposing greenwashing. Recent commitments also include Burberry, while leaders like Mango and H&M are advancing in their efforts. However, companies like Nike and Disney are lagging behind. It's time for brands like Disney and American Apparel to step up and commit to Detox.

The path forward involves five key steps: admit the problem, identify and replace chemicals like NPEs, disclose discharges via public systems, and screen to blacklist hazardous substances by 2019.
