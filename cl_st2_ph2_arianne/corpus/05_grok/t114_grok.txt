Fossil fuel-driven climate change is fueling unprecedented heat waves, wildfires, and droughts, turning them into the new normal unless we take urgent action. We've seen record-breaking temperatures, such as 53°C in Death Valley and 48°C in Tunisia, where the heat is damaging crops. Deadly heat has struck Spain, Canada, the UK, India, and other places, with marginalized communities bearing the brunt of these impacts.

Fossil fuel companies continue to put profits ahead of people and the planet. We need a just transition to renewable energy, learning from the rapid responses we saw during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Greenpeace is campaigning around the world to ban fossil fuel advertising, stop financing for fossil fuels, reject dirty deals, and protect forests. There's still time to achieve the 1.5°C goal set in the Paris Agreement.
