At Greenpeace, we've heard the concerns raised in the film Cowspiracy, and we want to set the record straight. We deny receiving any funding from the meat industry and affirm our completely independent stance.

Our campaigns actively target the environmental impacts of animal agriculture. This sector accounts for 18% of global greenhouse gas emissions and plays a significant role in Amazon deforestation. We focus our efforts on issues like cattle ranching, soya production for animal feed, and destructive fishing practices. These initiatives have led to key victories, such as Nike's decision to halt purchases of Amazon leather, the withdrawal of a World Bank loan, McDonald's reforms on soya sourcing, and improvements in tuna fishing practices.

While we promote veganism and encourage reduced meat consumption, our approach emphasizes systemic changes rather than mandating individual actions. We take into account cultural and accessibility factors, with a goal of achieving a 50% reduction in meat and dairy consumption by 2050.
