Today marks International Whale Shark Day, a time to celebrate these gentle giants of the ocean. They resemble a mix of whale and shark but pose no threat to humans. These magnificent creatures are found in tropical oceans, including places like the Maldives, Philippines, and Mexico. As the largest non-mammalian vertebrates, they feed mainly on plankton, gliding through the water with their docile nature.

Yet, despite this peaceful existence, whale sharks are hunted for their fins and meat, leaving them vulnerable to overfishing because of their slow breeding rates. Each one has unique patterns, much like fingerprints, which help in tracking them. The IUCN lists them as highly vulnerable, and although Indonesia has conservation laws in place, enforcement remains weak.

So, let's raise a glass to protecting these incredible animals and their ocean home.
