A recent report from iPES-Food provides a clear roadmap for transitioning from industrial agriculture to more sustainable, ecological farming practices. The current system, dominated by monocultures, heavily depends on toxic pesticides, fertilizers, and antibiotics. This approach causes significant environmental harm, including soil loss, pollution, and the decline of pollinators, all of which undermine long-term food security.

In contrast, agroecological farming has been successfully implemented around the world. It works in harmony with nature to boost resilience, increase biodiversity, and improve incomes for farmers.

However, several obstacles stand in the way of this shift. Corporate lobbying from pesticide and feed companies exerts strong influence. Privatized research often prioritizes industry interests over broader needs. Additionally, there are widespread misconceptions that industrial methods are essential for feeding the global population.

To overcome these challenges, the report calls for collaboration among governments, businesses, producers, and consumers to drive meaningful change.
