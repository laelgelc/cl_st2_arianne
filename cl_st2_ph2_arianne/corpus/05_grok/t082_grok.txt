At Greenpeace, we celebrate the incredible contributions of volunteers around the world who are at the heart of our efforts to protect the planet. These dedicated individuals organize demonstrations, engage in public speaking, and participate in non-violent direct actions to drive change.

Take Christina from Chile, who is deeply concerned about droughts and access to water. Then there's Korean actor Junghoe Kim, who is addressing the issue of plastic waste. Katerina from Greece is fighting against oil drilling, while Marcos from Argentina is tackling climate change and forest fires. Kely from Brazil focuses on Amazon deforestation, and Lu Chia-Ling from Taiwan advocates for marine conservation.

Through their stories, these volunteers share their personal experiences, what motivates them, and their hopes for broader environmental changes on a global scale. Their passion inspires countless others to join the movement and volunteer with us.
