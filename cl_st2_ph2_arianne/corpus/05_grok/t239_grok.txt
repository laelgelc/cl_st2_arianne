In the wake of COP26, it's clear that net-zero commitments and carbon offsets are often little more than greenwashing tactics. These approaches enable corporations and nations to keep polluting while buying credits, which frequently lead to the displacement of communities.

That's why we're advocating for "real zero"—a straightforward path that involves phasing out fossil fuels entirely, without relying on offsets, to achieve genuine climate action.

A recent Greenpeace poll of 2,681 respondents from over 60 countries reveals that while understanding of these terms is low, there's a strong preference for real zero. Specifically, 93.9% of respondents favored real zero over net-zero strategies that include offsets. Additionally, 81.1% opposed the use of offsets, and 97.8% expressed distrust in companies that depend on them.

The poll also highlights that public trust leans toward activists rather than governments and corporations. This underscores the need for immediate action following COP26.
