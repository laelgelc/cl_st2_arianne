As head of oceans at Greenpeace UK, Will McCallum has witnessed firsthand the devastating impacts of destructive industrial fishing in the Indian Ocean. This includes the tragic bycatch of dolphins, rays, and sharks, caught unintentionally in massive nets. At the same time, local fishing communities are struggling with rapidly declining fish stocks, which threaten their way of life.

While adopting a vegan lifestyle can contribute to planetary health by cutting down on fish consumption, it's not a complete answer to the ocean crisis. Billions of people around the world depend on the oceans for their food and livelihoods, making broader systemic changes essential.

That's why Greenpeace is pushing for a strong Global Ocean Treaty. This would safeguard 30% of the world's oceans by 2030, while ensuring sustainable management of the remaining areas. To fight back against industrial fishing, we're taking direct action: challenging major tuna companies, working to stop destructive bottom trawling, and standing up for the rights of small-scale fishers. Above all, we emphasize solidarity with vulnerable coastal communities who are on the front lines of this fight.
