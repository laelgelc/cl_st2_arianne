As the world turns its attention to Glasgow, the 26th UN Climate Summit, known as COP26, is underway from October 31 to November 12. This critical gathering brings together governments, NGOs, businesses, and Indigenous groups to drive decisive action on the climate crisis.

At Greenpeace, we're standing firmly with frontline communities who are hit hardest by climate impacts. We're calling on leaders to halt all new fossil fuel projects, cut emissions in half by 2030, and reject carbon offsets, which we see as nothing more than scams. High-emitting countries must step up with at least $100 billion each year to support adaptation and compensation in the most vulnerable nations.

We must be vigilant against carbon markets that could derail real progress. Instead, the focus has to be on genuine emission reductions. Coming on the heels of the Paris Agreement and the latest IPCC report, COP26 represents a pivotal moment. Greenpeace is there on the ground, pushing for the urgent changes our planet desperately needs.
