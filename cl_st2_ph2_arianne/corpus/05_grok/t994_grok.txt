Today, we remember Dorothy Stowe, a co-founder of Greenpeace, whose passing marks a moment to reflect on the extraordinary women who shaped our organization's beginnings and its bold early actions.

Among them was Marie Bohlen, who first suggested the daring idea of sailing into a nuclear test zone to protest U.S. bomb detonations. Dorothy Metcalfe played a crucial role by handling media relations and lobbying governments to amplify our message.

In the campaigns to protect whales, Linda Spong and Bobbi Hunter were at the forefront, participating in blockades that challenged whaling fleets directly.

Susi Newborn and Denise Bell took on the vital task of acquiring and preparing the Rainbow Warrior, our iconic ship that would carry Greenpeace's mission across the seas. The name Rainbow Warrior itself comes from a prophecy foretelling warriors from all peoples who would rise to protect the Earth.

During protests against French nuclear testing, Ann-Marie Horne and Mary Lornie captured critical documentation of the assaults carried out by French forces.

These women, through their courage and vision, laid the foundation for Greenpeace's ongoing fight for a greener, more peaceful planet.
