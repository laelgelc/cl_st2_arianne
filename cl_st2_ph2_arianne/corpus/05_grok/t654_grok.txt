At the global climate talks, Gender Day shines a spotlight on the powerful connection between feminism and environmentalism, presenting it as a vital pathway out of the climate crisis. Women, particularly those living in poverty, bear a disproportionate burden from climate change because of their reliance on natural resources and their limited participation in decision-making processes. To achieve a fair transition to clean energy, it's essential to incorporate gender perspectives, develop inclusive policies, and ensure women's active involvement. Building on last year's Gender Action Plan, which pushes these efforts forward, events at COP24 are actively supporting this initiative. Women are at the forefront of sustainable practices, effective resource management, and political leadership, all of which promote greater equality, stronger democracy, and enhanced community well-being within a system powered by renewable energy.
