In the fight against environmental degradation, there have been notable successes, such as the Montreal Protocol, which has played a key role in the recovery of the ozone layer. However, these achievements are overshadowed by the reality that overall progress remains insufficient in the face of escalating environmental crises.

The 2017 "World Scientists’ Warning to Humanity" underscores this urgency, building on a similar warning issued in 1992. Since then, critical indicators have shown alarming declines: freshwater availability has dropped by 26%, vertebrate fisheries have decreased by 6.4%, ocean dead zones have increased by 75%, forest cover has diminished by 2.8%, and vertebrate species abundance has fallen by 28.9%. Additionally, CO2 emissions have risen by 62% since 1960, human population has grown by 35%, and soil productivity has declined.

These trends echo historical warnings, from Malthus to modern scientific studies, calling for transformative changes. To address the crises, major actions are essential: expanding nature reserves, restoring ecosystems, reducing food waste and population growth, shifting to plant-based diets, divesting from fossil fuels, and revising economies to prioritize sustainability.
