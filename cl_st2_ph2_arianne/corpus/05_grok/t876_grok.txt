Today marks the International Day against Nuclear Tests, a reminder of the devastating legacy of more than 2000 nuclear tests conducted since 1945. These tests have left behind irreversible radiation contamination, inflicting generational harm on communities around the world. One stark example is the exiled Rongelapese community, displaced from their homes due to the fallout.

We must praise the courage of survivors who continue to fight back. In the Marshall Islands, people are pursuing legal action against nuclear states to hold them accountable. In Japan, the Hibakusha—survivors of the atomic bombings—are tirelessly campaigning against nuclear weapons.

As Bunny McDiarmid, I reflect on my own experience in 1985 aboard the Rainbow Warrior. We were relocating Rongelap residents affected by radiation when the ship was bombed by French agents, resulting in the tragic death of our photographer, Fernando Pereira.

Protests like these helped lead to the halting of nuclear testing in 1996. Yet recent revelations have exposed the severe fallout from tests in French Polynesia, and victims everywhere continue to struggle for compensation. It's time to push for a UN treaty to ban nuclear weapons once and for all.
