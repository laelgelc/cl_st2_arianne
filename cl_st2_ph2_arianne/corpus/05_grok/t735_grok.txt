Insurance companies are sounding the alarm on the risks posed by climate change, yet they persist in insuring and funding fossil fuel projects. They've poured over $600 billion into these companies, effectively propping up an industry that's driving environmental destruction.

Without the backing of insurance, many coal projects simply couldn't move forward. This support is enabling the development of around 1,500 planned new coal plants, which would boost global coal capacity by a staggering 42.7%.

There are signs of progress, though. Sixteen insurers have already divested $22 billion from coal investments. Leading firms such as AXA, Zurich, Allianz, and Swiss Re have taken steps to stop providing coverage for new coal ventures.

At Greenpeace, through our Unfriend Coal network, we're calling on insurers to fully divest from coal, end underwriting for new coal projects, and redirect their resources toward renewable energy. By shining a spotlight on the laggards, we're pushing for the urgent change needed to combat climate change.
