A major review has shed light on the severe impacts of tropical deforestation on agriculture worldwide. By disrupting temperature and rainfall patterns, deforestation leads to drier and warmer conditions that pose significant risks to food production, both locally and globally.

At the heart of this issue is the vital role forests play in driving the water cycle. Through evapotranspiration, forests provide essential cooling and moisture that help sustain rainfall patterns critical for ecosystems and agriculture.

Specific examples from the review illustrate these dangers. In the Amazon, soy yields are predicted to drop by 25% due to these changes. Deforestation in the Amazon or Central Africa could also reduce rainfall in the US Midwest, affecting crop production there. Meanwhile, the loss of the Congo basin is linked to intensified West African monsoons, bringing temperature rises of 2-4°C and rainfall reductions of up to 50%.

To protect climate regulation, biodiversity, and food security, it's essential to avoid further deforestation and prioritize forest restoration efforts.
