This month, the Greenpeace ship Arctic Sunrise is sailing through the Indian Ocean, on a mission to document and expose the serious threats facing our oceans. This vast region is home to an incredible array of wildlife and ecosystems, from majestic pygmy blue whales and gentle dugongs to vibrant, colorful coral reefs and the world's largest seagrass meadow. For millions of people living along the coasts and on islands, the ocean is essential—providing vital food sources and supporting their livelihoods. Yet, industrial fishing and the impacts of climate breakdown are rapidly depleting marine life, putting these precious resources at risk. It's time for governments around the world to step up and take decisive action to protect our oceans. Join us on this journey and be part of the change.
