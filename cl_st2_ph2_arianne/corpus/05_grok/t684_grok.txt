Today marks the UN International Day for the Total Elimination of Nuclear Weapons, a crucial reminder of the urgent need to rid the world of these catastrophic weapons. At the heart of this effort is the 2017 Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, which was adopted by 122 states and is set to enter into force in 2020 once it reaches 50 ratifications. Currently, it stands at 15 ratifications and 60 signatures, signaling a growing momentum toward a global ban.

This treaty aims to prohibit nuclear weapons entirely, much like the existing bans on biological and chemical weapons. Despite boycotts from nuclear-armed states, there is increasing global pressure to implement it and achieve a nuclear-free world.

Reflecting on the devastation in Hiroshima serves as a stark example of the indiscriminate harm caused by nuclear weapons. These weapons are not only obsolete in the face of modern threats but also come with rising expenditures, even as arsenals have been reduced. The risks of proliferation remain high, and the 1970 Non-Proliferation Treaty has yet to be fully realized.

It's time to redirect those funds toward human security and put an end to nuclear proliferation once and for all.
