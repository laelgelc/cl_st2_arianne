The Amazon rainforest is under unprecedented threat, with record levels of deforestation reaching 9,762 km² destroyed between August 2018 and July 2019. This marks a 30% increase from the previous period and represents the highest rate since 2008, according to data from Brazil's National Institute for Space Research (INPE).

President Bolsonaro's anti-environmental policies have significantly weakened protections for the forest. This includes a 22% cut in inspections by the environmental agency IBAMA and a 38% reduction in fire-fighting budgets. Amid raging fires in the region, the government dismissed INPE's director.

These actions have also led to violations of indigenous rights, as seen in the tragic murder of forest guardian Paulo Paulino Guajajara. Deforestation warnings have surged by 100% from August to October 2019.

Urgent action is essential to protect the Amazon. We must support forest guardians and reject beef and soya linked to deforestation.
