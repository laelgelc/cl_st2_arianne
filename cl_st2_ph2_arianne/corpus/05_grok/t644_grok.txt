At COP24, the dysfunction of global politics was on full display. Fifteen-year-old Greta Thunberg pointed out decades of failed pep-talks and rising emissions, even though warnings have been issued since 1979.

A youth coalition presented the "People’s Demands for Climate Justice," which urges keeping fossil fuels underground, ending subsidies, rejecting false solutions like techno-fixes, demanding climate reparations from rich nations, and halting corporate interference.

The notion of "green growth" is debunked as a delusion, with studies showing that economic growth is tied to increased resource use and emissions. Systemic change is needed by contracting growth to address ecological overshoot.
