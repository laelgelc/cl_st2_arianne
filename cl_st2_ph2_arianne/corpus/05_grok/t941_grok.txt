Greenpeace recently marked the 30th anniversary of the French government's bombing of our ship, the Rainbow Warrior, in Auckland. The attack involved limpet mines that sank the vessel and resulted in the death of photographer Fernando Pereira.

In recent interviews, agent Jean-Luc Kister issued an apology, confirming that the bombing was deliberate violence aimed at protests against French nuclear testing.

Jean-François Julliard of Greenpeace France noted that the bombing did not succeed in stopping the movement's courage.

Captain Pete Willcox accepted the apology but highlighted France's absence of official remorse, describing the act as state-sponsored terrorism and challenging assertions of incompetence in favor of indifference.
