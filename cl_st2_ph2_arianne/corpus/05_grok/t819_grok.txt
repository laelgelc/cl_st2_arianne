Greenpeace activists from 25 countries took bold action against Arctic oil drilling in Norway's Barents Sea. They entered the exclusion zone around Statoil’s Korpfjell well and attached a globe carrying global messages to the rig Songa Enabler, which halted operations. The Norwegian Coast Guard responded by arresting the activists, along with the crew and our ship, the Arctic Sunrise.

Norway ratified the Paris Agreement in 2016, yet the country has granted new oil licenses and started drilling in its northernmost site ever. Greenpeace Nordic and Nature and Youth are set to challenge this in court against Arctic Oil in November. We urge everyone to add their witness statements to the more than 350,000 already collected.
