Greenpeace Spain activists have taken bold action by installing a massive 12-meter train model right at Barcelona-El Prat airport. This eye-catching protest draws attention to the harmful impacts of the airline sector and the planned airport expansion, which threatens to damage vital wetlands and comes with a staggering cost of 1.7 million euros.

The installation serves as a powerful symbol of Europe's inadequate rail connectivity, pushing for a shift in priorities. Instead of pouring resources into polluting planes and cars, we need investments in trains that are accessible and affordable for everyone.

This action also shines a light on the downsides of low-cost tourism, which fuels environmental harm. To build a greener future, we're calling for concrete changes: the creation of 30 new cross-border rail connections by 2025, better compatibility between train systems, simpler access for bikes and pets on board, cuts to airline subsidies including taxes on kerosene, and an end to short-haul flights where viable train alternatives exist.

Join us in this fight by signing our petition and watching the video that captures these demands in action. Together, we can steer Europe toward sustainable travel.
