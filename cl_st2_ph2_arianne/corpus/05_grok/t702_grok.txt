Greenpeace offices around the world have been documenting a surge in extreme heatwaves hitting countries like Japan, Germany, Denmark, Switzerland, and Korea. In some places, these heatwaves have shattered records, pushing temperatures to unprecedented levels.

These intense heat events have fueled devastating forest fires across Russia, Greece, and California. The fires have impacted millions of people and resulted in tragic fatalities.

Meanwhile, flooding has intensified in southern France and India, bringing widespread disruption.

In the Philippines, a powerful storm has worsened the issue of plastic pollution. Waste has clogged drains and washed up on shores, compounding the environmental damage.

These events show how climate change knows no borders, affecting communities everywhere.

To address this, it's crucial to limit global warming to 1.5°C as outlined in the Paris Agreement. This requires curbing fossil fuels, stopping funding for coal and pipelines, and fostering collective action. By sharing images of these impacts, we can inspire people to pressure governments and corporations for change.
