The #MobilityForAll campaign, as part of European Mobility Week, highlights interviews with underrepresented communities who share their experiences with mobility in European cities. One such story comes from a mother in Romania, who recounts the difficulties of navigating the city with her baby and stroller. She faces absent ramps in buildings, high sidewalks filled with potholes, cars parked on sidewalks, inaccessible buses, and unsafe pedestrian paths. She dreams of child-friendly infrastructure that includes ramps, smooth sidewalks, and safe walkways. Despite her repeated demands for change, the lack of action led to her frustration and eventual move to the countryside. Through #MobilityForAll, the campaign calls for car-free city centers, improved public transport, shared mobility options, better infrastructure for cycling and walking, and more green spaces.
