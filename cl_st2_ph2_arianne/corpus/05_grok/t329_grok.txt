Nestled in the Indian Ocean, the Saya de Malha Bank forms part of the Mascarene Plateau, linking the islands of Seychelles, Mauritius, and Réunion. This remarkable area is home to a rich array of wildlife, from pygmy blue whales and sperm whales to flying fish and tuna. At its heart lies the world's largest seagrass meadow, which acts as a vital carbon sink by storing carbon and helping to slow climate breakdown. This meadow also sustains species such as dugongs and tiger sharks.

The Saya de Malha Bank is designated as an Ecologically and Biologically Significant Area, managed under shared governance by Seychelles and Mauritius, and includes international waters. During a recent expedition aboard Greenpeace's ship Arctic Sunrise, our team mapped the area's wildlife using binoculars, hydrophones, and eDNA collected from water samples.

Yet, the ocean faces immense pressures, including a 71% decline in shark populations due to bycatch. To protect places like this, we need ocean sanctuaries and a strong Global Ocean Treaty.
