The Arctic 30—Greenpeace activists, journalists, and crew—were arrested by Russia during a peaceful protest against Gazprom's Arctic oil platform. Global support for their release has surged, with families launching petitions, websites, and pickets to rally attention. This wave of solidarity includes Nobel laureates and leaders such as Angela Merkel and Hillary Clinton, alongside organizations that have sent 1.5 million emails and gathered a million signatures in their defense. The Netherlands has taken action by seeking their release through the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea.

These individuals stand as heroes in the tradition of non-violent resistance, facing Russia's overreaction and frivolous charges like piracy and hooliganism. Such responses may ultimately strengthen the climate movement by drawing greater awareness to the cause.
