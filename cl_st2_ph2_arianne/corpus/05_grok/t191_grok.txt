Our oceans are the unsung heroes in the fight against climate change, absorbing a staggering 90% of the excess heat trapped by human activities. They also take in nearly one-third of methane and CO2 emissions, helping to mitigate the worst effects of global warming. On top of that, oceans produce between 50% and 80% of the atmospheric oxygen we breathe, thanks in large part to marine phytoplankton such as Prochlorococcus, which outperforms even tropical forests in oxygen production.

Yet, these vital ecosystems are under severe threat from human actions. Overfishing depletes marine life, plastic pollution chokes waterways, and offshore oil and gas extraction disrupts habitats—all of which impair the oceans' ability to regulate our climate. As a result, ocean currents are altering, flood damages are increasing, and the frequency of El Niño events could double by the end of the century.

At Greenpeace, we're calling for urgent action to safeguard our seas. We demand a strong Global Ocean Treaty that protects at least 30% of the world's oceans by 2030. This must include bans on commercial whaling and fossil fuel extraction from the seabed, as well as measures to end illegal fishing and contamination.

Our ship, the Arctic Sunrise, is currently investigating the Argentine Sea to uncover threats and build the case for protection. And the movement is growing—nearly five million people have already signed our petition urging world leaders to prioritize ocean conservation.
