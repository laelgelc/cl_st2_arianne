We are deeply alarmed by the disappearance of Brazilian Indigenista Bruno Araújo Pereira and journalist Dom Phillips in the Amazon's Javari Valley. They went missing while documenting the region, and we fear for their safety.

We call on authorities to investigate immediately.

These increased dangers are attributed to Bolsonaro's government, which fosters illegal deforestation, fires, mining, leniency on crimes, sabotaged enforcement, and weakened environmental laws.

We commit to defending Indigenous rights.
