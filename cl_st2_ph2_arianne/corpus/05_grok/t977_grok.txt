Did you know that the wooden table in your home or the flooring in your office might come from illegal logging that's devastating some of the world's most vital forests? At Greenpeace, we're shining a light on how everyday wood surfaces may originate from illegal logging in the Democratic Republic of Congo's Congo Basin forests. There, rampant illegal practices are destroying environments and livelihoods.

We've traced a shipment of endangered Wengé wood that was felled illegally by Bakri Bois Corporation. It was transported via the Congo River to Antwerp, sold to Bois d’Afrique Mondiale, and processed at Danzer Group's Czech facility. That facility was recently disassociated from the Forest Stewardship Council for human rights violations.

The EU's 2013 Timber Regulation prohibits illegal timber, but enforcement is weak. That's why we're urging investigations and seizures to protect forests and communities.
