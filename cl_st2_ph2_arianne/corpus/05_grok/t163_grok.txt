As I sift through old photographs from my time as a Greenpeace photographer between 1974 and 1982, vivid memories of those early campaigns come flooding back. One image reminds me of the 1975 moment when we returned a Sisiutl flag to the Yalis Kwakwa̱ka̱ʼwakw community, a gesture of respect that echoed years later in 2015 when they presented us with a new one.

The photos from the 1975 whale campaign capture how it propelled Greenpeace onto the international stage, marking a turning point in our growth. That effort included acquiring the faster James Bay ship, which became crucial for our pursuits.

Another shot shows the frustration of our 1976 launch, held up by customs delays that tested our resolve before we could set out.

I recall the intensity of the 1979 confrontation over trophy hunting in Spatsizi Park, where we allied with First Nations communities to stand against it.

There's a picture from our 1975 stop at the Tasu mine, where we encountered auspicious signs that felt like omens for the work ahead.

And navigating the treacherous Yucluta Rapids during those voyages—those images still evoke the thrill and peril of steering through such challenging waters.
