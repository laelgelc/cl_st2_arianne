In São Gabriel da Cachoeira, Brazil's most Indigenous city, the Coping with COVID-19 Committee was formed by city hall, Indigenous organizations like FOIRN, FUNAI, ISA, DSEI, and the Army. This group implemented preventive measures to combat the pandemic, including communication in local languages, sanitary barriers, lockdown, and mandatory masks.

Despite challenges such as healthcare collapse and high mortality among vulnerable Indigenous peoples, Greenpeace and partners delivered tests, oxygen, PPE, food, and equipment. They also set up 12 field hospitals (UAPI) in the Rio Negro region for community-based treatment, aiding recoveries and preserving elders' knowledge amid minimal federal support.
