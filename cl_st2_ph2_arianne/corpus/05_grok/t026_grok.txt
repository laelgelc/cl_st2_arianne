Women stand at the forefront of resistance against various forms of oppression, as vividly demonstrated by the Iranian feminist uprising following the death of Jina Amini. This movement brought together diverse groups in widespread protests that demanded democratic values, facing severe regime violence in response. It has sparked global solidarity, rallying under the powerful slogan "Jin Jiyan Azadi," which translates to "Woman, Life, Freedom."

To drive transformative change against colonial, capitalist, and patriarchal systems, we must embrace intersectionality, build solidarity, and learn directly from the communities most affected.

Several eco-feminist movements illustrate this spirit of resistance. In India, the Chipko Movement saw women employing nonviolent tactics like hugging trees to prevent deforestation and protect their environment. In Argentina, the Ni Una Menos marches mobilized against femicides, creating spaces for intersectional solidarity among diverse groups. The ongoing protests in Iran further exemplify this, uniting people in a call for justice and freedom.
