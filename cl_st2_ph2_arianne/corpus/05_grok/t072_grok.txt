The first session of UN negotiations for a Global Plastics Treaty, known as INC-1, wrapped up in Uruguay on December 2, 2022. The discussions centered on procedural matters, while there were strong calls for binding rules to tackle the impacts of plastic pollution on human rights, biodiversity, and climate.

At Greenpeace, we were there to push for a robust treaty that addresses the full lifecycle of plastics, from production to disposal. This includes implementing global control measures to reduce production and phase out misleading approaches like chemical recycling.

We saw some encouraging signs during the session, such as heightened regional urgency, the formation of coalitions aimed at just transitions, and a focus on human rights objectives. However, progress was slowed by industry lobbying and procedural delays.

Looking ahead, the next session is expected to take place in Paris in May 2023, where we'll continue advocating for meaningful action against plastic pollution.
