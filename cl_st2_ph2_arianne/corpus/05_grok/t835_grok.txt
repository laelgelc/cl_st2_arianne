Aboard the Greenpeace ship Esperanza, I've been sailing through the nutrient-rich Atlantic waters off West Africa. Along the way, we've encountered incredible wildlife: whales, dolphins, pelicans, flying fish, gannets, and even bioluminescent plankton lighting up the night.

Our mission involves chasing illegal fishing vessels and witnessing the devastation caused by overfishing. Yet, in the midst of this, I find hope in the beauty of nature around us. We've seen coral reefs teeming with moray eels and lobsters, ecosystems nourished by upwellings, mangroves that serve as vital carbon sinks, and beaches that are crucial for endangered green sea turtles.

On remote islands, we've come across marine hippos and manatees, along with communities that live in symbiosis with nature. These places are vibrant, filled with colorful attire, pirogues gliding on the water, and the sounds of music.

To protect these wonders, I urge you to sign our petition for sustainable fisheries management.
