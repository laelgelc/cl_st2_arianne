Plastic pollution is a growing crisis, with the equivalent of a truckload of plastic entering our oceans every minute. This plastic breaks down into microplastics that harm marine life and contaminate our water and food supplies.

On Earth Day, activists took action around the world. In South Africa and six European countries, sand sculptures drew attention to the issue. River cleanups happened in Kenya's Nairobi River and the U.S.'s Anacostia River, where volunteers collected data on the brands responsible for the pollution.

More than a million people signed petitions calling for change. Volunteers worldwide pushed corporations to take responsibility, including by cleaning up sites like Malaysia's Batu Caves, engaging with supermarkets in Spain and the UK, educating communities in Senegal, and creating art installations in Mexico.
