The world is shifting away from fossil fuels toward renewable energy, but is this transition happening fast enough to prevent a climate catastrophe? 

Samsung Electronics, a major global player, currently uses only 1% renewable energy. The company has promised to announce a renewable energy strategy by August 2018, but this timeline feels painfully slow—especially when compared to how quickly Samsung recalled its faulty Note7 phones. 

In South Korea, the government has set a goal of 20% renewables by 2030, and the 2018 Winter Olympics will run on 100% renewable energy. Yet Samsung, a sponsor of the Olympics, is falling behind. 

A recent survey reveals that 85% of Koreans want companies to switch to 100% renewable energy. 

Samsung needs to step up and embrace renewables now to avoid ending up on the wrong side of history. Join us in calling on Samsung to #DoBiggerThings—sign the petition today.
