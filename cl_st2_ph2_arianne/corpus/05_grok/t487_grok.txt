Air pollution from fossil fuels is a public health emergency, causing 4.5 million deaths worldwide every year. While coal, oil, and car companies continue to profit, this crisis persists. Fossil fuels are also linked to climate change, and companies and governments are not taking sufficient action to address these issues.

But communities around the world are stepping up with inspiring examples of change. In 2019, crowdfunding efforts led to solar installations at seven hospitals in Thailand, helping to reduce fossil fuel use. In Jakarta, 31 citizens sued the government over air pollution, which prompted petitions and promises from the governor to improve air quality. In Belgium, a mother started an initiative to monitor air quality at schools, sparking nationwide street closures and influencing elections.

It's time to join these efforts. Sign petitions and organize events to push for cleaner air and a healthier planet.
