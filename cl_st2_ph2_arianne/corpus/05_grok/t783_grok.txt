For over a century, automobiles have dominated our streets and shaped urban life. In countries like the UK and the USA, along with many others, vehicle ownership remains high, reflecting this long-standing reliance on cars.

Yet, there's a noticeable shift happening, especially among young people. Rising costs are prompting them to turn to alternatives like bicycles, public transport, and trains. In Berlin, for instance, public transport is a favored choice. Copenhagen stands out with 62% of commutes done by cycling. In Lyon, cars entering the city have dropped by 20%, accompanied by growing bike hires. Meanwhile, London's car journeys have fallen by 25% since 1990.

Car-free days are gaining popularity as well, with events like Bogota's week-long initiative drawing attention.

Electric cars represent a positive step forward, but achieving true sustainability means investing in cycle lanes, offering diverse transport options, providing affordable clean mass transit, and ultimately reducing our reliance on cars.

Greenpeace's report, Freedom to Breathe: Rethinking Urban Transport, envisions this kind of future. It points out how cars are wasteful in terms of resources, spending 95% of their time idling, and taking up significant parking space—such as 14% of land in LA County. When cities provide these alternatives, people's travel habits begin to change.
