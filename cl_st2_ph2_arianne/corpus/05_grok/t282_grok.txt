On July 25, 2020, the Wakashio bulk carrier, operated by Mitsui OSK Lines (MOL) and fueled by BP, ran aground near Mauritius. This incident led to the leakage of nearly 1,000 tonnes of toxic oil into a pristine lagoon, causing devastation to fisheries, tourism, and ecosystems. The disaster resulted in the deaths of over 50 whales and dolphins, as well as three tugboat crew members. In response, locals took action to combat the spill using improvised means.

The Mauritian government sank part of the ship in a whale nursing ground, withheld information on the type of oil, the extent of ecological damage, and compensation details, and shielded the corporations involved.

The unregulated shipping and fossil fuel industries continue to contribute to ongoing emissions and such disasters. We urge support for youth activism and the implementation of stricter regulations, including designating sensitive sea areas.
