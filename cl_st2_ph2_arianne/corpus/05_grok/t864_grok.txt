Greenpeace has launched a petition urging Samsung to reuse or recycle materials from the 4.3 million recalled Galaxy Note7 phones. The story has gained global media attention, with over 25,000 signatures on the petition.

Samsung has acknowledged the concerns and is reviewing options to minimize environmental impact, but has not shared public plans.

To increase pressure, phone Samsung and ask about plans for the phones, recycling or reusing components, and announcement timelines if none exist. Share responses via #SaveTheGalaxy on social media to encourage rethinking of phone design, production, and material reuse.
