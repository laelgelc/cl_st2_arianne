Corporate power has a significant influence on governments and international human rights law. Greenpeace uses law to hold corporations accountable for their actions.

The zero draft of a proposed binding treaty on business and human rights represents progress since 1992, when no consensus existed on such matters.

The draft requires corporate due diligence. It extends liability to subsidiaries and suppliers. It allows lawsuits in multiple jurisdictions.

However, the limits apply only to transnational corporations. It lacks direct business obligations. It fails to define specific human rights or counter corporate privileges like ISDS.

States should address these shortcomings. Collective action is needed to advance global accountability.
