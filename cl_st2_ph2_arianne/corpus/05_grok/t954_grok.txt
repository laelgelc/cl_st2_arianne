The industrial food system is broken, relying heavily on chemicals that harm people, farmers, the planet, and animals. It's time for change, and individuals can drive it by choosing ecological, local, and seasonal food, shopping at farmers' markets, and eating less meat. These actions build a people-powered movement that pushes markets and governments toward supporting ecological farming.

Consider these stark "food fails": In 2007, 269 tonnes of pesticides were used globally every hour. One-third of all food produced worldwide is wasted, an amount that could feed 149 million people in Europe each year. Producing the meat and dairy for one person's annual consumption requires 403,000 liters of water.

Ecological farming puts people first, along with health and biodiversity, while blending science with local knowledge.
