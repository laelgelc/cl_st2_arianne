I recently journeyed to the Sungai Putri forest in Ketapang, Indonesia, where I witnessed firsthand the dangers posed by peatland drainage. Logging company PT MPK has been building canals that drain these peatlands, an activity that directly violates government sanctions imposed in 2017. This drainage process dries out the peatlands, making them highly susceptible to forest fires, much like the devastating fires that ravaged the region in 2015.

The impacts extend beyond the forest itself, severely affecting local communities. The drainage disrupts rice paddies and complicates water management, threatening the livelihoods of those who depend on these resources.

Sungai Putri is home to a rich array of wildlife, including an estimated 900 to 1,200 orangutans whose habitats are under threat from this ongoing loss. During my visit, I stopped at a rehabilitation center where the stark reality of potential extinction for these animals became even clearer.

Forests like Sungai Putri are essential for both human and animal life, providing irreplaceable benefits. It's crucial that communities and governments take action to protect them.
