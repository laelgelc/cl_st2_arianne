One year ago today, on June 1, President Trump announced the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris Climate Agreement—a miscalculation that isolated America from the global effort to combat climate change.

Yet, this setback stands in stark contrast to inspiring actions worldwide. In New Zealand, for instance, the government has banned new offshore oil and gas exploration, a victory propelled by relentless climate activism.

This momentum is part of a broader global movement. From crowdfunded solar projects lighting up Johannesburg to widespread opposition against pipelines and coal plants, people are taking a stand. Banks are divesting from fossil fuels, as is Norway's sovereign wealth fund, while voices everywhere are demanding climate justice.

Even with the U.S. exit, nearly 200 countries have reaffirmed their commitments to the Paris Agreement. Non-state actors are stepping up too: cities are pledging to transition to 100% renewable energy, and the World Bank has committed to ending financing for oil and gas projects.

As we approach the Global Climate Action Summit, it's time to join this unstoppable movement and push for bold transitions to clean energy.
