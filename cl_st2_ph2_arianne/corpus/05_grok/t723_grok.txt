Around the world, concerns are mounting about the risks posed by oil pipelines, which can lead to devastating spills that threaten clean water sources, wildlife, fragile ecosystems, and the communities that depend on them. Indigenous-led resistance has been at the forefront of efforts to stop several major projects, including the Kinder Morgan pipeline, which is now Canadian-owned, the Keystone XL pipeline, the Dakota Access Pipeline—currently facing a $900 million SLAPP lawsuit from Energy Transfer Partners (ETP)—Enbridge’s Line 3, and the Bayou Bridge Pipeline.

Statistics on spills reveal frequent incidents involving companies such as Kinder Morgan, TransCanada, Enbridge, and ETP, underscoring the ongoing dangers these operations present.

It's time to shift away from fossil fuels and toward renewable energy sources to protect our planet. The oil industry often resorts to tactics like lawsuits and intimidation to silence opposition, but these efforts are met with inspiring nonviolent actions. Communities are building Watch Houses, installing solar power systems, and engaging in civil disobedience to defend their lands and push back against these threats.
