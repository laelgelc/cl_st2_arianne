Greenpeace is heading to the Arctic to document and witness the yearly sea ice minimum, when ice reaches its smallest extent at the end of summer, potentially one of the lowest recorded this year. The trip aims to highlight climate breakdown's impacts on oceans and wildlife. Melting ice enables new shipping routes and industrial activities, exacerbating ocean threats. A study predicts the Arctic could be summer ice-free by 2035. We urge support for a Global Ocean Treaty to protect 30% of oceans by 2030 through a petition, and invite followers on Instagram.
