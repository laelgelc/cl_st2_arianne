In our Vital Ocean Voices series, we're highlighting inspiring stories from people around the world who are taking action to protect our oceans. Today, we share the story of 7-year-old Kylian from Mauritius, who made a big sacrifice by cutting his cherished long hair to help combat the Wakashio oil spill.

Kylian's family has a background in fishing and conservation, which influenced his passion for the environment. He visited the Ile Aux Aigrettes nature reserve, where he learned about the interconnectedness of wildlife, the ocean, and local livelihoods.

When the Wakashio ship ran aground, it spilled 1,000 tonnes of oil, harming marine life in the area. Motivated to help, Kylian donated his hair to be used in creating oil-absorbing barriers. He also made a motivational YouTube video, joined a protest, and wrote a story—all to inspire others, especially children, to take action in protecting the oceans.
