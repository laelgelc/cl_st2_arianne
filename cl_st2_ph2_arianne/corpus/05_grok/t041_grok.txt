Luchelle Feukeng dreams of a green Africa during Women’s Month, envisioning climate action empowering women. In South Africa, renewable energy ends load shedding, enabling female students to study safely. In Cameroon, women access clean forests and rivers, with Yaoundé free of plastic bottles for better health. In the DRC, canceling oil block sales protects forests, celebrated by Indigenous People. In Senegal, women regain fish supplies from oceans, ensuring family nutrition. In Kenya, amending a seed law allows farmers to share uncertified seeds, sparking nationwide celebrations. She hopes to advocate for this reality.
