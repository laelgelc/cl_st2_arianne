Oil companies like BP are pouring billions into new oil and gas drilling projects. If the fossil fuels from these projects are burned, they will push global warming beyond the Paris Agreement's 1.5ºC limit, intensifying climate disasters such as floods and wildfires.

These companies are banking on unrealistic solutions like carbon capture technologies and massive tree planting to offset their emissions. However, such large-scale tree planting could negatively impact food production and human rights.

This approach disregards warnings from the IPCC and IEA that these types of carbon removal methods are simply unfeasible at the scale needed.

The real path forward requires rapidly reducing emissions, halting all new fossil fuel developments, and phasing down existing production while redirecting those investments toward clean energy sources.
