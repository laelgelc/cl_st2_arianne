Protected areas have expanded massively since 1965, covering vast swaths of land and sea, yet biodiversity decline continues to accelerate, with losses mounting in both terrestrial and marine species. Authors Camilo Mora and Peter Sale highlight how these "paper parks" often fail to deliver real protection, undermined by poor management, rampant poaching, unchecked development, pervasive pollution, and the far-reaching impacts of global warming that ignore boundaries.

Ecosystems are dynamic and deeply interconnected, demanding systemic solutions that go far beyond isolated protections. This includes critical steps like limiting human population growth and curbing consumption patterns. Even with ongoing environmental efforts, biodiversity is plummeting at an alarming rate, calling for a fundamental shift to embrace nature's complexity and enforce broader, more effective changes.
