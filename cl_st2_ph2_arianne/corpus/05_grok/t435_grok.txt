Wichotsak Ronarongpairee, chairman of the Thai Sea Watch Association (TSWA), has seen firsthand how COVID-19 has affected small-scale fishers in southern Thailand. With markets closing, seafood prices dropping, and incomes vanishing, these communities have faced significant challenges.

In response, Ronarongpairee started a fund where donations of 150 THB allow people to purchase local seafood, which is then distributed to communities in need, such as the blind and medical staff. The initiative has raised nearly 60,000 THB so far, enabling the delivery of a ton of fish to over 500 care workers. Those who received the seafood have expressed their gratitude for the support.

Looking ahead, Ronarongpairee expects to see growth in direct online sales from fishers to consumers, providing access to fresh, traditionally caught seafood. Meanwhile, TSWA is planning another program to help the poor, homeless, and disabled.
