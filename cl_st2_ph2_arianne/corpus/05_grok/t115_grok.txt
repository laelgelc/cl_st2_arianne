In Kenya, smallholder farmers are taking a stand against unconstitutional laws that ban the sharing, exchanging, or selling of uncertified seeds. These laws impose harsh penalties, including up to two years in prison or a fine of KES 1,000,000, and they tilt the scales in favor of multinational corporations within a broken global food system.

Among those leading the charge is Nasike, who heads Greenpeace Africa's Seed is Sovereign campaign. This initiative aims to protect seed sovereignty and bolster the ongoing Kenyan court case.

Darcise Dolorès, a Cameroonian environmental law student and Greenpeace volunteer, is drawing lessons from the South African rooibos case to help safeguard access to Indigenous palm oil.

Meanwhile, Delwyn, a South African activist, coordinates Greenpeace volunteers and founded Food Connect Durban. This effort promotes local sustainable food practices and heirloom seed saving, connecting with broader global movements.
