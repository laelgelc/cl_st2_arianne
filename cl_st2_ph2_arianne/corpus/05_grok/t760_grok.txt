Greenpeace International's Executive Directors, Jennifer Morgan and Bunny McDiarmid, have shared their inspiration from the #MeToo movement, underscoring the importance of building robust systems and fostering an inclusive culture to create safe workplaces for everyone.

They point to the adoption of a global Integrity Package, which includes a Code of Conduct and complaint protocols. Offices are actively upgrading their processes and are set to implement annual reporting on complaints.

The focus is on cultivating a culture that promotes equity, empowerment, training, and diversity, ensuring access to trusted officers for support.

This effort is at the heart of Greenpeace's mission, connecting how we treat each other with our work to protect the planet, while recognizing that improvements are an ongoing process.
