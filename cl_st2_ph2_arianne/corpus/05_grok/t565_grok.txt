On 31 July, activists around the world, from the Philippines to New Zealand, took to the streets in a powerful display of unity. They placed posters and street art in public spaces across 25 cities, aiming to hold the oil industry accountable for the climate crisis.

This peaceful People vs. Oil solidarity action showcased striking images that depicted intensified forest fires, hurricanes, cyclones, rainfall, and extreme temperatures. The artwork boldly proclaimed that climate anxiety, breakdown, and grief are "proudly brought to you" by the fossil fuel industry.

Through these creative interventions, the action directly countered the misleading ads from oil companies. It included urgent calls to join the fight, announcing the end of the oil age.
