At Greenpeace, we stand firmly against corporate tactics that undermine justice for communities devastated by environmental pollution. The law firm Gibson Dunn & Crutcher has a troubling history of facing sanctions for fabricating evidence, lying, and engaging in legal misconduct, particularly when defending major corporations like Chevron.

In one glaring example, Gibson Dunn deployed SLAPP suits and RICO claims in a New York court presided over by Judge Lewis Kaplan. These actions targeted Ecuadorian victims of pollution, their lawyer Steven Donziger, and even the Ecuadorian judiciary itself. The case involved serious allegations of judicial bias, waived privileges, and the involvement of a bribed witness named Alberto Guerra, who later admitted to lying. Trial irregularities further marred the proceedings.

Despite Judge Kaplan's ruling against the victims, courts in other countries have disregarded it. Such SLAPP suits pose a significant threat to free speech, silencing those who dare to challenge powerful polluters.
