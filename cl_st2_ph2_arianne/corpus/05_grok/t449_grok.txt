In the face of crises like Covid-19 and climate change, we've seen how neoliberal policies have severely limited our options, leaving us trapped in systems that prioritize profit over people and the planet. It's time to push for relocalisation as a way to build resilient, sustainable supply chains that foster strength not through isolationism, but through true internationalism and solidarity among global communities.

Free trade, as it stands, has largely benefited corporations at the expense of workers, communities, and the environment, creating vulnerabilities that exacerbate these crises. We need to rethink trade rules entirely, putting human dignity, fair wages, and ecological sense at the forefront.

Tariffs can serve as valuable tools in this shift, helping to promote economic diversification and support just transitions. To make these changes truly accessible, they must be paired with supportive policies such as affordable housing and basic income, ensuring that everyone can participate in and benefit from a more equitable system.
