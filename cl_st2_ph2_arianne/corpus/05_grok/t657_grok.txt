Climate change is not just an environmental crisis—it's a profound human rights issue. At Greenpeace, we see the urgent need for Climate Justice, which involves using litigation to hold governments and corporations accountable for their roles in exacerbating global warming.

Consider the inspiring case of young Colombians who successfully won rights protections for the Amazon Basin through legal action. In the Philippines, an investigation is underway into carbon majors—major polluters responsible for significant emissions. Meanwhile, senior women in Switzerland are pursuing an ongoing lawsuit against their government's inadequate emissions reductions.

These efforts underscore how climate change causes widespread ecosystem damage, poses serious health threats, and violates fundamental human rights, including the rights to life, food, and safety. Vulnerable groups bear the brunt of these impacts, facing disproportionate harm.

At COP 24, UN experts called for rights-based approaches to address the climate emergency. To support such initiatives, Greenpeace offers the People’s Guide, a resource designed to help communities build strong climate cases centered on human rights.
