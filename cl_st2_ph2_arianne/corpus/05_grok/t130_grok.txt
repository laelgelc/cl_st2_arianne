An Unearthed investigation has uncovered that garment waste from brands such as Nike, Ralph Lauren, and Diesel is being burnt in brick kilns in Cambodia. This practice exposes workers to toxic fumes released from polyester materials.

The findings underscore the problems with fast fashion's linear model, which contributes to exploitation in the Global South. They also point to greenwashing by these brands, despite their claims of sustainability.

Greenpeace's previous campaigns have exposed issues like pollution and waste dumping in East Africa.

The COVID-19 pandemic has worsened worker insecurity in the industry, resulting in situations of debt bondage.

Additionally, the fashion industry wastes up to 50% of its materials because of tight production deadlines.

There are urgent calls for brands to adopt circular practices and focus on producing fewer, more durable clothes. Furthermore, EU regulations are needed to enforce transparency and put an end to exploitation.
