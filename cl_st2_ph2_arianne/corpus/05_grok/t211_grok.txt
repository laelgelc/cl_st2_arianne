Greenpeace Argentina, in collaboration with local organizations, has taken a bold step by filing a class action lawsuit and injunction against the Argentine State. The goal is to declare unconstitutional the resolutions that approved offshore oil exploration permits for companies such as ExxonMobil and Shell. These permits include seismic blasting activities off the coast of Buenos Aires.

Such projects infringe on constitutional rights to a healthy environment, cause harm to biodiversity, and worsen the climate crisis, while primarily benefiting corporations. Through this legal action, we're demanding the recognition of a stable climate as a fundamental human right. It also emphasizes the need to prioritize renewable energy sources over fossil fuels.

The lawsuit draws inspiration from successful climate litigations in countries like the Netherlands, Germany, France, and Brazil. Meanwhile, widespread protests have brought together thousands of people in support of this cause, with the aim of establishing a powerful precedent that safeguards the planet for future generations.
