In the Philippines, climate change is upending the traditional weather knowledge that farmers and fishers have relied on for generations. This disruption is putting food security and overall well-being at risk, as communities face more frequent typhoons, floods, and droughts. These challenges are made worse by widespread poverty and inadequate governance, leaving people even more vulnerable.

The concept of "resilience" often gets thrown around in discussions about adapting to these impacts, but it places an unfair burden on affected communities. It lets fossil fuel companies and governments off the hook, shifting responsibility away from those who have contributed most to the crisis.

Back in 2015, a petition was filed against major carbon-emitting companies, which paved the way for a groundbreaking human rights investigation in 2019. This effort underscores the push for accountability in the face of climate harms.

The latest IPCC report echoes these concerns, warning of intensifying climate risks and increased mortality rates in vulnerable regions. It emphasizes the urgent need for protecting ecosystems, implementing adaptation strategies, addressing loss and damage, and pursuing climate justice to keep global warming within 1.5°C.
