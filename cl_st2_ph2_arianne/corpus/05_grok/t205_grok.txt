The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is set to release the second part of its Sixth Assessment Report on February 28. This follows last August's stark "Code Red for Humanity" warning in the first part of the report.

The upcoming report will delve into the impacts of the climate crisis on humanity and ecosystems. It will examine vulnerabilities and ways to build resilience. Specific focus areas include coastal communities and the role of social justice in climate-resilient development. The report will also explore adaptation solutions to address unavoidable changes, such as warming and sea-level rise.

A third part of the assessment, scheduled for April, will address emissions cuts. This will be followed by a synthesis report in October. These reports are essential for informing discussions at COP27.

It is crucial to heed the warnings from scientists, especially as climate conditions have worsened since 2014, with record warm years underscoring the urgency.
