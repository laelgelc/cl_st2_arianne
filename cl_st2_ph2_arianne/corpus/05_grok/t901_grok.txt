Mike Fincken, who served as a judge in the #SaveTheArctic poster competition and is the captain of Greenpeace's Arctic Sunrise, has selected the winners: Anastasia (21, from Russia), Sara (18, from Spain), and Emile (20, from Canada). These winners will join him on a voyage to the Arctic.

He reviewed over 2000 entries submitted from 75 countries. Among his tweeted favorites were posters such as "Bear Walks into a Bar," one showing giraffes above rising seas, another depicting a fist throttling a polar bear, and a Life of Pi-inspired piece featuring Arctic animals.

The posters embodied "artivism," which involves fighting injustice through art. He urges everyone to use social media to amplify efforts to #SaveTheArctic.
