The Boreal Forest is one of the planet's lesser-known wonders, serving as its largest ecosystem and a massive carbon absorber. This vast forest spans across North America, Russia, Japan, and Scandinavia, playing a crucial role in maintaining our global climate.

Yet, the Canadian portion of this vital forest faces serious threats from Resolute Forest Products. The company has been logging in Indigenous territories without consent, which has led to the destruction of habitat for endangered woodland caribou. In 2013, Resolute even sued Greenpeace and its staff for $7 million in an attempt to silence efforts to expose these destructive practices.

It's time to take action. We need 100,000 people from around the world to #StandForForests and send a message to Resolute CEO Richard Garneau, shining a spotlight on this critical issue.
