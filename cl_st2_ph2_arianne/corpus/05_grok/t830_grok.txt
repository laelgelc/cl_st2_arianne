The Copenhagen Fashion Summit brings together major brands such as H&M, Zara, and Burberry to address sustainability in the fashion industry, with a key focus on circularity. This comes amid an industry generating €1.5 trillion in revenue, producing over a billion garments annually, and facing a projected 63% growth in production by 2030.

The environmental toll is staggering, including the use of 80 billion cubic meters of water, emissions exceeding a million tonnes of CO2, and the generation of 92 million tonnes of waste each year.

Yet, circularity alone falls short without addressing the need to reduce overall production volumes, given that unlimited growth cannot continue on a finite planet. Brands need to move away from fast fashion models, instead promoting clothes that are durable and repairable, while encouraging consumers to buy less. This shift is essential, rather than depending solely on consumer recycling or other superficial solutions that don't tackle the root issues.
