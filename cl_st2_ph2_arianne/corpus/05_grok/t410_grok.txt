As the climate crisis escalates, global fire seasons are intensifying, with rising temperatures drying out forests and fueling devastating blazes around the world.

In Siberia, extreme heat, oil spills from thawing permafrost, and unfought fires have scorched over 22 million hectares.

In Brazil, deliberate fires set for agriculture, worsened by Bolsonaro's policies, are threatening Indigenous Peoples.

In Argentina, fires in the Paraná Delta and Cordoba, set intentionally for farming and real estate, are being exacerbated by severe drought.

In California, massive blazes sparked by heatwaves and lightning are forcing evacuations, worsening air quality amid COVID-19, and disproportionately affecting Black, Brown, and Indigenous communities.

We must take bold local and global action to protect forests and people.
