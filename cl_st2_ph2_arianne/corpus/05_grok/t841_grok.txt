A recent UN report by Special Rapporteur Hilal Elver addresses pesticides as a global human rights concern, particularly how they harm the right to food. The report debunks the myth that pesticides are essential for feeding the world. It points out that the "Green Revolution" enriched corporations while contributing to food waste, hunger, climate change, biodiversity loss, and inequality.

As a sustainable alternative, the report highlights agroecology. It recommends establishing a binding treaty on hazardous pesticides, setting national reduction targets, and educating civil society on agroecology.

The report also criticizes corporations for double standards and unethical marketing. These corporations deny the harms of pesticides, including 200,000 annual poisoning deaths, and influence governments to obstruct reforms. Politicians must act to end this corporate influence.
