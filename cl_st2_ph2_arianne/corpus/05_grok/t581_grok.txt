In the midst of environmental crises, there's often confusion about the roles of individual actions and systemic change. It's crucial to recognize that both are essential and deeply interconnected. Personal efforts, such as switching to tote bags or cutting back on meat consumption, may not resolve global problems overnight. However, these steps can empower individuals, foster resilient communities, and spark inspiration in others—much like the actions of Rosa Parks and Greta Thunberg have done in their respective movements.

We should steer clear of shaming people for taking these small steps, while also pushing for escalation into collective efforts. This means demanding accountability from corporations and advocating for policy changes that drive real progress. Ultimately, systemic shifts in our mindsets and economies are necessary for our survival, blending personal courage with our wider responsibilities to the planet.
