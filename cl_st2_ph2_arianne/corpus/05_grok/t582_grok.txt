In the ongoing battle against climate misinformation, it's crucial to address the claims made by global heating denialists who insist that the current temperature rises are just typical fluctuations seen throughout the Holocene epoch. This narrative simply doesn't hold up under scrutiny. Instead, the evidence points clearly to anthropogenic carbon emissions as the driver of unprecedented warming that has shattered the trend lines established during the Holocene.

Human forcings on the climate system are now the largest in recorded history, dwarfing natural variations. These forcings are being amplified by positive feedbacks that intensify the heating effect. At the same time, humanity's ecological overshoot is undermining Earth's natural resilience, making the planet more vulnerable to these changes.

A key indicator is the surge in CO2 levels, which have reached 415 ppm at rates 100 to 1000 times faster than the averages observed during the Holocene. The inertia built into the climate system suggests that these levels will continue to rise, potentially triggering state shifts in the Earth's systems that are unlike anything seen in any prior era.
