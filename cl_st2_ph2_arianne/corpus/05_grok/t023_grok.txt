At Greenpeace, we're proud to celebrate the life and legacy of one of our co-founders, Robert Lorne Hunter (1941-2005), through the biography *Mr. Mindbomb*. Edited by his wife, Bobbi Hunter, this book brings together accounts from friends, family, and colleagues to paint a vivid picture of his journey.

The biography explores Hunter's early life, his career in journalism, and the pacifist influences that shaped him. It highlights his pivotal role in the formation of Greenpeace, including key campaigns against nuclear testing and whaling. These efforts employed innovative "mindbomb" tactics, designed to capture public attention and drive change.

Contributors share stories of Hunter's humility, humor, and the inspiration he provided in global ecology actions. After his time with Greenpeace, he continued his work as an ecology reporter, extending his impact on environmental awareness.

Hunter's enduring legacy is evident in his books, such as *2030: Thermageddon*, which continue to influence discussions on climate and ecology. Family reflections in the book touch on his passing and emphasize his spirit of positive change, reminding us of the ongoing fight for a better world.
