Forests play a crucial role in our planet's health by absorbing CO2 and releasing oxygen, yet they are under severe threat from alarming rates of deforestation. Between 1990 and 2005, an average of 14.5 million hectares were lost each year, which equates to the size of one football pitch disappearing every two seconds. This loss is compounded by additional issues like forest degradation and fragmentation.

Efforts to combat illegal timber trade are being hampered by China's apathy, even as the EU has been cooperating on this front since 2009. To make real progress, the EU needs to fully implement its FLEGT measures, exert influence on China, and tackle imports such as palm oil and soy, which are linked to agriculture driving 80% of deforestation.

In 2013, the European Commission recognized this critical issue and is now considering new policies aimed at achieving zero-deforestation supply chains by 2020. These efforts include supporting better governance, protecting indigenous rights, and providing funding for forest protection. However, there are ongoing concerns about incomplete enforcement in countries like Spain and the potential risks associated with premature FLEGT approvals.
