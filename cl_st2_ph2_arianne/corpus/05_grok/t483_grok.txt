In a major win for our oceans and climate, Equinor has abandoned its plans for oil drilling in Australia's Great Australian Bight. The company cited a lack of commercial viability as the reason, a decision that safeguards vital marine life and keeps over 800 million tonnes of carbon locked underground. This victory comes after relentless campaigns by local communities, Indigenous owners, and Greenpeace, proving that united action can stop risky fossil fuel projects in their tracks.

Over in New Zealand, another blow to the oil industry: OMV's offshore well turned up dry, with no oil discovered. This failure casts doubt on the sector's future in the region, especially against a backdrop of widespread protests and the government's ban on new exploration permits. It's a clear sign that the tide is turning against offshore drilling.

Meanwhile, in Canada, Teck Resources has pulled its application for what would have been the country's largest tar sands mine. The company acknowledged the economic and climate pressures at play, a move that supports Indigenous communities and protects the environment from further harm.

These developments highlight the power of people standing up for our planet and signal the ongoing decline of the oil industry. Together, we're building a fossil-free future.
