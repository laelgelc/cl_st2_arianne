Fossil fuel companies like Shell, Total, and Eni are using glossy ads and sponsorships filled with images of rainbows, happy cows, and wildlife to greenwash their image. Volunteers from Greenpeace and other groups have documented over 100 examples of these tactics in 40 European cities through the interactive #BanFossilAds map. This map allows anyone to upload photos and details to expose these manipulative strategies. Specific examples include sponsorships of cultural events by companies such as Acea, Lexus, Plenoil, and Endesa. Through these efforts, these companies aim to gain social acceptance and block climate action. Director Adam McKay advocates for banning such ads, similar to how cigarette ads have been banned. We urge everyone to use the map's toolkit, document these claims, and sign the European Citizens’ Initiative for a ban, which needs 1 million signatures.
