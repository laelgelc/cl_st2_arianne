In 2017, Wixárika leaders Vázquez and Agustín Torres were murdered in Mexico. They had been fighting to reclaim their ancestral lands from ranchers and drug cartels, all while facing government inaction.

These tragedies reflect broader global struggles faced by Indigenous peoples. In Brazil, the Guarani and Kaiowa communities endure violence from loggers. In Ecuador, tribes are suing Chevron over oil contamination. Meanwhile, in Argentina, the Wichi and Guarani have successfully campaigned alongside Greenpeace to stop deforestation for soy plantations.

Globalization has failed to bring benefits to Indigenous peoples. Instead, these communities play a crucial role in preserving biodiversity. As a 2015 statement from Indigenous leaders highlighted, the Earth is facing degradation.
