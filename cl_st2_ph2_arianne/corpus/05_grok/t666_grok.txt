On World Fisheries Day, we're shining a spotlight on small-scale fishing as a source of innovation and sustainability. These fishers are embracing low-impact practices and building direct connections with consumers through an emerging market that values the stories behind products and their links to the planet.

This growing community brings together fishers, restaurateurs, retailers, NGOs, and others. They're leveraging technologies such as peer-to-peer platforms, IoT, social media, and blockchain to promote fair seafood practices.

Even though these efforts represent a small part of a high-volume industry, they serve as a blueprint for a broader transition.

Today, Greenpeace is launching its Roadmap to Fair Fisheries, with a focus on Greece, Italy, and Spain, while also seeking connections worldwide. We stand in solidarity with movements pushing for alternative food systems and invite collaboration to advance this vision.
