The first UN meeting on a Global Ocean Treaty has just wrapped up, marking a crucial step toward protecting the high seas. These vast areas cover nearly half the planet and are under serious threat from industrial fishing, pollution, and climate change. We need a strong treaty finalized by 2020 to make ocean sanctuaries possible and safeguard marine life for future generations.

At Greenpeace, we're actively campaigning to counter industry lobbying that could weaken the treaty, and we're calling on the public to get involved in pushing for robust protections. An exciting opportunity lies ahead with the proposal to create an Antarctic Ocean Sanctuary, which has already gained support from nearly 2 million people worldwide.

Our actions during this process have included eye-catching protests featuring banners and inflatable turtles, as well as delivering origami creations to highlight the urgency. While some nations are stepping up with ambitious proposals, others are falling behind, underscoring the need for continued pressure to ensure a treaty that truly delivers for our oceans.
