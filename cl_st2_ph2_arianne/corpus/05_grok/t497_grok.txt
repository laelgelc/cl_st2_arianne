Australia is facing unprecedented bushfires that have devastated vast areas, displaced communities, and claimed lives. Yet, amid this crisis, misinformation has spread rapidly, falsely blaming the fires on arson or green policies instead of the real culprit: climate change.

Let's set the record straight. These fires erupted during Australia's hottest and driest year on record, creating extreme conditions that fueled their intensity and spread. The primary causes include dry lightning strikes and accidents, not widespread arson. In fact, only about 1% of the fires were deliberate.

This misinformation didn't arise by accident. A coordinated disinformation campaign, amplified by bots on social media, has pushed these false narratives to divert attention from the climate crisis.

Claims that environmentalists opposed necessary fire controls are also unfounded and have been debunked. Meanwhile, the impacts extend far beyond rural areas—city-dwellers have endured toxic haze that has blanketed urban centers, affecting health and daily life.

It's time to have an honest conversation about climate change, right now. Politicians' inaction on this issue is unacceptable, especially given Australia's significant role in global coal exports, which contribute to the very emissions driving these disasters. We must address the root causes to prevent future catastrophes.
