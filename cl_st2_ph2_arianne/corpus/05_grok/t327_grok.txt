Starbucks Korea has announced that it will phase out disposable cups in its cafes by 2025, representing a shift from the company's limited environmental efforts so far. At Greenpeace, we're calling on Starbucks to go further by accepting reusable cups globally, launching returnable cup programs in every country, and eliminating disposables worldwide by 2025.

Billions of throwaway cups contribute to major plastic pollution, and Starbucks alone distributes 6 billion of them each year. This change in Korea has been driven by the country's government policies, including a planned 2027 ban on disposables and a 2022 deposit system.

Starbucks paused the use of reusables due to COVID but has resumed them in some regions, though not in North America. This prompts our call for a global transition to reusables to address the ongoing issue.
