In 2015, seven million people came together to halt Shell's Arctic expansion. This victory was followed by the Paris climate agreement, which signaled a significant shift from fossil fuels toward sustainability and environmental protection.

Today, the urgency to protect the Arctic continues. The region is warming at twice the global rate, with record low January sea ice levels. This melting is enabling destructive trawling in the Barents Sea, putting habitats, bycatch, and entire ecosystems at risk, including coral reefs where 30-50% have been damaged in Norway.

Greenpeace investigations at the North Atlantic Seafood Forum have exposed companies like Havfisk ASA, Ocean Trawlers, and FIUN, which supply processors such as Espersen, High Liner Foods, and Findus, as well as retailers. These connections could be tainting supply chains with the destruction of the Arctic.
