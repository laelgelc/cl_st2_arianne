The Arctic is facing unprecedented threats from industrial activities like oil extraction and destructive fishing, and it's time to amplify the call for its protection. That's why we're thrilled about our International Poster Contest, which has already garnered over 2000 submissions from more than 40 countries. These creative entries not only raise awareness of these dangers but also celebrate the incredible diversity of Arctic species, urging politicians worldwide to take action and safeguard this vital region.

Adding to the momentum, three lucky winners will join us on an unforgettable journey to Svalbard, where they'll witness the Arctic's beauty firsthand alongside Greenpeace activists.

The inspiration doesn't stop there. In Barcelona, an Urban Art Festival brought together 35 artists from 8 countries to paint 600 meters of walls, each piece offering a unique interpretation of the Arctic's wonders and challenges.

As Albert Einstein once said, "Creativity is contagious, pass it on." If you're feeling inspired, there's still time to get involved—the contest ends on April 30.
