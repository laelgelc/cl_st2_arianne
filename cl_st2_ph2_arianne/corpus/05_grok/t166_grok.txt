Recent oil spills have struck multiple regions, including Thailand, Peru, Ecuador, and Nigeria, with a looming threat in Yemen. These incidents have led to widespread environmental devastation, the deaths of wildlife, and significant harm to local communities.

Oil plays a central role in fueling wars, conflicts, and the arms trade. For instance, Russia's military operations are funded by revenues from fossil fuels.

Amid these crises, major oil companies such as BP, Shell, and Exxon continue to profit. They engage in greenwashing tactics, even as oil remains toxic throughout its entire lifecycle—from extraction to use—and contributes heavily to climate change. The industry has a history of ignoring warnings and funding climate denial efforts.

It's time to call out these major firms as climate criminals. We must end our reliance on fossil fuels and transition to renewable energy sources. Additionally, air pollution from fossil fuels is responsible for killing millions of people each year.
