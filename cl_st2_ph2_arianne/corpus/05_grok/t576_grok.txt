Beach cleanups are a powerful way to tackle plastic pollution, but to make them truly effective, we need to hold companies accountable for the single-use plastics they produce, rather than just relying on changing consumer habits or improving waste management.

In September, Greenpeace Greece conducted a brand audit on Charakas beach, where volunteers gathered three truckloads of plastic waste and identified brands on 3000 items. When we revisited the beach in April, we found that significant amounts of plastic had returned, underscoring the urgent need to cut single-use plastics at the source by promoting refill and reuse systems.

We celebrate the global efforts of cleanups happening around the world, but real progress demands systemic change. That's why we're calling on everyone to audit brands and push for accountability using the Break Free From Plastic toolkit.
