Fast fashion is wreaking havoc on our planet, and it's time we rethink our shopping habits. As we mark the anniversary of the Rana Plaza collapse, which exposed the harsh realities faced by garment workers, consumers should avoid impulse buys and prioritize the human and environmental costs behind cheap clothing.

Donation and recycling programs, such as those run by H&M, often fall short. Only 1% of the clothing collected through these efforts actually gets turned into recycled fibers. Instead, consider upcycling 95% of your discarded items or simply holding onto old clothes to ride out trend cycles.

Designer Vivienne Westwood sums it up perfectly: "Buy less, choose well, make it last." This approach can help curb the industry's enormous resource demands, like the 7,000 liters of water needed to produce a single pair of jeans, not to mention the pollution from chemical dyeing processes.

The scale of the problem is staggering, with 80 billion garments produced annually worldwide, most of which end up in landfills. Fast fashion's rapid growth has driven consumption skyward—from an average of 34 items purchased per American in 1991 to 67 in 2007—fueling an unsustainable obsession with new trends.
