Six-year-old Lucas in Hong Kong suffers from allergic rhinitis, which causes nasal congestion, a runny nose, and daily nosebleeds. These symptoms are likely due to air pollution from heavy traffic near his apartment. His mother, Margret, wipes soot-covered windows multiple times daily and keeps them closed to try to reduce exposure.

To address the issue, they joined Greenpeace Hong Kong's Citizen Science Research. They installed tubes to collect NO2 samples, and the results revealed poor air quality in their area.

NO2 irritates mucous membranes and hinders respiratory development.

Last year, nine of 16 monitoring stations exceeded national standards.

The government must curb private car growth and electrify public transport to protect health.
