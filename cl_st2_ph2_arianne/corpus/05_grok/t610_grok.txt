Greenpeace, alongside over three million supporters, is actively campaigning to combat corporate plastic pollution, with a focus on major companies like Nestlé and Unilever. During a Global Week of Action, activists took bold steps by delivering symbolic plastic monsters directly to Nestlé's headquarters in Switzerland and to its offices around the world. These actions called for Nestlé to significantly reduce plastic production and to invest in reuse models that can help address the ongoing crisis.

Similar demonstrations targeted Unilever in the Netherlands, amplifying the message against excessive plastic use. To further underscore the global nature of the problem, Greenpeace ships carried pollution symbols from communities in Southeast Asia all the way to Europe, drawing attention to the severe impacts on local people and the natural environment.

Nestlé has recognized that recycling alone is not enough to solve the issue and has committed to reducing single-use plastics. However, Greenpeace is pushing for the company to provide transparent plans and set ambitious targets to truly bring an end to the plastic pollution crisis.
