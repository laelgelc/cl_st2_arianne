In my journey as a climate activist, I've often looked back on how it all started with the excitement of school strikes and chanting slogans in the streets—it felt like pure fun and energy. But over time, that initial thrill has given way to a more stressful reality, filled with navigating complex policies, managing volunteers, handling media responsibilities, and grappling with the deep anxiety that comes from confronting the fearsome impacts of climate change.

I sometimes find myself wondering if even accomplished figures in this space, like the landscape architect Kotchakorn Voraakhom, ever feel a sense of hopelessness amid it all. Yet, what stands out is the way we persist, pushing forward despite the mounting difficulties.

My approach has been shaped profoundly by my mother's problem-solving mindset, which has taught me to turn these challenges into opportunities. This perspective drives me to blend storytelling with advocacy, using tools like writing, film, and photography to amplify our message.

From the women in my life, I've drawn invaluable lessons: how to bounce back from those inevitable low points, how to keep going with a foundation of hope, and how to give credit where it's due for the achievements along the way.
