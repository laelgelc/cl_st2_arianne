As the world gathers for COP27, it's crucial that youth voices from the Middle East, Africa, and beyond are heard. This was emphasized by Greenpeace MENA campaigner Nouhad Awwad during the United for Climate Justice ship tour.

Over 400 youth climate leaders came together in Tunisia to strengthen the movement. Some of them are now sailing on the Rainbow Warrior in Egypt, advocating for Global South climate justice.

These regions are facing severe impacts, including droughts, floods, famine, desertification, and rising seas. At the same time, rich nations are failing to provide the needed financial support.

The tour is delivering messages of hope, solidarity, and solutions. It urges a transition from fossil fuels and climate justice to protect future generations.
