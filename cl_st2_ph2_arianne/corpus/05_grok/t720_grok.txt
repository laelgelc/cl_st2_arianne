Energy Transfer Partners (ETP) has shown a blatant disregard for Indigenous rights and environmental protections in its construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL). The company proceeded without obtaining consent from the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, bulldozed sacred sites, and ignored repeated government calls to halt the project.

ETP's response to opposition has been aggressive and overreaching. The company has employed excessive force against protesters, leading to arbitrary arrests. It has also pursued SLAPP suits against those who challenge it, including Greenpeace. Furthermore, ETP's ties to the private security firm TigerSwan involved the use of military-style tactics to monitor and suppress dissent.

Beyond these actions, ETP has pushed for anti-protest laws that stifle free speech and has seized property to advance its interests. The company's poor safety record is marked by frequent spills and substantial fines, highlighting ongoing risks to communities and ecosystems.

Greenpeace USA's report, "Too Far, Too Often," exposes these patterns and calls on banks to sever financial ties with ETP, given its persistent disregard for human rights.
