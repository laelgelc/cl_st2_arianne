Two hundred Brazilian civil society organizations, including Greenpeace Brazil, have sent a letter to the US government urging it not to support President Jair Bolsonaro's destructive environmental policies through secretive negotiations. These talks involve billions in US funds aimed at curbing Amazon deforestation. However, Bolsonaro's administration has weakened climate commitments to levels below those in the Paris Agreement, increased deforestation, harmed Indigenous Peoples, and failed to use existing funds such as the Amazon Fund. The letter warns that such a deal would legitimize anti-environmental actions and direct resources to large landowners, while undermining US climate leadership under President Biden.
