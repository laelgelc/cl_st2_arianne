In the wake of the devastating mining dam collapse in Brumadinho, Brazil, a catastrophic mudslide has claimed 60 confirmed lives and left over 290 people missing. Families are grappling with profound grief, sharing heart-wrenching stories of loss amid evacuations from surrounding areas. The fear persists, with warnings of a potential second dam failure heightening the anxiety for residents.

This tragedy, driven by mining greed, mirrors previous incidents and underscores the human cost of such negligence. The environmental toll is immense, as toxic sludge spreads up to 220 km, leaving dead fish in its path and threatening the Paraopeba River along with Indigenous lands.

Greenpeace activists are on the ground, documenting the unfolding tragedy, amplifying the voices of victims, and calling for justice through thorough investigations and reparations.
