As Covid restrictions ease around the world, it's the perfect time to rethink how we move through our cities in ways that protect the planet. With World Bicycle Day and World Environment Day upon us, let's embrace eco-friendly urban mobility and #ShareTheCity.

Instead of relying on short-haul flights or cars, choose trains for those journeys. Opt for shared electric vehicles when needed, and cut back on private car use overall. This simple shift reduces emissions and frees up space for people and nature to thrive.

We call on governments to prioritize walking, cycling, public transport, and green spaces in urban planning. At the community level, organize for car-free zones and safer infrastructure to make these options viable for everyone.

Through Greenpeace's #Mobility4All campaign, we're pushing for accessible, sustainable transport that benefits all. Biking, walking, and rail travel not only support health and social connections but also play a key role in environmental protection. Let's make our cities places where everyone can move freely and sustainably.
