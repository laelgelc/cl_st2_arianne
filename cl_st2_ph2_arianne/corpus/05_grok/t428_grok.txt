In 2020, a year marked by profound disruption, Lagi Toribau looks back on a global system that has proven broken, one that prioritizes competition, power, and inequality rather than collaboration and the value of human life. Rooted in his Fijian upbringing amid communal structures, he calls for a fundamental shift in mindset to drive real societal transformation.

He imagines a world free from biases, categorizations, and competition, where happiness and health serve as the universal currencies, and where humans coexist in harmony with nature. The COVID-19 pandemic has laid bare the vulnerabilities in our systems, pushing for broader definitions of security, greater equity, and stronger environmental protection.

Toribau also confronts systemic racism, drawing inspiration from the murder of George Floyd and the Black Lives Matter movement, and stresses the power of individual choices in advancing justice.
