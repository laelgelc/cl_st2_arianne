Tuna has been gaining popularity as an affordable and nutritious food option, with social media trends like #TinnedFishDateNight helping to boost its appeal. However, this rise comes with severe environmental and human costs that we at Greenpeace are deeply concerned about.

On distant-water fishing vessels, forced labor is a grim reality. Workers endure 20-hour workdays, poor nutrition, wage withholding, and passport confiscation. These issues have been exposed through Greenpeace investigations and reports such as Choppy Waters.

Environmentally, tuna stocks are overfished, with a third being fished unsustainably. High bycatch from methods like longlining and purse seining with fish aggregating devices (FADs) is harming marine life.

We urge consumers to choose sustainable options and to pressure governments for ethical fisheries management.
