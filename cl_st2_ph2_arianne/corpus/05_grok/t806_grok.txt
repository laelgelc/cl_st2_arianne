The GAIPE investigation into the 2016 murder of Berta Cáceres has uncovered disturbing details about the involvement of multiple parties in the crime. The report shows that DESA, the company responsible for the Agua Zarca dam project, along with the Honduran government and financing banks, were implicated in planning, executing, and covering up the murder, with activities beginning in November 2015.

According to the findings, DESA took aggressive steps to suppress opposition by deploying security personnel and hitmen, while also exerting influence over law enforcement to target Lenca activists who were protesting the dam. The Honduran government contributed by providing protection to DESA, refusing to grant security measures to Berta Cáceres, and directing state forces against those opposing the project. Meanwhile, the banks that financed the dam turned a blind eye to the ongoing repression.

The report also draws attention to the broader crisis facing environmental defenders, noting that 200 such individuals were murdered worldwide in 2016. It underscores the pattern of systemic attacks in Honduras and stresses the urgent need for justice in these cases.
