Nature lovers around the world are calling on outdoor brands Mammut and The North Face to remove hazardous PFCs from their gear. They highlight that PFC-free alternatives are available, promoting sustainability. As Greenpeace, we're urging these brands to detox immediately, in line with their values of loving nature. We invite everyone to take online action to demand products that don't pollute.

Recent protests have taken place in 13 countries to push for this change. The North Face has announced plans to phase out PFCs in apparel by 2020, though this doesn't cover other gear. Mammut states that it uses PFCs in a limited way and has phased out long-chain types. However, tests have shown PFCs in all their products, including long-chain varieties in some, and progress on PFC-free items remains slow.
