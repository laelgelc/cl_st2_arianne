As a mother, I often reflect on the profound joys and challenges that come with nurturing life. These personal experiences connect deeply to the broader suffering inflicted by climate change—devastation that leads to destruction, displacement, and the tragic loss of lives. Yet, amid this pain, I find hope in the resilience of communities that resist these injustices and in the African philosophy of Ubuntu, which reminds us of our interconnected humanity.

This hope fuels the urgent call for climate and environmental justice. Extractive companies and governments must cease their destructive practices, acknowledge their crimes, and compensate for the damages they've caused, particularly in low-income countries bearing the heaviest burdens.

My own childhood in Cameroon shapes this perspective. I remember playing freely in lush forests, but also enduring devastating floods and witnessing my mother's daily struggles. These memories underscore the harms of fossil fuel extraction, which displaces entire communities, ravages environments, and contributes to global climate impacts that now touch even Germany, where I live today.

I urge everyone to join the growing demand: fossil fuel companies must stop new projects and take responsibility for repairing the damages they've inflicted.
