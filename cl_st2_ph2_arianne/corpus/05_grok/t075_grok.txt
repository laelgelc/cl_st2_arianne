At the Rebuild Indonesia Youth Festival, Greenpeace hosted the "Dare to Dream" activity, engaging around 200 young people in visualizing a better future for Indonesia free from oligarchy, injustice, and environmental crises. Participants used MidJourney AI to input keywords such as clean cities, no pollution, green spaces, safe streets, and community, generating a diverse array of images. Artists were on hand to assist with refining these creations. The initiative sought to spark hope and imagination, fostering conversations on alternatives to infinite growth models, taxing oligarchs, and canceling GDP, while highlighting the vital role of youth in co-creating a sustainable world.
