On December 31, 2020, Mexico issued a presidential decree that prohibits transgenic corn and sets a phase-out of glyphosate by 2024. This move aims to achieve food sovereignty through sustainable agri-food systems that produce healthy, environmentally friendly food.

At Greenpeace Mexico, after 21 years of advocacy alongside various groups, we celebrate this decree as a major victory against GMOs and glyphosate. These substances pose health risks, contaminate ecosystems, and threaten agricultural diversity. The decree specifically bans glyphosate in government programs and prohibits GM corn in diets until sustainable alternatives are implemented.

Mexico, as the origin of 59 corn types and other crops, must advance ecological agriculture to protect biodiversity and heritage. The goal is a pesticide- and GMO-free system without seed privatization.
