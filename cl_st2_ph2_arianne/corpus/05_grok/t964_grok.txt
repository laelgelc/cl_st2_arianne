Reindeer, scientifically known as Rangifer tarandus and also called caribou, are remarkable creatures with a host of unique adaptations.

Their antlers grow annually and are as unique as fingerprints, covered in a warm layer of velvet during growth.

Reindeer milk stands out for its richness, containing 22% butterfat and 10% protein.

Their eyes undergo a seasonal color change, shifting from gold to blue.

These animals are speedy runners and remarkably energy-efficient. They're well-suited to cold environments thanks to hollow insulating hair, noses that warm incoming air, and footpads that change seasonally for better traction.

Males shed their antlers in December, whereas females keep theirs longer. The shed antlers serve as a source of minerals for other animals in the ecosystem.

Reindeer knees produce a clicking sound, and they have air sacs that allow for unique vocalizations.
