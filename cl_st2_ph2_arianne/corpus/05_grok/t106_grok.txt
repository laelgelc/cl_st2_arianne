In the coastal community of Cayar, Senegal, residents led by the Taxawu Cayar Collective have taken legal action against the TPM fishmeal factory. The lawsuit accuses the factory of polluting local water sources with toxic waste, which is putting jobs, food access, and public health at serious risk.

On October 6, 2022, evidence was presented in court, including laboratory results revealing toxic metals in the water and videos documenting illegal dumping by the factory.

A ruling in November 2022 dismissed the request for a temporary shutdown of the factory, but the community's efforts persist. By January 2023, the municipality had banned the discharge of wastewater into local waters, leading to additional litigation.

The fishmeal industry in the area processes more than 500,000 tonnes of fish each year, contributing to growing food insecurity. Local leaders and Greenpeace Africa have emphasized these impacts, underscoring the urgent need to address the environmental and social consequences.
