Polish climate activists, including at least five individuals over the age of 18, are facing accusations of violating environmental law due to their use of megaphones during Fridays for Future demonstrations. These protests took place at the December European Council summit, where the activists demanded higher EU targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 2030.

Underage participants in the demonstrations have been assigned special guardians. Some of these young activists have encountered police visits, court summons, and probation checks as a result of their involvement.

The activists have reported experiencing significant stress, uncertainty, and a sense of repression from these actions. They face potential severe consequences, including the possibility of being sent to reform school.

In response, the activists are planning to appeal to foreign embassies for support. They aim to draw attention to the high level of intimidation in Poland, which they connect to the country's dependency on coal and the deaths caused by air pollution.
