In the fight for environmental justice, brave defenders like Fikile Ntshangase, Berta Cáceres, Marielle Franco, and Nora Apique have paid the ultimate price. These women were murdered for standing up against exploitation and injustice, their voices silenced in a wave of violence that targets those protecting our planet.

This violence is escalating, particularly against women, girls, and gender minorities who resist environmental destruction. It's deeply connected to sexism and patriarchal systems that seek to suppress their efforts.

According to Global Witness, 227 environmental defenders were assassinated in 2020 alone. One-third of these killings targeted Indigenous people, and a staggering 95% of cases go unpunished with impunity.

While 90% of the victims are male, the violence directed at female defenders is on the rise, including horrific acts like rape and extortion. This surge occurs as climate impacts affect 85% of the world's population, exacerbating vulnerabilities.

We need an ecofeminist revolution to address these injustices. The Global North must be held accountable, and we must ensure protection for defenders as gender-based violence and environmental destruction remain inextricably linked.
