More than half of the world's population already lives in cities, and this figure is projected to reach 70% by 2050. As urban areas continue to grow, it's crucial that we prioritize people over cars to create healthier, more sustainable environments.

Cars bring a host of negative impacts to our cities: they generate noise and unpleasant smells, take up vast amounts of space, pose health risks through air pollution that kills 4.2 million people annually, and contribute significantly to climate harm. According to a Greenpeace report, we have only ten years left to phase out fossil fuel vehicles if we want to avert the worst effects of the climate crisis.

Imagine instead clean, connected, and community-focused cities that put people first. This vision offers numerous benefits, including reduced pollution—as seen in Paris during its 2015 car-free day, when nitrogen dioxide levels dropped by 40% and noise levels were cut in half. It also means more green spaces, infrastructure for active transport like walking and cycling, and investments in renewable public transit and electric car sharing systems, all of which can help cool urban areas and improve quality of life.
