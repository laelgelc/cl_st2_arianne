It's Penguin Awareness Day, and here at Greenpeace, we're celebrating by counting down our favorite Antarctic penguins. These incredible birds showcase remarkable adaptations to their harsh environment, but they need our help to thrive. That's why we're campaigning for an Antarctic Ocean Sanctuary to protect their home from threats like climate change and overfishing. Let's dive into the countdown!

Number 5: Chinstrap penguins. These birds appear squat and serious, resembling helmet-wearers.

Number 4: Macaroni penguins. They're monogamous crested cousins of Rockhoppers, nest on the Antarctic Peninsula and feed on krill.

Number 3: Gentoo penguins. They feature white head patches, brush-like tails, loud trumpeting calls, and swim at speeds up to 36 km/h, diving hundreds of times daily.

Number 2: Emperor penguins. As the largest, they dive deepest, use bubbles for hydrodynamics, and huddle as dads to protect eggs in winter.

Number 1: Adélie penguins. They top the list as tough, adorable rock-nest builders using pebbles for mating and society.

Join us in supporting the Antarctic Ocean Sanctuary to safeguard these amazing species for generations to come!
