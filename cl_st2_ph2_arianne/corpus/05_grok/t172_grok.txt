Fossil fuel companies are using advertisements and sponsorships to obstruct climate action, employing tactics that mirror those once used by the tobacco industry. This issue has prompted 450 scientists to call on advertising firms to sever ties with fossil fuel clients. The IPCC report has criticized corporate lobbying and advertising efforts, while also recommending regulatory measures to address them. Additionally, more than 500 academics are demanding that universities refuse research funding from fossil fuel companies as a way to counter greenwashing.

One stark example is Gazprom's sponsorship of football events, which continued even during the invasion of Ukraine. To combat this, Greenpeace, along with 36 other organizations, has launched a European Citizens’ Initiative aimed at banning fossil fuel ads in a manner similar to tobacco advertising restrictions. The initiative requires 1 million signatures by October 2022 to compel the European Union to discuss it. By achieving this, we can work to dismantle the fossil fuel industry's influence, protecting both peace and the climate.
