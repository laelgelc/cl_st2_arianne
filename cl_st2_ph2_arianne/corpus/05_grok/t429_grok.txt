Recent environmental crises in Russia highlight the urgent threats facing the Arctic and beyond. A major diesel spill in the Arctic has drawn widespread attention, compounded by climate-driven heating in the region fueled by fossil fuels, and increasingly intense wildfires ravaging Siberia.

At the center of the diesel spill is Norilsk Nickel, which exerts control over the affected area. The company has restricted access and information about the incident, while also blocking independent data on pollution levels. Satellite images have shown rivers turning unnatural colors, raising concerns that contaminants could reach the Arctic Ocean.

In response, Greenpeace teams and journalists gathered samples from the spill site, as well as from a separate incident involving wastewater dumping at the Talnakh factory. However, authorities at the company-owned airport intervened, seizing or blocking these efforts.

Such disasters underscore the need for greater transparency to effectively tackle environmental catastrophes and the broader impacts of climate change.
