In the heart of Brazil's Amazon, communities along the Rio Manicoré, home to around 4,000 people, have been battling for 16 years to create a Sustainable Development Reserve (RDS). Their goal is to safeguard the forests while allowing for sustainable use of resources. Recently, they've achieved a significant milestone by securing a collective use concession (CDRU) covering 3,899.32 km². However, for this concession to be effective, it must be properly implemented to stop land grabbing and other illegal activities.

This victory comes amid broader challenges in the Amazon, where over 500,000 km² of undesignated forests are under threat from deforestation driven by land grabbing, mining, logging, and ranching. These pressures have intensified due to anti-environmental policies under former President Bolsonaro, along with associated violence.

Greenpeace's "Amazon We Need" expedition is shining a spotlight on these resilient communities. Through this initiative, we're supporting research into the region's biodiversity and pushing for stronger forest protection measures, as well as the promotion of sustainable development models that benefit both people and the environment.
