Imagine your kitchen sink overflowing with water, flooding the floor and causing chaos. You could mop up the mess endlessly, but the real solution is to turn off the tap. That's exactly how we need to tackle plastic pollution: by shutting off the source. Companies like Nestlé are that tap, churning out 1.7 million tonnes of plastic packaging last year alone—a staggering 13% increase from the year before.

Plastic starts toxic from the moment it's made, seeping into our food, our bodies, and posing serious health risks. It's time for Nestlé to step up and lead the way by switching to refill and reuse systems, slashing single-use packaging, and saying no to false solutions like paper or bioplastics.

That's why Greenpeace activists showed up at Nestlé's Annual General Meeting to confront the company directly. Our Executive Director, Jennifer Morgan, called them out for their massive role in polluting oceans, harming wildlife, and devastating communities—facts laid bare in the Break Free From Plastic brand audit.
