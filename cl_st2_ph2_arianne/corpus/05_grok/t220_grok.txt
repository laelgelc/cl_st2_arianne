A new study by Greenpeace Russia and the University of Maryland highlights a dire threat to Earth's remaining wild forests. These Intact Forest Landscapes, or IFLs, are vast areas over 50,000 hectares without settlements or roads. Without urgent measures, most of them could vanish within the next 20 years.

Between 2000 and 2020, 12% of these forests were lost—an area equivalent to three times the size of Spain. Projections show that a third could be gone by 2050.

The climate crisis is worsening the situation, particularly in northern regions such as Russia, Canada, and Alaska, where extended fires and droughts are accelerating forest loss.

In Brazil's Amazon, rapid degradation is driven by industrial animal farming and land-grabbing, which are displacing Indigenous communities. Losses are also increasing in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Indonesia, and other parts of tropical South America. In contrast, Canada and the USA have seen reduced rates of loss.

These wild forests play crucial roles: they store carbon, house Indigenous cultures, provide habitats for wildlife, and help prevent erosion and floods.

To protect them, solutions include halting wood harvesting projects, ending industrial meat, dairy, soy, and palm oil production, avoiding fragmentation, recognizing Indigenous rights, and prioritizing people over corporate profits.
