Today marks the International Day of Awareness of Food Loss and Waste, a stark reminder that over 30% of global food is wasted even as hunger rises worldwide. In 2019, 690 million people were hungry, and the COVID-19 pandemic has worsened this through labor shortages, restricted access to food, and economic fragility.

This waste isn't just a loss of resources—it's tied to severe environmental harms, including deforestation, excessive water use, and contributing 8% of global emissions. The industrial food system, with its long supply chains and low prices, plays a key role in perpetuating this inefficiency.

To address it, individuals can take steps like meal planning and buying local produce. On a broader scale, systemic changes are needed, such as relocalizing food production, ensuring fair pricing, and shifting to ecological farming.

The upcoming 2021 UN Food System Summit offers a critical opportunity to transform the food system, advancing food justice and sovereignty for all.
