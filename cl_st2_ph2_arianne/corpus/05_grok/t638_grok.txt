Deep beneath the waters off Brazil lies the unique Amazon Reef, a vibrant ecosystem teeming with life. Similarly, along Australia's southern coast stretches the Great Southern Reef, another underwater wonder. These remarkable reefs share striking parallels, both nurturing an array of diverse species, from playful pink dolphins and elusive leafy sea dragons to majestic whales and curious sea lions.

Yet, these fragile habitats face serious threats from oil companies eager to exploit the surrounding areas. In Brazil, Total's application for a drilling license near the Amazon Reef was denied, a crucial step in safeguarding this biodiversity hotspot. Off Australia, Equinor's plans to drill in the Great Australian Bight have been delayed, thanks to strong community opposition and concerns over environmental risks, including potential oil spills that could devastate marine life.

At Greenpeace, we're rallying global defenders, scientists, and local communities to shield these ecosystems from the dangers of fossil fuels. Our campaigns push for a shift to clean energy alternatives, ensuring these reefs and their inhabitants thrive for generations. Join us in this vital movement—together, we can protect our oceans and build a sustainable future.
