Hurricane Lorenzo has made history by rapidly intensifying to a Category 5 storm in the northeastern Atlantic. This marks the first hurricane of such magnitude in that region, the strongest ever observed so far east, and one of the northernmost on record. Currently, it's transitioned into a post-tropical cyclone and is heading toward the British Isles.

This event aligns with a concerning trend of increasing Category 5 hurricanes between 2016 and 2019. Hurricanes develop over warm tropical waters, forming rotating systems of winds that can bring devastating impacts.

While global warming may not lead to more hurricanes overall, it can contribute to quicker intensification, increased rainfall, and slower movement of these storms. To address these challenges, it's crucial to accelerate toward zero emissions by 2040.
