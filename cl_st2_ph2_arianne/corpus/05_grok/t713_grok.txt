Greenpeace staff gathered in Helsinki recently, drawing inspiration from a documentation trip that highlighted both the breathtaking beauty and the heartbreaking devastation caused by logging in the Great Northern Forest. This immense forest stretches across Canada, Scandinavia, and Russia, encompassing nearly a quarter of the world's trees. It stores more carbon than tropical rainforests and provides a vital home for Indigenous peoples, including the Sami and Cree, as well as a wide array of wildlife.

Yet, only 3% of this critical ecosystem is protected. Logging activities are transforming vast areas into disposable products, which poses a severe risk: the forest could turn into a carbon bomb, exacerbating climate change.

That's why we're calling for urgent protection of the Great Northern Forest to help fight the climate crisis. To bring its wonders and threats closer to everyone, we're offering an AR app experience through Arilyn, allowing users to virtually explore this remarkable place.
