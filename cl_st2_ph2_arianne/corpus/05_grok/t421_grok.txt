Cabo Pulmo is a coral reef in Baja California Sur, Mexico, that hosts diverse marine life including fish, crustaceans, mollusks, birds, and mammals, many of which are at risk. Twenty-five years ago, the area was threatened by overfishing and irresponsible tourism. Local communities organized, which led to its declaration as a National Marine Park in 1995. As a result, fish populations rose over 400%, and migratory species such as whale sharks, mantas, humpback whales, turtles, and sharks returned. The communities shifted to ecotourism.

In 2008, Hansa Urbana's "Cabo Cortés" project threatened the area with pollution and habitat destruction. Campaigns with Greenpeace, including a petition with 220,000 signatures, led to the project's cancellation in 2012.
