In a world where food is produced in abundance, it's shocking that industrial agriculture is actually worsening hunger, health problems, and environmental destruction. This system is fueled by poverty, inequality, and the drive for corporate profits, leaving millions without access to nutritious meals.

Let's debunk some common myths about industrial farming. First, it doesn't end hunger because it views food primarily as a commodity for profit, not a basic human right. Instead of feeding people directly, it wastes resources: a staggering 26% of the world's agricultural land is dedicated to growing feed for livestock, which is highly inefficient. On top of that, industrial agriculture is a major climate culprit, responsible for 19% of global greenhouse gas emissions and driving 80% of deforestation worldwide. It also turns organic, pesticide-free food into an unaffordable luxury for many, while the heavy use of pesticides in conventional farming is linked to serious diseases, including cancer.

We need real change to build a sustainable food system. That means cutting back on meat consumption to free up land and resources, standing with Indigenous communities and small-scale farmers who often practice more sustainable methods, putting an immediate stop to deforestation, and holding our leaders accountable to regulate big corporations that prioritize profits over people and the planet.
