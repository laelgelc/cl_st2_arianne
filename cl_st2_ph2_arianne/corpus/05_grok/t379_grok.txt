Taiwan's coral reefs are a vibrant underwater wonder, hosting one-third of the world's coral species and drawing divers from around the globe. Yet these ecosystems are under severe threat from climate change and pollution, leading to repeated bleaching events in 2014, 2016, 2017, 2019, and again this year, all triggered by rising ocean temperatures.

Shrimp Roll, a former Greenpeace fundraiser who now works as a diving instructor on Green Island, has witnessed the devastation firsthand. He describes massive bleaching where the symbiotic algae that give corals their color and energy abandon them, leaving behind stark white skeletons. Recovery from such events is incredibly challenging for the corals.

Shrimp Roll also points out how winters have grown warmer, with temperatures now ranging from 23-24°C compared to the previous 19-20°C, exacerbating the stress on these marine habitats.

To safeguard these vital ecosystems, Shrimp Roll urges everyone to reduce trash, phase out fossil fuels, and support climate policies that can help protect our oceans.
