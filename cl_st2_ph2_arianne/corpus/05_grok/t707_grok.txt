Europe is currently grappling with catastrophic wildfires that stretch from the Mediterranean all the way to the Arctic, encompassing the vast Great Northern Forest that spans from Sweden to the Russian Far East. These fires are being triggered by climate change, particularly through extreme weather events such as heatwaves. In turn, the wildfires are worsening climate change by destroying essential forests and releasing significant emissions—up to 25% of annual CO2, along with black carbon that impacts the Arctic region.

In Russia alone, 12.6 million hectares have already burned, with 2.9 million hectares still actively ablaze. Meanwhile, Sweden is experiencing record-breaking fires across up to 60 different locations. The majority of these fires are caused by human activities, which highlights the need for greater caution. It's also crucial that these fire-related emissions be included in the Paris Agreement to address their global impact.
