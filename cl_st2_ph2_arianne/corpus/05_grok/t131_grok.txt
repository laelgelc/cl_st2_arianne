The UN General Assembly's resolution recognizing a clean, healthy, and sustainable environment as a universal human right came after more than a decade of global activism and litigation. This landmark decision builds directly on key cases, including Urgenda in the Netherlands, Klimaseniorinnen in Switzerland, and legal challenges against oil projects in Norway and the UK. It also connects to pending cases before the European Court of Human Rights, which involve Swiss seniors, Portuguese youth, and Norwegian applicants.

This resolution empowers groups that are particularly vulnerable to climate impacts and strengthens ongoing lawsuits around the world. Examples include actions against Shell in Africa and the East African Crude Oil Pipeline (EACOP) in East Africa. Overall, it supports broader efforts to hold polluters accountable, including through international courts like the International Court of Justice.
