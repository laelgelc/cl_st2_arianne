In a recent interview conducted by Greenpeace Japan, Hiroshima atomic bomb survivor Hiroshi Harada shared his personal experiences and ongoing efforts to educate the world about the devastating impact of nuclear weapons. At just 6 years old, Harada was at Hiroshima station when the bomb struck, forcing him to escape through flames and rubble alongside his father.

As the former director of the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum, Harada faced significant challenges in his mission to preserve history. This included attempting to loan artifacts to a U.S. exhibition, which was ultimately cancelled due to resistance. He also worked to secure UNESCO status for the Genbaku Dome, overcoming opposition from America and China.

Harada emphasizes the critical need to preserve and connect the fading memories of survivors, ensuring that the horrors of nuclear weapons are conveyed to future generations to prevent their use ever again.
