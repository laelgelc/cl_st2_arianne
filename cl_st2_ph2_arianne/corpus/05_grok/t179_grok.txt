Indigenous Peoples in Brazil are demanding an end to Amazon destruction and violence against forest guardians. At the 18th Free Land Camp in Brasilia, over 5,000 leaders from 120 groups have gathered for 10 days of non-violent protests under the theme "Retaking Brazil: Demarcating Territories and Indigenize the Politics." They are calling for immediate land demarcation and addressing issues like health and education. The participants are denouncing threats including deforestation, mining expansion via bills like PL 191/2020, and the #PacotedaDestruição. A petition with 517,000 signatures, symbolized by a totem pole with ribbons, was delivered to the Ministry of Justice amid rising murders and invasions, as per CIMI data.
