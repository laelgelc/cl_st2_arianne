Sophie Allain here, sharing an update on our ongoing fight for climate justice in Norway. For the past three years, Greenpeace has been in court alongside the Norwegian youth group Natur og Ungdom, challenging Arctic oil drilling licenses. Our argument is that these licenses violate constitutional rights to a healthy environment for future generations.

We recently faced a setback in the Court of Appeal, where we lost the case overall. However, we secured some crucial victories: the court recognized Norway's responsibility for emissions from oil that's exported and burned abroad, and it confirmed the protections offered by Article 112 of the Norwegian Constitution.

Despite these wins, the court ultimately ruled that the licenses don't conflict with Article 112, which has led us to appeal to the Supreme Court. This case underscores the stark tension in Norway between its proclaimed green ideals and its reliance on a massive oil economy. It's part of a broader global wave of climate litigation and growing activism pushing back against fossil fuels.
