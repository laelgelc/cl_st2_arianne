Greenpeace is calling for a global day of action on June 3 to oppose deep sea mining. This comes ahead of governments' meeting at the International Seabed Authority in Jamaica. We're urging people to join events, which can be found via a provided map.

Just as preventing offshore oil drilling has helped avert climate crises, we must act now to stop deep sea mining. There has been a failure to agree on ocean protection, which leaves the door open for the industry this year. Stopping it is essential to safeguard ecosystems, combat neocolonialism, and counter greenwashing.

The risks are significant, including the loss of deep sea species, disturbed carbon sinks, and impacts on Pacific communities. We encourage everyone to share a video and to use World Oceans Day on June 8 to build on the momentum from the Global Ocean Treaty against mining.
