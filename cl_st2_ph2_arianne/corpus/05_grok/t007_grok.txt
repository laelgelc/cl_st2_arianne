The ocean's depths hold mysteries and life forms we've only begun to understand, but they're under threat from deep sea mining—a destructive industry that could plunder the seabed and cause irreversible harm. That's why Greenpeace is calling for a global day of action on June 3, just ahead of the International Seabed Authority's crucial meeting in Jamaica, where decisions could greenlight this activity.

We're urging people everywhere to join events and stand up against deep sea mining before it even starts. Check out our interactive map to find or organize actions near you, and demand that governments halt this threat. It's similar to how we've fought to prevent offshore oil drilling, avoiding climate crises and devastating spills.

If no agreement is reached to stop it, deep sea mining risks endangering unique deep sea species, vital carbon sinks that help combat climate change, and the cultural connections Pacific communities have with the ocean. This fight is also about resisting neocolonialism and exposing greenwashing tactics that mask environmental destruction.

Share our video to spread the word and amplify the call. This day of action ties into World Oceans Day on June 8, and it builds on the momentum from the new Global Ocean Treaty, which aims for broader protection of our seas. Together, we can protect the deep sea for future generations.
