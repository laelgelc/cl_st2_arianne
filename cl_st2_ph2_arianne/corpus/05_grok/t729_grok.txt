Single-use plastics are wreaking havoc on our oceans, marine life, drinking water, and food chains, with the equivalent of a truckload of plastic entering the oceans every minute.

Major brands like Coca-Cola and Unilever have inadequate plans that focus on recycling instead of reducing production, even though over 90% of plastic isn't recycled.

Community-led efforts are making a difference, including bans in Mexico and Scotland, and cup discounts in Greece.

Join the Plastic-Free Future Facebook group, conduct brand audits, post photos of polluting plastic with #IsThisYours?, and use the Million Acts of Blue toolkit for local campaigns.
