Last weekend, I had the incredible opportunity to join Amsterdam's largest Pride Walk as a Greenpeace campaigner. Marching alongside Queers4Climate NL, Extinction Rebellion, and fellow Greenpeace activists, we showed our solidarity for LGBTQIA+ rights in the face of the escalating climate crisis.

Pride isn't just a party—it's a powerful protest. It's a reminder that we're fighting for equality and justice, especially as climate disasters hit LGBTQIA+ communities hardest. These events increase risks of homelessness and fuel hate against marginalized groups. In Fiji, for instance, cyclones have been wrongly blamed on sodomy, exacerbating discrimination.

At Greenpeace, we're committed to building a just and diverse society. That's why we stand against polluters who try to greenwash their destructive actions. If you're an LGBTQIA+ climate activist, we invite you to join us—our movement is stronger when it's inclusive and welcoming to all.
