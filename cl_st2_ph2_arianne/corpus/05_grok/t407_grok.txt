In the remote Waruá community near São Gabriel da Cachoeira, Brazil, the Dâw Indigenous People, a group of about 140 individuals, encountered a severe outbreak of COVID-19. After isolating themselves in the forest for a month in an effort to avoid the virus, the community still experienced near-total infection, with some visits to town contributing to the spread.

Most community members displayed symptoms, though limited testing was available to confirm cases. Fortunately, no deaths have been reported. Recovery efforts included the use of traditional herbal teas, along with medical support from the DSEI (Special Indigenous Health District) and the provision of hygiene supplies.

Community leaders have voiced deep concerns about the risk of extinction, drawing parallels to devastating epidemics in their past. They are advocating for comprehensive testing and enhanced healthcare services to protect their people. These challenges unfold alongside the Dâw's ongoing initiatives to revitalize their culture and language.
