As the COVID-19 crisis unfolds alongside economic shocks, we must prevent public funds from supporting industries that destroy the planet. Instead, let's direct those resources toward a just transition that prioritizes human well-being and planetary health.

It's time to hold our leaders accountable and stay vigilant against any attempts to exploit workers through the "shock doctrine." We advocate for a future that's cooperative and egalitarian, one in harmony with nature.

In this moment of solidarity to combat the virus, we reject blame and division. Let's build alliances and view the pandemic as an opportunity to learn crucial lessons, address systemic issues, and protect vulnerable people with compassion, courage, and cooperation.

Greenpeace members are sharing their personal challenges during this time, inspiring us all with acts of solidarity. As we navigate this crisis, we stress the importance of self-care while remaining vigilant.
