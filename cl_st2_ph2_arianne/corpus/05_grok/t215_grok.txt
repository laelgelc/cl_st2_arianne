At Greenpeace, we're always shining a light on the behind-the-scenes work that powers our volunteer initiatives. Today, we're diving into the development of a data dashboard designed specifically for our Open Social platforms.

Back in 2018, our community voiced a need for better tracking of site content, user types, and actions. This led to the creation of a webhook-based solution that integrates seamlessly with Google Tag Manager and Analytics.

We piloted this dashboard in Brazil, where it visualizes data to help us understand our users and enhance mobilization efforts.

Now, it's in use by 10 Greenpeace organizations spanning 17 countries, enabling us to engage 50,000 volunteers in safe, ad-free spaces.

As an open-source tool, it's available for other non-profits to adopt and adapt.

We're actively seeking feedback to guide future iterations, and we're excited about the upcoming GreenAct app that will build on this foundation.
