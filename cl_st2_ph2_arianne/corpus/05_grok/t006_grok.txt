In the face of escalating climate crises, LGBTQIA2S+ individuals often bear a disproportionate burden of discrimination and environmental impacts. This reality underscores the deep interconnectedness between queer rights and climate justice movements, calling for unified collective action to address these overlapping challenges.

Higher rates of homelessness among LGBTQIA2S+ people, particularly those who are Black, Indigenous, or People of Color (BIPOC), frequently force them into living in polluted or disaster-prone areas. These circumstances create significant barriers to accessing aid during emergencies, amplifying vulnerabilities.

Specific instances highlight these injustices: during Hurricane Katrina, trans individuals were denied entry to shelters or even jailed. Similarly, after the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, Aravanis were excluded from relief efforts.
