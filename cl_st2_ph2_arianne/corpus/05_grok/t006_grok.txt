Climate crises don't affect everyone equally, and LGBTQIA2S+ individuals often face disproportionate discrimination that worsens inequalities in housing, healthcare, and access to resources. This reality underscores the deep interconnectedness between queer and climate movements, calling for unity to protect both people and the planet. At Greenpeace, we stress the importance of fighting for all, and it's worth noting that the rainbow flag includes green to represent nature.

Key challenges include significantly higher homelessness rates among LGBTQIA2S+ people. In the US, they face a 120% increased risk of homelessness, with LGBTQIA2S+ youth making up 40% of the homeless youth population—a situation that's even more severe for Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC). These communities are also more vulnerable to pollution and disasters.

Specific examples highlight these injustices. During Hurricane Katrina, trans people were denied access to shelters, and in one case, a trans individual was even jailed. After the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, Aravanis were excluded from aid efforts.
