This January, the World Economic Forum's Davos meeting has gone virtual due to COVID, with the in-person event shifting to Singapore in May, a move that underscores ongoing geopolitical changes. Meanwhile, billionaires such as Jeff Bezos have seen immense profits during the crisis, sparking widespread calls for a green and just recovery that addresses inequality and climate change.

At Greenpeace, we're championing radical policies around the globe to drive this change, from supporting a Wealth Tax in Canada and a New Normal in the Philippines, to pushing for dividend bans in France on companies that fail to act on climate, and advocating green recovery proposals in India, the US, Spain, and New Zealand.

Global polls reflect strong public support for such transformational shifts. We're actively backing campaigns like Make Amazon Pay and calling for a #PeoplesVaccine to ensure equitable access.

We encourage everyone to join #BetterThanDavos actions, demanding deep systemic reforms instead of the WEF's minor fixes.
