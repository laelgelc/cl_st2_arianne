Our oceans are vital to life on Earth, producing half of the planet's oxygen and providing food for a billion people. They also play a crucial role in absorbing carbon, helping to fight climate change. Yet, vast areas of open waters remain unregulated, home to diverse marine life that thrives among underwater mountains and trenches. To safeguard these ecosystems, we need a strong UN Ocean Treaty that establishes protected sanctuaries in these high seas.

That's why a Greenpeace team is setting sail aboard the Esperanza for a year-long expedition from the North Pole to the South Pole. This journey will document the threats facing our oceans, carry out essential research, and push for urgent protections.

But powerful industries are working to weaken the treaty, putting our oceans at greater risk. We must act now to support a global plan that protects one-third of the world's oceans from destructive activities. Join us by signing our petition and help make this vision a reality.
