Taiwan is currently enduring its most severe drought in 56 years, which has persisted for 18 months. The absence of typhoons last summer has exacerbated the situation, leading to significant declines in reservoir levels. For instance, Techi Reservoir has experienced a 73.3% drop in volume, Baoshan Second Reservoir a 96.2% drop, and Zeng-wen Reservoir an 81.1% drop.

At Sun Moon Lake, water levels have reached record lows, exposing large areas of mud. This has negatively impacted tourism and local boat businesses. In Taichung, water shutoffs have been implemented, while agriculture has suffered, with tea harvests declining by 20%.

Projections indicate that climate change will intensify droughts in Taiwan, with spring rainfall expected to decrease by 13.2% by mid-century and the number of typhoons potentially halving by the end of the century.

Despite growth in solar and wind energy, over 80% of Taiwan's energy still comes from fossil fuels. Greenpeace is calling for the establishment of a net zero emissions timeline before 2050 and the implementation of carbon pricing to address these challenges.
