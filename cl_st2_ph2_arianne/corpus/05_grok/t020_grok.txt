In the fight for environmental justice, corporations are increasingly turning to a troubling tactic known as SLAPPs—Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation. These meritless lawsuits are designed to intimidate and silence environmental defenders by draining their time and resources.

Reports have documented 355 such SLAPP cases globally since 2015, with the majority occurring in the Global South. The fossil fuel industry alone has targeted over 150 entities through these actions.

Efforts to counter SLAPPs are gaining momentum, including a proposed federal bill in the US and a directive in the EU aimed at protecting against these abusive lawsuits.

At Greenpeace, we're sharing our anti-SLAPP toolkit to help defenders, with a focus on raising awareness, funds, and voices to push back.

We're also celebrating a recent court dismissal of a $100 million lawsuit against us, marking a key victory in this ongoing battle.

Ultimately, SLAPPs pose a serious threat to free speech and public participation in environmental advocacy.
