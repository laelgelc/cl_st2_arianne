In our "Citizen Climate" series, we shine a light on global citizens taking action for a healthier planet. Today, we hear from Kenyan photojournalist and activist James Wakibia, who shares insights into the challenges of activism. He points out issues like funding shortages, the need to rely on personal finances, and failed grant applications, which often result in scaled-down efforts.

Wakibia urges support for climate-impacted communities in Kenya, including those dealing with floods at Lake Nakuru, job losses, and droughts. He highlights the importance of adaptation measures such as climate-smart agriculture and boosting public awareness to help these communities.

As an advocate against plastic pollution in rivers, Wakibia educates his 24,000 Twitter followers on the issue. He pushes for bans on single-use plastics and backs a strong Global Plastics Treaty in Paris, aimed at reducing fossil fuel-based production and working toward a plastic-free future.

Wakibia stresses the value of raising awareness to drive policy change. He also recognizes the crucial role of youth in mobilizing for the cause, bringing their energy, creativity, and technology to the forefront.
