In our "Citizen Climate" series, we spotlight global citizens taking bold steps toward a healthier planet. Kenyan photojournalist and activist James Wakibia shares insights into the financial hurdles faced by activists, who often rely on personal funds and encounter failed grant applications, resulting in scaled-down activities.

Wakibia emphasizes the need to support communities in Kenya hit hard by climate impacts, such as floods at Lake Nakuru, job losses, and droughts. He highlights adaptation measures like climate-smart agriculture and boosting public awareness to help these communities.

Turning to plastic pollution, Wakibia campaigns against plastics clogging rivers, educating his 24,000 Twitter followers, organizing temporary clean-ups, and advocating for bans on single-use plastics.

He calls for a robust Global Plastics Treaty in Paris to address fossil fuel-based plastic production and the pollution that damages environments, animals, air, and food supplies.

Wakibia also notes how youth contribute connectivity, energy, creativity, and technology to drive mobilization, raise awareness, and push for policy changes.
