After two years of Greenpeace's global campaign, which involved nearly 700,000 people, Thai Union – the world's largest tuna company and owner of brands like John West and Chicken of the Sea – has committed to a series of important reforms. These include reducing its use of fish aggregating devices (FADs) by 50% and doubling its supply of FAD-free fish by 2020, shifting to pole-and-line or troll-caught tuna, extending a moratorium on at-sea transshipment, ensuring observers are on longline vessels to combat labor abuse, and developing a code of conduct. An independent audit is planned for next year.

This is a significant step forward, and we urge other companies to follow Thai Union's lead in supporting sustainable fisheries. Let's continue holding them accountable to protect our oceans and the workers who depend on them.
