Every minute, a truckload of single-use plastics enters our oceans, contributing to massive environmental damage. Shockingly, only 9% of these plastics are recycled, with much of the waste being dumped in the global south, exacerbating inequalities and pollution there. It's time for companies like Coca-Cola and Nestlé to reduce their reliance on throwaway packaging for profit and shift toward more sustainable practices.

This issue extends to gadget waste, driven by frequent tech upgrades. For instance, Apple's release of new iPhones encourages consumers to discard older models, while deliberate slowing of those older devices pushes people to buy replacements sooner. We need to advocate for the "right to repair," empowering individuals to fix and maintain their electronics instead of constantly upgrading.

Inspired by Marie Kondo's method of decluttering to spark joy, we can apply this mindset to our possessions, helping us recognize the environmental toll of excess consumption. By letting go of unnecessary items, we uncover how overconsumption harms the planet. Instead, let's embrace sustainable alternatives, such as repairing clothes rather than turning to fast fashion, which pollutes waterways and exploits workers in its production processes.
