French and Belgian nuclear plants are vulnerable to outside attacks, hanging over us like a Sword of Damocles. A report commissioned by independent experts has been submitted to authorities in France, Belgium, Germany, Switzerland, and Luxembourg. It criticizes the poor protection of spent fuel storage pools, which hold large amounts of radioactive material. Unlike reinforced reactor buildings, these pools are inadequately secured against modern threats like those from criminals or isolated individuals post-9/11. If damaged, the pools could lose cooling water, releasing massive radioactivity. Greenpeace urges operators EDF and Engie-Electrabel to enhance security. For sensitivity reasons, we're withholding the full report but providing an executive summary.
