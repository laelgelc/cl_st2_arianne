It all began with a single student's act of courage, igniting the global school strikes movement that has grown into one of the largest climate actions worldwide. Young people are now protesting in countries including Vietnam, Kenya, Russia, Kosovo, Solomon Islands, Canada, Seychelles, Pakistan, Antarctica, Afghanistan, and Bangladesh. Students bravely demonstrate in cities like Kabul, Moscow, Karachi, and Ho Chi Minh, producing iconic images and expanding to new locations with each strike. This tribute honors these heroes amid the climate emergency, urging all to fight for a better planet for future generations.
