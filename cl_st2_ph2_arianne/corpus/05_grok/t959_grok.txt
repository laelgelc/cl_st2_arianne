3M has announced a new global sustainable paper buying policy, following campaigns by ForestEthics and Greenpeace. This policy is designed to help avoid forest destruction.

The policy includes several key elements. It prohibits paper from sources that threaten High Conservation Value Forests, Intact Forest Landscapes, or High Carbon Stock areas. It requires Free, Prior and Informed Consent from indigenous communities. It ensures worker rights, such as no forced or child labor and freedom to unionize. The policy also focuses on increasing the use of recycled and tree-free paper while reducing overall consumption. Additionally, 3M will provide public performance reports in collaboration with The Forest Trust.

As part of this shift, 3M has cut ties with an RGE subsidiary linked to APRIL's rainforest destruction in Indonesia. The company has also warned Resolute Forest Products to comply with the policy or risk losing business. These steps address issues including habitat degradation and indigenous conflicts.
