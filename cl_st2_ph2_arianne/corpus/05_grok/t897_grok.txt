Eight million people came together in a powerful display of collective action, forcing Shell to abandon its plans for Arctic oil drilling. That victory showed what we can achieve when we unite our voices for the planet.

Now, we're calling on you to help protect 226,150 km² of international Arctic waters—representing 10% of the Arctic—through the OSPAR commission. A decision is imminent, with just 18 days until the meeting starts on June 20 in Tenerife, Spain.

Climate change is rapidly exposing this least-protected ocean to new threats from oil exploration and industrial fishing.

Despite OSPAR's authority to safeguard these waters, Denmark, Norway, and Iceland are blocking the process.

We need your voices now to demand this protection. The Arctic's health affects the entire world, from regulating global climate to supporting biodiversity that sustains us all.

Why do you want to safeguard the Arctic? Share your reasons and join the call—together, we can make this happen.
