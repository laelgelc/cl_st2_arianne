Air pollution from burning fossil fuels is harming our health and driving climate change. Coal stands out as the worst offender, releasing high levels of CO2 along with toxins like mercury and arsenic, as well as soot that impacts hearts and lungs and raises the risk of strokes. Despite this, coal still powers over a third of global electricity. It's time to shift to renewables like wind and solar, where we've seen recent progress.

When it comes to cars, petrol and diesel vehicles emit CO2 and NO2, contributing to these problems. We need to promote car-free options in urban areas, such as public transport and cycling, alongside electric vehicles that are powered by renewables, made smaller, and shared.

Community action is key to making these changes happen. In China, mobilization has led to electrified buses. In Belgium, efforts have resulted in car bans. And in Turkey, collective action has driven coal plant closures. Let's come together for collective solutions to tackle this crisis.
