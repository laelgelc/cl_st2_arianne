In Bolsonaro's Brazil, the rights and lands of Indigenous Peoples are under serious threat from the Marco Temporal loophole. This loophole could legalize land theft by requiring Indigenous communities to prove they occupied their lands at the time of the 1988 constitution. Additionally, bill PL 490 seeks to open Indigenous territories to industrial agriculture and mining activities. These developments put isolated communities at risk and disregard centuries of Indigenous presence on these lands.

Greenpeace stands in support of defending these rights, recognizing Indigenous Peoples as essential guardians of the forests. The Articulation of Indigenous Peoples of Brazil (APIB) is calling on the Supreme Court to declare Marco Temporal unconstitutional, with court proceedings set to resume on August 25.

In June 2021, protesters in Brasília who gathered to oppose these threats faced violence.
