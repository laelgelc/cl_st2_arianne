I recently returned from a week-long trip with my Greenpeace Brazil team, starting in Porto Velho, where we documented the Amazon fires and deforestation that have been enabled by Bolsonaro’s government. Recent rain provided a brief respite, clearing the heavy smoke that has been obscuring the sky and severely impairing air quality.

During our time there, we interviewed health experts from Fiocruz, Agevisa, and a children’s hospital. They shared how the fires are having severe impacts on public health, especially for children and the elderly, with pollution spreading far and wide via the wind.

Local residents face these challenges year after year, enduring smoke, low humidity, and fires burning close by, all of which threaten their livelihoods.

This is the first in a series of posts on deforestation, logging, and land grabbing in the region.
