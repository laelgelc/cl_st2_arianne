In a bold act of peaceful protest, twenty-two Greenpeace USA activists have shut down the busiest U.S. oil shipping channel by suspending themselves from the Fred Hartman Bridge in Baytown, Texas. They plan to remain there for 24 hours to challenge the fossil fuel industry. This channel handles over 700,000 barrels of oil daily, with the potential to rise to 2 million barrels.

Dramatic footage from the action underscores the urgency of the climate crisis. Activist Irene Kim emphasized the emergency, calling for bold leadership and systemic change while pointing out the suffering of communities impacted by fossil fuels.

Greenpeace is calling on Democratic debate candidates in Houston to support a Green New Deal and reject fossil fuels.
