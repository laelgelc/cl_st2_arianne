This Mobility Week, Greenpeace is spotlighting our #MobilityForAll campaign through a series of actions across Europe, all focused on demanding equitable urban mobility. From transforming parking lots in Italy for Park(ing) Day to joining Romania's Critical Mass Bike Ride that pushes for 100 km of bike lanes in Bucharest, we're highlighting the need for change. In Belgium, activists are protesting against public transport cuts, while in Hungary, reverse graffiti on Car-Free Day is exposing air pollution deaths. Spain is seeing mobilizations against airport expansions.

Leading up to the week, events included protests in Germany at the IAA against climate-damaging cars and a model train display in Spain.

Throughout the week, we're promoting sustainable transport to cut CO2 emissions, with demands for car-free zones, improved public transport, accessibility, shared mobility, cycling infrastructure, and green spaces.
