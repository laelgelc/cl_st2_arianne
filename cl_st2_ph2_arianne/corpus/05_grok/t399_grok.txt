As we emerge from the Covid-19 pandemic, it's disheartening to see a return to 'business as usual' that's even worse than before. Public services are being slashed, environmental protections are being ignored, and polluters are receiving funding, all while crises like Siberian wildfires rage and devastation hits the Global South.

Governments are prioritizing economic growth over science, and this approach is failing us. We need real change that goes beyond mere greenwashing.

That's why Greenpeace is joining the Climate. Care. Uprising, partnering with grassroots groups in 16 European countries and around the world. This initiative includes over 70 activities from September 23 to October 15, aimed at demanding that recovery funds tackle Covid, climate breakdown, neoliberalism, and colonialism.

In the EU, for instance, the proposed 55% emissions reductions by 2030 fall short—science shows we need at least 65%.

Join us in this uprising to ensure that people and the planet come first.
