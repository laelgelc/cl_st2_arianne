The world is witnessing widespread international outrage in response to Putin's invasion of Ukraine. This moment demands solidarity from all of us, through actions like making donations, joining protests, and providing support for refugees fleeing the conflict.

It's crucial that banks and investors take immediate steps to halt their funding of Russian fossil fuels, which are directly financing this war. Institutions such as Credit Suisse, Schroders, Pictet, East Capital, Carnegie Fonder, Intesa SanPaolo, UniCredit, Société Générale, Raiffeisen Bank International, and UBS must stop these investments now.

Protests are already targeting banks in locations like Vienna and the Czech Republic, amplifying the call for change.

By redirecting money away from fossil fuels that fuel conflict and toward renewables, we can build a path to peace. European institutions have played a significant role in building Putin's power, and it's time to shift that influence toward sustainable solutions.
