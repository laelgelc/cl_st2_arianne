In September 2019, over seven million people across 180 countries took to the streets in what became the largest global climate demonstration in history. Led by youth through groups like Fridays For Future, these protests called for urgent climate action. From tag-teaming efforts in Moscow to protected marches in Kabul, plastic outfits in Nairobi, and widespread events throughout Latin America, the actions showcased global solidarity.

Diverse participants joined in, including unions, NGOs, grandparents, teachers, and parents. They brought creativity to the forefront with vibrant colors, banners, music, and dance, amplifying the message of environmental urgency.

As the COVID-19 pandemic unfolds, the movement is adapting by shifting to digital strikes on April 24, 2020. These online actions demand green legislation, such as the Green New Deal, and leverage social media and technology to connect people worldwide, fostering global debate and engagement.
