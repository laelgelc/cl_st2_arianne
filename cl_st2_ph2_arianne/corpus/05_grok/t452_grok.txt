Today marks World Tuna Day, a perfect opportunity to celebrate these magnificent creatures that grace our oceans. Tuna are known for their stunning beauty and impressive size, embodying the wonders of marine life.

Yet, as we honor them, we must confront the devastating impacts of industrial fishing. Practices like illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing contribute to overfishing, depleting tuna populations at an alarming rate. Bycatch is another major issue, ensnaring unintended species such as turtles and sharks in the process. Moreover, distant water fishing vessels often exploit migrant workers, subjecting them to poor conditions and withheld wages.

To turn the tide, we advocate for supporting small-scale, ethical fisheries. Governments should invest in these operations to strengthen local economies, enhance ocean health, protect worker rights, and improve food security—especially in the face of disruptions caused by COVID-19.

By committing to a just transition toward sustainable methods, we can allow fish populations to recover and build more resilient supply chains for the future.
