Nate Hagens, who transitioned from a Wall Street executive to an ecology analyst, shares insights from his shift in focus toward studying energy limits. He founded the Institute for the Study of Energy & Our Future and hosts podcasts such as The Great Simplification, where he interviews experts on ecological predicaments.

Hagens describes "The Great Simplification" as the upcoming reversal of societal complexity, driven by declining surplus from fossil energy, alongside increasing debt and environmental constraints. He highlights the issue of energy blindness in society and points out that renewables cannot completely substitute for fossil fuels.

To address these challenges, Hagens promotes building local resiliency, cutting back on consumption, and fostering greater ecological awareness as ways to lessen potential future harms.
