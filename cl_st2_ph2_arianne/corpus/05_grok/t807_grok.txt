The Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) has certified an Antarctic krill fishery as sustainable, but this decision has drawn objections from organizations including the Pew Environment Group and the Antarctic and Southern Ocean Coalition. This certification overlooks critical issues that undermine its validity.

One major concern is the vulnerability of krill to climate change and ocean acidification, which threaten their populations in ways not adequately addressed. Another issue is the unsustainable expansion of fishing operations into remote areas of the Southern Ocean, pushing boundaries that could lead to overexploitation. Additionally, there is limited knowledge about krill's life history, making it difficult to ensure truly sustainable practices.

By granting this certification, the MSC is essentially legitimizing the exploitation of krill, which serves as a foundational food source for whales, seals, penguins, and fish. This could harm entire ecosystems in the Antarctic region. It's worth noting that harvested krill is primarily used for producing oil and as feed for farmed fish, rather than for direct human consumption.
