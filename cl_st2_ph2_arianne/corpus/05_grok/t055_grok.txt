In 2013, during COP19, I was in Warsaw representing the Philippines while Super Typhoon Haiyan ravaged my home country. My brother survived the storm, but thousands of others lost their lives in the devastation. As a parent now, I live with the fear of increasingly severe climate disasters, all driven by the burning of fossil fuels.

This is why I call out companies like Shell for their enormous carbon pollution, which is ten times that of the entire Philippines. In 2022, Shell reported record profits that surpassed the costs needed to clean up after the floods in Pakistan. It's time for them to pay for the loss and damage they've caused.

Progress was made at COP27, where a loss and damage fund was finally agreed upon. That's why I joined Greenpeace activists in protesting at Shell's oil platform in the North Sea, demanding an end to their oil extraction and holding them accountable for the climate harm they're inflicting on the world.
