In 2019, massive wildfires swept through forests across the globe, from Russia and Brazil to Indonesia and Australia. These fires led to the deaths of countless wildlife and humans, while releasing enormous quantities of CO2 into the atmosphere. Russia's fires alone emitted 500 million tonnes of CO2, Brazil's released 366 million tonnes, and Indonesia's contributed 708 million tonnes—amounts comparable to the annual fossil fuel emissions of major countries.

According to a Greenpeace report, these nations are underreporting their fire emissions, with no proper accounting or compensation in place. Beyond CO2, the fires generate black carbon, which speeds up the melting of Arctic ice, and they diminish forests' ability to capture carbon.

Despite the profound effects on climate, health, communities, and Indigenous Peoples, this critical issue was overlooked at COP25. It's time for leaders to take urgent action.
