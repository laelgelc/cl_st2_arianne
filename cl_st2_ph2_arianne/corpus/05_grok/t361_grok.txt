In May 2020, a catastrophic environmental disaster unfolded when over 20,000 tons of diesel fuel spilled from a storage tank owned by Norilsk Nickel near the city of Norilsk in Russia. This incident polluted the Ambarnaya River and became the largest oil spill ever recorded in the polar Arctic region.

Russia's environmental watchdog, Rosprirodnadzor, took legal action by suing the company. The court ultimately ordered Norilsk Nickel to pay 146 billion rubles—equivalent to nearly 2 billion USD—in damages, setting a record as the highest such penalty in Russian history.

At Greenpeace, we worked to bring attention to the spill by sharing satellite images that illustrated the extent of the damage. In collaboration with the independent newspaper Novaya Gazeta, we organized an expedition to the affected area. Despite restrictions imposed by the company, our team documented how oil products were continuing to spread toward the Kara Sea.

This tragedy underscores the urgent need to phase out oil in favor of carbon-free energy sources. We must prioritize a green recovery that protects vulnerable ecosystems and supports Indigenous communities impacted by such disasters.
