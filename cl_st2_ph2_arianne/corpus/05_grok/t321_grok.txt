We've just wrapped up an incredible leg of our journey aboard the ship, transitioning from the Caribbean to the Pacific through the Panama Canal. The passage began with a two-day queue before we could start the actual crossing, which took nine hours as we navigated through six locks. Adding in a half-day for mast maintenance, the whole process spanned three days. During the transit, our crew spotted fascinating wildlife along the way, including cranes, various waterfowls, and even a crocodile. We took careful precautions to maintain distance from the Canal staff amid the ongoing pandemic.

Now in the Pacific, the ocean has come alive with encounters of spotted and spinner dolphins, sea turtles, tuna, and an array of seabirds. These sightings underscore the urgent need to protect our oceans from threats like ghost nets and destructive fishing practices. Back in the Caribbean, we were treated to views of flying fish gliding over the waves and seabirds such as pelicans and boobies soaring nearby.
