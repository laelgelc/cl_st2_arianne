On Penguin Awareness Day, penguins made surprising appearances waddling in diverse locations around the world. They were spotted ice skating in Stockholm, tap dancing in London, trekking in Turkey, marching in Tokyo, roaming Israel's deserts, and even swimming in the Dead Sea. These playful displays were all in support of creating an Antarctic ocean sanctuary.

This sanctuary would protect penguins, whales, and seals by barring industrial fishing vessels that harvest krill, which is essential for Antarctic life. Healthy oceans sustain wildlife, mitigate climate change, and ensure food security for billions.

We invite readers to join the movement to safeguard penguins' home, allowing them to continue waddling forever.
