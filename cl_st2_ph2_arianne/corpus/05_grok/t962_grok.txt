I joined the "We are fed up" march against agribusiness in Berlin on January 17, and the large turnout highlighted widespread concern for food production and its origins. I was surprised by Germany's strong food movement, akin to North America's.

The food system is failing us, with pesticides, genetically engineered seeds, industrial animal farming, pollution from fertilizers, weakened protections via TTIP/CETA, and threats to bees.

There is hope from people adopting organic, low-meat diets, buying local, gardening, and joining food justice groups. I urge readers to connect with local farms and movements for better food systems.
