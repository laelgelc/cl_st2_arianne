I'm Sarah North, an oil campaigner currently aboard the Greenpeace ship Arctic Sunrise in the North Sea. What started as a simple trip from London to Scotland to walk my dog turned into something entirely unexpected: joining the front lines of a protest against a BP oil rig.

For the past ten days, our team of activists has occupied the rig in Cromarty Firth. We've repeatedly forced it to turn back, stopping BP from proceeding with drilling. This is BP's only new rig this year, and if it goes ahead, it would extract 30 million barrels of oil right in the midst of the climate crisis.

I'm incredibly proud of our team for holding strong. I hope that this action will convince BP to drop their plans for more oil drilling.
