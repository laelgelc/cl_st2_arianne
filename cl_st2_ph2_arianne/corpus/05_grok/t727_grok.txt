Our recent Antarctic expedition set out to observe incredible wildlife, including penguins and whales, in one of the planet's most remote regions. What we discovered, however, was deeply concerning: microplastics in water samples and hazardous chemicals in snow, even in freshly fallen snow. These findings reveal just how widespread pollution has become, reaching even this isolated part of the world.

During the expedition, we also encountered visible fishing waste, such as buoys and nets, which we removed from the area. These discoveries underscore the urgent need to tackle plastic pollution right at its source—by reducing production and putting an end to single-use plastics.

Now, governments have a critical opportunity to establish an Antarctic Ocean Sanctuary that's five times the size of Germany. With the support of 1.6 million people, this sanctuary would help protect marine life from these ongoing pressures.
