One year after the shocking Amazon fires that captured global attention, the destruction of the rainforest continues unabated. As we mark this grim anniversary, 2020 is shaping up to be potentially even more devastating for the Amazon and the Indigenous Peoples who call it home.

Greenpeace Brazil has captured aerial images from Mato Grosso that show fires still raging, even in the face of a government-imposed ban. These images underscore the ban's complete ineffectiveness in curbing the flames.

Last year, over a million hectares of the Amazon burned, and this June alone saw record numbers of fire hotspots detected.

At the heart of this crisis are President Bolsonaro's policies, which are systematically dismantling environmental protections. This has opened the door to unchecked deforestation, much of it aimed at clearing land for pastures.

The consequences are dire: this ongoing destruction is exacerbating the climate crisis, accelerating biodiversity loss, and posing severe threats to Indigenous lives. The situation is made even worse by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has brought high mortality rates to these communities, compounded by respiratory risks from the smoke.

In response, mounting pressure from investors and the public is calling for urgent action: stronger environmental laws, increased funding for enforcement agencies, robust protection of Indigenous rights, and a complete halt to business dealings with those responsible for forest destruction.
