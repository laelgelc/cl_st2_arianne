Young activists Andreas Magnusson and Ell Ottosson Jarl from Fridays for Future recently sat down with Greenpeace founder Rex Weyler to share their journeys into climate activism. They explained how their paths began through personal nature experiences, research into extinctions, and anti-war sentiments.

The conversation also delved into what keeps them going despite feelings of overwhelm. For Andreas and Ell, key sources of motivation include global friendships, anger at injustice, community support, and the act of staying active in the movement.

They pointed out positive signs in the fight against climate change, such as increased media attention and the prevalence of greenwashing.

Rex Weyler offered insights on strengthening international connections within activism. He emphasized managing egos, practicing meditation, and studying leaders like Gandhi as ways to build resilience and unity in movements.
