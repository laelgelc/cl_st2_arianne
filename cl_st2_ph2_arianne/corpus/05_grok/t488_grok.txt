In the arid landscapes of Kitui County, Kenya, smallholder farmer Mwende tends to her three-acre plot, growing green grams, cowpeas, maize, and millet. These crops are essential for her family's livelihood and to cover school fees for her children. After enduring three long years of drought, the arrival of heavy rains finally offered hope for a bumper harvest.

But on February 3, disaster struck when a massive swarm of desert locusts descended on her farm. Mwende spent days trying to chase them away by swinging an iron sheet, a method commonly used by local farmers in the area.

This locust outbreak is the worst in decades, intensified by climate-driven cyclones that have created ideal breeding conditions for the insects. The swarms are capable of devouring vast amounts of vegetation, and with eggs laid in the soil, further invasions loom as more rains approach.

Farmers like Mwende are calling for urgent government action to address this crisis, which has been exacerbated by climate change.
