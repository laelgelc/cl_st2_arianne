Greenpeace has released a powerful video calling on LEGO to sever its ties with Shell. The video shows a LEGO-constructed Arctic landscape devastated by an imagined oil spill, highlighting the real dangers posed by Shell's Arctic drilling plans, which could wreak havoc on the fragile ecosystem.

Produced in collaboration with the agency Don’t Panic, the film includes cameos from characters in the LEGO Movie, Game of Thrones, and even Santa Claus. It's designed to build pressure on LEGO by encouraging people to share it widely.

This partnership raises serious questions about LEGO's choice of ethical partners. LEGO promotes environmental values to children, yet aligning with Shell contradicts this, given Shell's role in pollution and the threats it poses to the Arctic.

Greenpeace is urging LEGO to end its relationship with Shell to safeguard the Arctic and protect children from these conflicting messages.
