The Dvinsky Forest stands as one of Russia's last Intact Forest Landscapes in Europe, providing habitat for eagle-owls, wolverines, brown bears, and rare species. Yet this vital ecosystem faces destruction from logging activities.

Certification schemes such as FSC and PEFC are failing to protect the forest, enabling companies to gain market access while sourcing from intact areas. FSC's Motion 65, aimed at protection, is now at risk, and PEFC offers no support.

In 2001, a Greenpeace campaign successfully halted logging in the core of the forest through agreements. However, companies including Arkhangelsk Pulp & Paper Mill, ICE Titan, Solombalales, and Region-Les are now pressuring authorities to resume operations.

Without formal protection, the forest could be erased within a decade. Greenpeace urges loggers, authorities, and FSC to safeguard this essential part of the Great Northern Forest for biodiversity and climate.
