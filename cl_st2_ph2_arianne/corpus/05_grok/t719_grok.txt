The Salish Sea spans coastal waters off British Columbia and the US northwest. It is a biologically diverse ecosystem that supports over 200 bird and mammal species.

This area faces risks from the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion. The expansion will increase tanker traffic sevenfold. These tankers will carry tar sands oil, heightening noise pollution and oil spill dangers.

Highlighted species at risk include the giant Pacific octopus, known for its size and speed. Endangered southern resident orcas are threatened by noise and spills. Clever sea otters are vulnerable to oil. Migrating grey whales are also at risk. Record-holding leatherback turtles are highlighted as well.
