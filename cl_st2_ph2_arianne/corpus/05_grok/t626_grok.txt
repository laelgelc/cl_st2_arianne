Dumaguete City in the Philippines, once a beautiful landscape, has been turned into a dumping ground for global plastic pollution. I witnessed its impacts firsthand during my visit. While Southeast Asia is often blamed for this crisis, the waste originates mainly from Europe and North America. A GAIA report identifies Nestlé and Unilever as top sources in Philippine waste audits, accusing corporations of using communities as dumping grounds via the global waste trade. It's time for corporations to phase out single-use plastics. Local heroes like Froilan Grate and Merci Ferrer are leading the way in the #BreakFreeFromPlastic movement.
