Chiara Milford has been avoiding new clothing purchases since 2014, choosing instead to rely on second-hand, inherited, or borrowed items. She embraces worn clothes and enjoys upcycling them to give them new life. Thrift-shopping, she notes, offers benefits like affordability and the chance to find unique pieces, even though it can be challenging to locate specific items.

To further promote sustainability, Chiara encourages clothes swapping through social media as a way to reduce the need for new production. She suggests setting personal goals, such as skipping purchases on Black Friday or committing to wear items more than 30 times.

In critiquing disposable fashion, Chiara points out its environmental harm and advocates for fixing, altering, and cherishing existing wardrobes to achieve a more sustainable approach to style.
