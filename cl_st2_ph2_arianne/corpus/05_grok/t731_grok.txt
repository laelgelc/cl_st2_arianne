In her book "Small Arcs of Larger Circles," Nora Bateson delves into the dynamics of mutual learning within living systems, such as ecosystems and societies. These systems feature permeable boundaries that allow for ongoing interaction and adaptation among their components. Bateson introduces the term "vitae" to describe these interconnected living entities, and she coins "symmathesy" to refer to systems characterized by mutual learning, moving away from traditional mechanistic perspectives.

Through her Warm Data Labs, Bateson creates spaces for trans-contextual discussions on complex issues, including carbon emissions. These labs encourage participants to explore multifaceted challenges, generating insights that avoid rigid binary positions.

The book underscores that meaningful change arises from shifting patterns and relationships within these systems. Drawing on influences from ecology and art, along with examples like cellular adaptation, Bateson's work points toward addressing social and environmental injustices through this lens of interconnected learning.
