As the world grapples with an escalating biodiversity crisis that threatens mass extinctions, Greenpeace is calling on leaders from every nation to attend the CBD COP15 in Montreal. This critical gathering represents a pivotal opportunity to combat the loss of nature and secure a sustainable future.

We urge ambitious protections that include safeguarding at least 30% of the planet's land and seas by 2030. Recognizing the rights of Indigenous Peoples is essential, as is centering them in decision-making processes and ensuring they receive adequate funding to lead conservation efforts.

Implementation must happen across all nations, with a particular focus on providing funding to those communities and countries most impacted by the legacies of colonialism. The biodiversity crisis is as severe as the climate emergency, yet it remains relatively obscure, which heightens the risk of failure unless there is greater political participation from world leaders.

Biodiversity underpins human health, economies, and even solutions to climate change. That's why we're extending an open invitation to all leaders: join us in Montreal and take decisive action to protect our planet's vital ecosystems.
