At Greenpeace, we're deeply concerned about Facebook's mishandling of user data, as starkly illustrated by the Cambridge Analytica scandal. This incident allowed for election manipulation and poses serious threats to democracy, privacy, and even a green future.

We truly value social media platforms like Facebook for their role in connecting our supporters and helping us organize actions. That's why we're not deleting our pages. Instead, we're demanding accountability from Facebook and urging governments to step in and regulate data practices effectively.

The core issue lies in social media's business model, which relies on collecting vast amounts of data to serve targeted ads. This approach carries significant risks, including increased polarization in society.

At Greenpeace, we take a different path: we safeguard our supporters' data and never sell it. We encourage everyone to join us in taking action through Avaaz to strengthen data privacy and protect the integrity of our democracies.
