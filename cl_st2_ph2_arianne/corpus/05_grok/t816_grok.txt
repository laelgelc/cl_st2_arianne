Greenpeace activists hit the streets, capturing photographs of people who stand in support of protecting the Great Northern Forest. This vital effort focuses on safeguarding the forest's critical landscapes, which are essential for unique species and maintaining global climate stability.

We're calling on everyone to join the movement and pressure Essity to halt the destruction of this precious forest. In a powerful display, portraits of nearly 300 diverse supporters were carried to a threatened site in a Swedish forest, where logging is imminent. This location sits right next to a barren clearcut, highlighting the urgent stakes.

Participants' quotes underscore the need to save these old forests, drawing on their wisdom and roots to ensure a future rich in biodiversity and climate stability.
