Greenpeace USA is calling on Senators to eliminate fossil fuel subsidies and support the climate provisions in the Build Back Better Act. Meanwhile, more than 75,000 people have signed a petition demanding that the EU ban fossil fuel advertisements and sponsorships.

As world leaders gather at COP26 in Glasgow, it's crucial that they send a clear signal marking the end of the fossil fuel era. Oil companies such as BP and Shell are encountering restricted access to the event because of requirements for emissions plans.

In a recent U.S. Congressional hearing, executives from ExxonMobil, BP, Chevron, Shell, along with representatives from lobbying groups, declined to stop opposing emissions reductions. These entities have been involved in greenwashing and spreading disinformation. The chair of the committee has stated that subpoenas will be issued for documents related to these matters.
