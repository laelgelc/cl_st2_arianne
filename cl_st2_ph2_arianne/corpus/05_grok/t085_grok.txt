Our planet is facing a profound biodiversity crisis, where deforestation, overfishing, and resource extraction are pushing one million species toward extinction. This urgent threat demands immediate action, yet the Convention on Biological Diversity has fallen short due to weak implementation. We need clear mechanisms to ensure its goals are met effectively.

As world leaders gather at COP15, it's crucial that rich countries in the Global North step up by providing funding for ecosystem protection in the Global South. They must also redirect harmful subsidies to help close a staggering $700 billion finance gap that hinders conservation efforts.

Among the key demands, we must recognize the rights of Indigenous Peoples, who serve as stewards of 80% of the world's remaining biodiversity. It's essential to reject fortress conservation approaches that exclude communities. Instead, we should adopt the 30x30 target, aiming to conserve 30% of land and water by 2030, with a focus on centering Indigenous and local communities in these efforts.
