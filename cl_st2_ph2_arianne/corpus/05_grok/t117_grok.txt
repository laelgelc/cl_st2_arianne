Air pollution stands as a major global health risk, with the World Health Organization (WHO) tightening its PM 2.5 guidelines in 2021 to an annual average of 5 µg/m3. At Greenpeace, our campaigns across various countries are driving change to combat this crisis.

In Malaysia, our advocacy against haze has led to a human rights complaint, the establishment of a roundtable, and viral art interventions that raise awareness.

In Turkey, where high reliance on fossil fuels contributes to around 30,000 deaths annually, our efforts alongside other NGOs have resulted in the shutdown of coal plants and pushes for alignment with WHO standards.

In Indonesia, a lawsuit in Jakarta against officials for inaction on air pollution culminated in a 2021 verdict that ordered improvements in air quality, with subsequent appeals.

In Thailand, petitions and a lawsuit have prompted the revision of the PM 2.5 standard in 2023 to 37.5 µg/m3 daily.

These actions underscore the power of citizen unity in the fight for clean air.
