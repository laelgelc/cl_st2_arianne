World Fisheries Day, observed on November 21, is a time to celebrate sustainable small fisheries. However, it also shines a light on severe human rights abuses, such as forced labor, that plague distant water fisheries (DWF). These abuses are often driven by greedy corporations seeking to maximize profits.

As fish stocks decline, fishing vessels are forced to venture farther into the ocean. This push leads to the exploitation of migrant workers as a way to cut costs. The result is tainted seafood entering global markets, largely because buyers fail to conduct proper due diligence.

Greenpeace has connected the Taiwanese firm FCF to instances of forced labor and illegal fishing. Additionally, the US Department of Labor has listed Taiwan for these labor practices.

To address these issues, governments need to enforce stronger protections for workers at sea. At the same time, consumers can play a role by reducing their seafood consumption and choosing local, sustainable options to help foster a more ethical and sustainable fishing industry.
