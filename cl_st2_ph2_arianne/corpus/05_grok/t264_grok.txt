The climate crisis is real and urgent, demanding immediate action from all of us. We must stop pipelines through Indigenous-led resistance, standing in solidarity with those on the frontlines protecting their lands and our shared future.

To avert catastrophe, we need to achieve zero global emissions, starting by halving them by 2030. Governments must align their targets with 1.5°C limits, especially as we approach COP26, where bold commitments are essential.

Financial institutions have a critical role: they must divest from fossil fuels without resorting to greenwashing, ensuring their actions truly support a sustainable path.

Fixing our broken food system is key, which means ending deforestation and promoting plant-based diets to reduce emissions and preserve biodiversity.

We also need to transform transport systems to cut pollution and build cleaner alternatives.

Protecting at least 30% of ecosystems worldwide is vital for maintaining the planet's health and resilience.

Supporting Indigenous rights is non-negotiable, recognizing their leadership in environmental stewardship.

As we prepare for the impacts of climate change, we must do so justly, applying the polluter pays principle to hold those responsible accountable.

Solidarity is crucial, delivered through robust climate finance to support vulnerable communities globally.

We advocate for a just transition away from fossil fuels, with no new investments in this destructive industry.

Finally, we can leverage the COVID-19 recovery for a green future, powered by people coming together to demand and drive change.
