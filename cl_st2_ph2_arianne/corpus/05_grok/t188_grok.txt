At Greenpeace, we're always looking for powerful ways to spark conversations about the climate crisis and inspire action. One of our favorites is the satirical film "Don't Look Up," which uses the story of a comet hurtling toward Earth—and scientists desperately trying to warn a distracted world—to mirror the real-world climate emergency. It hits close to home for us, especially resonating with Greenpeace co-founder Rex Weyler, who sees parallels in how urgent warnings are often ignored.

We've got more recommendations to fuel your environmental passion. Check out the documentary that debunks myths around meat consumption, featuring insights from Arnold Schwarzenegger. Then there's "Sexy Killer," which uncovers the scandals and corruption in Indonesia's coal industry. For a deep dive into ocean threats, watch the film highlighting coral bleaching in Australia.

Leonardo DiCaprio takes viewers on a global journey exploring climate change impacts in his documentary. We also love the film that tells the story of Greenpeace's founding, capturing the spirit of our origins. "Parasite" offers a lens on social inequality and how it intersects with climate effects. Dive into Sylvia Earle's advocacy for ocean protection in her inspiring work.

A documentary on minimalism encourages reducing consumption for a healthier planet. And don't miss the stories of Brazilians directly impacted by climate change, bringing personal faces to the crisis.
