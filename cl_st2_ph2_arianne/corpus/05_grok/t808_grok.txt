Around the world, people are calling on banks to stop financing harmful tar sands pipelines like Dakota Access, Kinder Morgan, Keystone XL, and Line 3. These pipelines pose serious threats to Indigenous communities, clean water, wildlife, and climate stability, often proceeding without consent.

The Indigenous-led Mazaska Talks Global Days of Action took place from October 23-25, sparking over 50 protests in more than 60 cities across six countries under the banner #DivestTheGlobe. These actions targeted and disrupted banks such as Chase, Toronto-Dominion, and Credit Suisse.

We urge everyone to sign the petition to pressure these banks to divest. The situation underscores ongoing violations of Indigenous rights, with efforts like building tiny houses to block pipeline construction highlighting the resistance.
