Fossil gas is a climate killer, acting as a major source of Europe's greenhouse gas emissions through methane leaks. It's also fueling Russia's war in Ukraine, with EU states paying billions for Russian imports while no embargo is in place. Beyond that, gas contributes to energy poverty and poses serious health hazards, as appliances can cause respiratory issues and accidents. One stark example is a sunken rig that's leaking methane into the environment.

Despite these dangers, the EU's RePowerEU plan simply substitutes Russian gas with supplies from other sources and even proposes labeling gas as 'green' to attract investments. To achieve true energy security, we must phase out gas by 2035, turning instead to renewables, efficiency measures, and better insulation.
