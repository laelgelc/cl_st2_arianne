Deep beneath the ocean's surface, seamounts rise as underwater volcanic mountains, forming vibrant wildlife hotspots. These structures work by upwelling nutrients from the seafloor, drawing in diverse marine life. Many seamounts lie in the high seas, areas beyond national waters, where they encounter significant protection challenges. Regulatory gaps in these international zones are often exploited by destructive industries, leaving these ecosystems vulnerable.

At Greenpeace, we're actively campaigning for a global ocean treaty to safeguard precious ecosystems, including places like Mount Vema. As part of our pole-to-pole journey, we're conducting research into ocean biodiversity and the threats it faces.

Mount Vema itself stands an impressive 4,600 meters tall—equivalent to 767 giraffes stacked on top of each other. It was discovered in 1957 and 1959 during expeditions searching for diamonds, but instead, it revealed populations of Tristan rock lobsters that have since been overfished. Today, the seamount is littered with harmful ghost fishing gear. Through a global treaty, ecosystems like Mount Vema could finally receive the protection they need.
