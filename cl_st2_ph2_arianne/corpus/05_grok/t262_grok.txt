The climate crisis is being driven by fossil fuels, and it's time we face the harsh reality. Companies and politicians are making empty promises, spreading lies, and pushing false solutions that sabotage real emission cuts, all while harming the most vulnerable among us.

That's why we're calling for a ban on fossil fuel propaganda through a European Citizens Initiative. We need 1 million signatures to prohibit ads and sponsorships for fossil fuels, related transport, and the companies involved. This is our push for a #FossilFreeRevolution.

Just like Big Tobacco, Big Oil is denying responsibility, greenwashing their image, and delaying action through slick marketing. Firms like Shell and BP are prime examples of this tactic.

The consequences are dire: deadly air pollution, species extinction, and extreme weather that's displacing millions of people. We can't let this continue—join us in demanding change.
