In a significant step forward for plastic reduction in Asia, 7-Eleven Taiwan has announced plans to phase out single-use plastics by 2050, with a goal of 10% annual reductions. This marks the first such commitment from a major Asian convenience store chain.

The announcement comes after two years of campaigning by Greenpeace East Asia, which included retailer rankings, a 2020 investigation that uncovered 15,000 tons of annual plastic waste from 7-Eleven stores, and a petition gathering 210,000 signatures.

7-Eleven Taiwan has already launched pilot programs, such as cup rentals and reusable delivery packages.

Greenpeace is urging the company to accelerate its efforts and expand these initiatives globally.

Other positive developments include Family Mart's programs for reusable containers and cups, as well as Foodpanda's plastic-free options in Tainan.
