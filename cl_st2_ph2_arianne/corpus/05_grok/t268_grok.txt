Fifty years ago, a small group sailed from Canada to protest a nuclear bomb test on an Alaskan island. That bold voyage inspired global action and led to the founding of Greenpeace.

This post pays tribute to those early members who transformed Greenpeace from a local, predominantly male, white group into a diverse, global organization. They shifted the focus to tackling the root causes of environmental destruction.

Among the key achievements are whaling moratoriums, halting nuclear testing, the Antarctic Treaty, and banning sea dumping.

Now, amid climate change and biodiversity crises enabled by profit-driven structures, it's time for unprecedented unity and action. We draw hope from past movements to demand a green, peaceful future.
