The Amazon rainforest is under severe threat from intentional fires and deforestation. These threats are primarily driven by land grabbers, illegal loggers, miners, and cattle ranchers, who have been emboldened by Bolsonaro's anti-environment policies since 2019. Deforestation has spiked as a result, with 17% of the forest lost over the past 40 years.

This destruction is pushing the Amazon toward a tipping point, where it could transform into a savanna. Such a change would harm biodiversity, Indigenous communities, and the global climate. Among the key drivers are agribusiness and meat production.

To address these issues, solutions include enforcing laws, designating protected areas, recognizing Indigenous lands, and ending deforestation in supply chains. There are calls to support the guardians of the forest, such as Indigenous Peoples and organizations like Greenpeace.
