The Kamchatka peninsula in Russia has been hit by a massive die-off of benthic marine organisms. Seawater in the area changed color, emitted an unpleasant smell, and caused health issues such as sore throats and nausea among locals, including surfers. Dead animals washed ashore, resulting in the death of 95% of seabed life near a UNESCO site.

Greenpeace Russia investigated the incident by taking samples, using drones, and consulting experts. The group is demanding an independent probe into the unknown cause, which could be natural, such as toxic algae, or human-related, such as waste dumping.

This event highlights Russia's environmental problems. Greenpeace urges a green economic transformation and references the Norilsk oil spill to advocate for renewable energy and policies that protect people and nature.
