Hope is more than just an emotion—it's a vital natural resource that fuels environmental activism and keeps us pushing forward in the fight for our planet. At Greenpeace, we've seen this firsthand over more than 50 years of victories that prove change is possible. From halting nuclear tests and whaling to recent legal wins against Shell, these achievements show the power of persistent action.

Recent progress offers even more reasons to hold onto that hope. The 2023 Global Ocean Treaty paves the way for marine sanctuaries, protecting vast areas of the ocean. Negotiations for a Global Plastics Treaty are underway, aiming to tackle plastic pollution at its source. Lawsuits against Greenpeace have been dismissed, allowing us to continue our work without undue interference. Indigenous resistance is delaying fossil fuel projects, demonstrating the strength of community-led efforts. The International Energy Agency outlines pathways to limit warming to 1.5°C through renewables, while solar and wind energy are becoming cheaper than ever. Financial institutions are shifting away from fossils, and the IPCC confirms we still have time to reduce emissions if we act now.

Yet, amid climate crises like devastating fires and floods that can bring despair, it's easy to feel overwhelmed. That's why we must come together in collective action—to preserve this essential resource of hope and drive the systemic change our world needs.
