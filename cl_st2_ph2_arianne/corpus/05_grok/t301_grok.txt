In May, Greenpeace International hosted a live conversation focused on extractivism in Latin America and the powerful community resistance against it. The event featured Rosario Coll and Sophie Schroder from Greenpeace's Collective Climate Action project, who contributed to the discussion.

As part of our Roundtable Discussion series, the conversation was moderated by journalist Stefanía Dommarco. The panel included Gustavo Huici, Riccardo Tiddi, Juan Sarmiento Lobo, Lorena Donaire, and Alejandra Jiménez Ramírez, who shared their firsthand experiences in combating deep sea oil exploration, deforestation, mining, water access issues, and fracking.

Throughout the discussion, participants emphasized Latin America's position as a key environmental battleground. They explored how these struggles intertwine with broader fights for sovereignty, equity, human rights, and alliances within global movements, all in the context of the ongoing climate crisis.
