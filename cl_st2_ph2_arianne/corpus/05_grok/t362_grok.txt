Today marks the International Day of Women and Girls in Science, a moment to reflect on persistent gender inequality in the field. Women make up less than 30% of researchers worldwide, and only 7% of 15-year-olds aspire to work in technical professions.

Despite these barriers, women scientists play a vital role in Greenpeace campaigns, from addressing climate change and protecting oceans to exploring links between COVID-19 and biodiversity.

Consider the words of Sandra Myrna Díaz, who describes biodiversity as a tapestry: when threads are pulled out through habitat destruction or species loss, the fabric weakens, increasing the risks of disease transmission from animals to humans.

This perspective underscores the urgency of our work. That's why we're excited about an upcoming expedition led by Kirsten Thompson aboard the Arctic Sunrise. The team will investigate the Saya de Malha Bank, focusing on its coral reefs, seagrass meadows, and marine life. Using tools like environmental DNA (eDNA) sampling, underwater photography, and acoustic monitoring, they'll gather data to support the push for a strong Global Ocean Treaty that protects at least 30% of the world's oceans by 2030.

Empowering women in science is key to these efforts, driving forward solutions for a healthier planet.
