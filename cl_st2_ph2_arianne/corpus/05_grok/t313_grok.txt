Deep in the remote Indian Ocean lies the Saya de Malha Bank, an underwater plateau as vast as Belgium. This hidden gem is home to the world's largest seagrass meadow, along with shallow corals and a thriving array of marine life. Endangered turtles glide through its waters, while sperm whales and pygmy blue whales roam these depths.

Seagrass meadows like this one play a crucial role in capturing significant amounts of CO2, helping combat climate change. They also act as vital nurseries for countless marine species, fostering biodiversity. Yet, these essential ecosystems are in decline worldwide due to human activity.

The threats to Saya de Malha are stark. Industrial fishing operations, including those by EU vessels, deploy purse seine nets and longlines in the area. These methods have led to the overfishing of yellowfin tuna, pushing populations to unsustainable levels. Worse still, they result in bycatch that harms turtles, whales, and sharks, endangering these species further.

To protect places like Saya de Malha, we need a strong Global Ocean Treaty. This treaty would enable the creation of sanctuaries in international waters, safeguarding these vital ecosystems from exploitation.
