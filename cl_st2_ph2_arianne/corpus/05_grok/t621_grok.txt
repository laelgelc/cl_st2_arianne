The global water crisis is worsening, and coal is a major culprit. In Cape Town, the city came perilously close to 'day zero,' when taps would run dry, and today, half a billion people around the world face ongoing water scarcity.

Coal exacerbates this crisis by polluting and depleting water resources at every stage: mining, washing, and burning. These processes release toxins into rivers and groundwater, with impacts visible in places like Indonesia, India, China, and Australia.

Coal-fired power plants guzzle enormous amounts of water, pulling it away from essential needs. They also contribute to climate change, which in turn makes droughts more severe.

By comparison, renewable options like wind and solar require very little water and offer more affordable energy solutions.
