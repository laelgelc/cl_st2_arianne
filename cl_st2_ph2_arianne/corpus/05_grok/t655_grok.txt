At the COP24 climate conference in Poland, Greenpeace campaigner Kelvin Anthony is representing Pacific nations, pressing Australia to break its reliance on coal as climate change accelerates. He points out the failure of leadership from major polluting countries, which prioritize profits, resulting in extreme weather events, rising sea levels, and dangers to the livelihoods and cultures of Pacific islands. Even though these Pacific communities contribute very little to global emissions, they confront existential threats and are pushing for a swift, equitable shift to renewable energy sources. Anthony finds inspiration in the future of his daughter, working to elevate the voices of those on the frontlines, expose inconsistencies, and demand action on a global scale.
