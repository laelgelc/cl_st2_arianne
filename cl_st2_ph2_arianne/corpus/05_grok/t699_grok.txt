As we approach the upcoming UN negotiations on a Global Ocean Treaty, this moment stands as a historic "last chance for the oceans" to finally prioritize protection over business interests. The high seas, which remain largely unprotected and cover two-thirds of the world's oceans, are at the heart of these talks. This treaty is essential because it would enable Member States to create sanctuaries that protect at least 30% of the oceans by 2030.

Oceans are vital for all life on Earth, serving as habitats for countless species, sources of food, and producers of oxygen. Yet they face severe threats from industrial fishing, plastic pollution, seafloor mining, and climate change. At Greenpeace, we'll be advocating in New York for these sanctuaries to be truly off-limits, giving marine life—like whales and corals—a chance to recover. Right now, only 1% of the oceans is protected, underscoring the urgency of this opportunity.
