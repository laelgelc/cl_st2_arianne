The first week of COP27 in Sharm el-Sheikh has been frustrating, with delays in funding discussions and unfulfilled promises from richer nations to provide $100 billion to developing countries. Negotiations have sidelined people and the planet, as the richest countries block a Loss and Damage Finance Facility that's essential for addressing climate impacts.

The final text must name fossil fuels as the cause of the crisis and commit to adequate financing.

On a positive note, Loss and Damage is now on the agenda. France has called for a deep sea mining ban, there's growing support for fossil fuel phase-out, civil society protests have taken place, and the presence of 600 fossil fuel lobbyists has been exposed. However, an agreement allows another decade of forest destruction.
