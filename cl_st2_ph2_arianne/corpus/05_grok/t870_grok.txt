Greenpeace China's campaign against pesticide overuse in food has been making strides since it began in 2008, amid a wave of food scandals across the country. Our efforts included a 2015 lawsuit against the retailer Lianhua, which played a key role in prompting Shanghai to set up a city-wide traceability system for fresh produce. This system sources 50% of the produce locally and has boosted food safety, serving as a national model.

Through this campaign, Lianhua was led to drop 46 harmful pesticides from their operations. Building on these changes, China's 2015 policy set a goal for zero increase in pesticide use by 2020, with sustainable organic farming emerging as a viable alternative.

However, challenges remain. Recent tests conducted on produce from 6 supermarkets in 8 cities showed that 87% of the samples had excessive pesticide levels, with plastic-wrapped items exhibiting the highest concentrations.
