As we navigate the COVID-19 crisis and the economic shocks it has unleashed, it's crucial that we prevent investments from flowing into planet-destroying industries. Instead, we must direct those funds toward a just transition that prioritizes planetary and human health.

We need to hold our leaders accountable and resist the corporate exploitation of workers through tactics like the Shock Doctrine. Let's commit to investing in a future that is open, cooperative, equal, and peaceful—one that exists in harmony with nature.

In the face of this virus, cooperation and solidarity are our greatest strengths. We should build alliances and focus on protecting the vulnerable rather than propping up harmful industries. Through compassion, courage, and new leadership, we can learn the lessons this moment offers.

On a personal note, I've been reflecting on finding balance amid these challenges, and I've witnessed inspiring acts of bravery and community that remind us of our shared resilience.
