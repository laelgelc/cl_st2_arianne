In the midst of the climate crisis, nuclear power is often touted as a quick, safe, and efficient way to decarbonize our energy systems. But this promotion overlooks some harsh realities that make it far from the ideal solution.

One major issue is the high cost. Nuclear energy comes in at $112 to $189 per megawatt-hour, which is significantly more expensive than renewables. On top of that, building nuclear plants takes an average of 10 years, delaying any potential benefits at a time when we need rapid action.

Nuclear facilities are also vulnerable to environmental stresses like heatwaves and water shortages, which can disrupt operations. And while it's pitched as low-carbon, the process involves significant CO2 emissions from construction and uranium mining and processing.

Then there's the problem of radioactive waste, which remains unmanaged and poses long-term risks. Taxpayers end up footing the bill for billions in costs associated with these projects. Security concerns add another layer of worry, with risks from terrorism, natural disasters, or conflicts—as we've seen in Ukraine, where nuclear sites have been caught in the crossfire of war.

Even newer technologies, such as EPR reactors and fusion, are plagued by delays and budgets that spiral out of control. In contrast, renewables provide faster, cheaper, and more scalable options to achieve the urgent emissions reductions we need right now.
