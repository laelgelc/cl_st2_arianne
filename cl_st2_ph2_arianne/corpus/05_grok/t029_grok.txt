Illegal mining in the Amazon is driving widespread deforestation and polluting rivers, while inflicting severe violence on Indigenous Peoples. This includes invasions of lands belonging to communities such as the Yanomami, Munduruku, and Kayapó, resulting in outbreaks of diseases, instances of sexual violence, murders, and deep divisions within these communities.

A 2022 report focused on the Yanomami territory reveals the devastating scale of these impacts, affecting 273 communities and more than half of the 27,000 inhabitants. The report notes that mined areas have surged by 625% since 2010. It also challenges the notion of economic benefits from this activity, pointing out that while there may be short-term gains, the long-term consequences include poverty and serious health issues, such as mercury contamination.

At Greenpeace, we are calling on Brazilian authorities to take decisive action: evict the illegal miners, enforce Indigenous rights, and implement sustainable policies to protect the region. There is renewed hope for progress under President Lula's government.
