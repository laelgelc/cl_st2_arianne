As I sit safely at home with my daughter during the COVID-19 pandemic, I can't help but reflect on what safety truly means. While I feel secure in my own space, I've been hearing from colleagues around the world about their experiences, and it's clear that safety looks different for everyone.

My colleagues describe safety as having access to clean water, clean air, and clean food. It means fair healthcare systems, governments that address inequalities, and real action on climate change.

This reflection brings into sharp focus the issue of excessive military spending. For example, the cost of one submarine at $3.4 billion could instead fund 30 hospitals. In the US, spending on defense is six times higher than on education, even as global peace is declining.

We need to redirect these funds toward healthcare, clean energy, and community support to achieve true safety, especially in the face of crises like pandemics, police violence, and environmental disasters.
