In 1945, the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki resulted in over 214,000 deaths by the end of the year, with lasting effects from radiation exposure.

In 1953, President Eisenhower delivered his "Atoms for Peace" speech, promoting the use of nuclear technology for energy production. This paved the way for Japan to construct its first nuclear power plant in 1966, followed by expansion of its nuclear program, even in the face of international incidents such as Three Mile Island and Chernobyl.

The 2011 Fukushima disaster led to the displacement of over 160,000 people, many of whom remain affected to this day.

Nuclear energy is not peaceful. Japan should abandon it in favor of renewable energy sources to promote true peace and sustainable development.
