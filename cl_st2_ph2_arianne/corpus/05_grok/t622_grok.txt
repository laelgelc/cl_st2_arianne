ExxonMobil is currently facing an inquiry in Brussels by the European Union, triggered by a petition from Food & Water Europe. The focus is on the company's involvement in climate change denial. ExxonMobil has known about the connections between fossil fuels and climate change since 1957, yet it has spent millions on efforts to deceive the public and delay necessary action. This has resulted in governments losing decades in addressing the issue.

Even though ExxonMobil has acknowledged the risks, its business plans still pose a threat of exceeding the limits set by the Paris Agreement. The company refused to participate in a hearing at the European Parliament regarding climate denial, which could lead to a ban on its lobbying activities. This refusal echoes its past behavior of avoiding inquiries in the Philippines and facing lawsuits in the United States.

We encourage everyone to tweet questions to ExxonMobil to demand accountability.
