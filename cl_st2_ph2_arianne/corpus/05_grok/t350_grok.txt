Sustainability certification labels have become a common sight on products like cocoa, coffee, palm oil, soy, and wood. Schemes such as FSC, PEFC, and Rainforest Alliance promise to ensure ethical and environmentally friendly practices, but they often fall short. These labels frequently fail to prevent deforestation, ecosystem destruction, and human rights abuses, including violations of Indigenous and labor rights.

Since gaining popularity in the 1990s, these certification systems have allowed companies to carry on with harmful practices. At the same time, they mislead consumers who believe they're making responsible choices.

It's time to move beyond relying on these flawed labels. Governments in both producer and consumer countries need to step up with stronger regulations and tracking systems. Companies must adopt robust standards to address these issues properly. This shift would place the responsibility where it belongs—on systemic change rather than individual buyers—to tackle the crises of climate change, biodiversity loss, and inequality.
