The Congo Basin, recognized as the world's second-largest tropical rainforest, is grappling with persistent deforestation and degradation. These activities are releasing significant carbon emissions and posing serious threats to climate stability. While some new research points to a potential slowdown in deforestation rates, other evidence highlights escalating threats to this vital ecosystem.

Projections indicate that the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) could lose 2.435 million hectares of intact primary forests over the next decade, primarily driven by agriculture and logging. Degradation is further accelerating overall forest loss, underscoring the importance of preserving intact landscapes, which serve as crucial carbon sinks.

At Greenpeace, we are urgently calling for actions to halt illegal logging, protect these forests, and promote responsible use by local communities. We also emphasize the growing concerns around rising degradation and emerging threats from oil palm plantations.
