I'm excited to share an update from our ongoing efforts to protect the world's oceans. Yu-Chi Huang, known as Kelly, a Greenpeace East Asia veteran from Taiwan, has joined the Rainbow Warrior as Onboard Digital Campaigner for the Global Protect the Oceans voyage in the Pacific.

The diverse international crew is sailing the eco-friendly ship, powered by wind at 7-10 knots, to bear witness to ocean threats like illegal fishing and deep-sea mining, while advocating for a strong UN Oceans Treaty.

Despite pandemic challenges, strict COVID protocols including multiple PCR tests and quarantine are ensuring safe operations for the nearly three-month journey without ports.
