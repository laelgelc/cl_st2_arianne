From graffiti protests in Lebanon to responses at the UN Summit, activists are making their voices heard.

In the Philippines, blockades are targeting Shell, while in Poland, similar actions are confronting coal operations. Climbers have taken bold steps against Burger King in London and on a bridge in Texas.

Massive climate strikes have drawn millions of participants worldwide, amplifying the urgency. Indigenous declarations are emphasizing justice, and campaigns are zeroing in on deforestation-linked companies, including fast food giants.
