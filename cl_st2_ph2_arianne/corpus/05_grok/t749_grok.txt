Today marks the 32nd anniversary of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster, a catastrophe that unleashed widespread contamination across Europe, Belarus, Ukraine, and Russia. The impacts of that event continue to pose ongoing risks to people and the environment in these regions.

As we reflect on Chernobyl's legacy, it's alarming to see Rosatom pushing forward with plans to deploy the world's first floating nuclear power plant, named 'Akademik Lomonosov,' in the Russian Arctic. This project is intended to support fossil fuel extraction along the Northern Sea Route.

The plant is being relocated from St. Petersburg to Murmansk for fueling and testing, before heading to Pevek to supply electricity. Such a venture carries the potential for catastrophes, especially in a remote and fragile Arctic environment.

This isn't an isolated idea—there have been past proposals for similar floating nuclear plants in Indonesia and the Philippines, raising further concerns about the global spread of these risky technologies.
