In a powerful move that's capturing headlines, the founder of a prominent outdoor brand has pledged all of the company's equity to fight the climate crisis, putting the planet's well-being ahead of shareholder profits. This decision underscores a vital shift: prioritizing Earth over endless financial gains.

As we face undeniable climate and biodiversity crises, it's time to choose action, hope, and courage. We can build a green and fair future grounded in justice and collaboration, where people and the planet always come before profit.

Around the world, challenges to neo-liberal capitalism are mounting, particularly from young people who connect it directly to rising inequality and environmental devastation. The environmental movement is responding by demanding we tackle these root causes, joining forces with activists and broader movements for systemic change.
