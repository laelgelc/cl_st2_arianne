In 2022, Pakistan faced devastating floods that impacted 33 million people, destroying homes and infrastructure across the country. These floods were declared the worst in Pakistan's history. Filmmaker Seemab Gul documented the crisis, traveling to regions including Balochistan, Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Sindh.

Through her films, Gul captured the stories of displaced residents who lost everything. She also highlighted the voices of activists who point to industrialized nations as responsible for exacerbating climate change, which fueled the disaster. Indigenous communities in these areas are shown bearing the heaviest costs of the floods.

The films underscore the stark reality of climate injustice. They contrast the $200 billion in profits made by fossil fuel giants with the $16 billion needed for reconstruction in Pakistan. This disparity calls for urgent compensation from Western nations and corporations to help address these human-made disasters.
