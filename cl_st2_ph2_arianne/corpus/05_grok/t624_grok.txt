Economist William Nordhaus has faced significant criticism for his dismissal of the Limits to Growth study and for underestimating the impacts of climate change in his economic models. Central to this critique is his Damage Function, which forecasts only minimal losses to GDP even under scenarios of significant global warming. This approach overlooks critical factors such as tipping points, the role of energy in the economy, and the complexities of ecological systems.

Prominent critics, including Steve Keen and Nicholas Stern, have described Nordhaus's models as absurd and unscientific. They argue that these models exhibit a bias toward perpetual economic growth, while systematically discounting the well-being of future generations and the poor.

This perspective ties into broader issues of growing wealth inequality, where the rich continue to benefit at the expense of humanity and the natural world. Neoliberal economics, in this view, serves to rationalize the plunder of the environment, perpetuating harm under the guise of progress.
