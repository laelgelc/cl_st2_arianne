As Managing Director of Greenpeace Germany, Roland Hipp is celebrating the end of nuclear power in Germany as a monumental victory driven by people power. This achievement comes after decades of persistent protests against reprocessing plants, waste transport, and new nuclear constructions.

Key successes in this long fight include halting the Wackersdorf reprocessing plant in 1989. Another milestone was the 2005 ban on waste shipments to Sellafield and La Hague, following Greenpeace's exposure of high radiation levels. Additionally, the unsuitable Gorleben repository was rejected.

Hipp emphasizes the inherent risks of nuclear power, pointing to disasters like Chernobyl and Fukushima. He also notes the dependency on uranium from Russia and the global absence of safe waste repositories. To ensure a secure future, he urges a full shift to renewables.
