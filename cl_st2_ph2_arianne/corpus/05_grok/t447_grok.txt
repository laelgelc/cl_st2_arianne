In Senegal, women like Jaba Diop and Fatou Samba, who work as fish processors, are calling on their government to prioritize support for local communities. They want aid to help clean processing sites during the ongoing health crisis, instead of granting 54 new licenses to Chinese and Turkish industrial vessels. These vessels have been linked to destructive practices and illegal fishing.

The new licenses pose a serious threat to fish stocks that are already declining and overexploited, according to assessments by the FAO. This situation is worsening food insecurity for around 40 million people across West Africa, with the impacts of COVID-19 making things even harder.

Meanwhile, artisanal fishing operations face restrictions, allowing them to work only three days a week. In contrast, the industrial vessels operate without such limits, which is damaging local livelihoods and the health of the ocean.

A petition is urging the government to provide this much-needed support for communities.
