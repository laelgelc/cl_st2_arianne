In the Pechora river region of Russia, devastating oil spills by Lukoil have been poisoning rivers, killing fish, and harming Indigenous communities. Local resident Galina Chuprova has compared the company to an invading enemy, urging villagers to unite in defense. Greenpeace volunteer Julia Lapshina has described witnessing toxic spills and questioned oil producers' disregard for safety. The Save Pechora Committee and Greenpeace are demanding reduced spills and higher standards. They organized a 'Skis against oil' race to rally locals for the Break Free from Fossil Fuels movement. Committee members Dmitriy Kanev and Fyodor Terentiev have shared motivations rooted in protecting nature and traditional ways, emphasizing collective action's power.
