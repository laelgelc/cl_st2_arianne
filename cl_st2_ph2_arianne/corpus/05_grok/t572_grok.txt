In our modern world, a culture of extravagant consumption is fueling an alarming surge in electronic waste, with devastating consequences for the planet. Take devices like iPhones, for instance, where planned obsolescence is built right in. Companies such as Apple create products that are notoriously hard to repair and actively lobby against right-to-repair laws, ensuring that gadgets become obsolete far too quickly.

This cycle begins with destructive mining for essential minerals, which ravages ecosystems and communities. Devices have shockingly short lifespans, contributing to a global e-waste problem that now exceeds 65 million tonnes annually. That's a mountain of discarded tech poisoning landfills and oceans.

Our latest Greenpeace report puts the spotlight on corporate responsibility by grading major firms on their repairability efforts. We're praising companies like HP, Dell, and Fairphone for leading the way in making devices easier to fix and extend. On the other hand, we're calling out Samsung and others for falling short and perpetuating the throwaway model.

To turn this around, we need a fundamental shift to circular production methods that prioritize reuse and recycling. Strong policies promoting product durability are essential, alongside a move toward modest consumption. These changes can help curb ecological overshoot and bolster the growth of renewable energy, paving the way for a more sustainable future.
