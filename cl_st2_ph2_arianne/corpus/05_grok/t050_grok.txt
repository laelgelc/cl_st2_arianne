Climate justice and social justice are deeply interconnected, forming the foundation for an equitable and sustainable future. As climate change intensifies, it exacerbates existing inequalities, hitting vulnerable communities the hardest. These include low-income countries, people of color, Indigenous Peoples, women, and those with disabilities, who have contributed the least to the crisis but bear the brunt of its impacts. They face increased disasters, resource scarcity, and staggering loss and damage costs, projected to reach 290-580 billion USD annually by 2030.

At the heart of this crisis are fossil fuels, which drive over 75% of greenhouse gas emissions. Addressing this requires a just phase-out of fossil fuels, transitioning from extractive economies to models that center people and their needs. It's crucial that polluters are held accountable for their role in perpetuating these harms.

In the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, rising temperatures, prolonged droughts, and severe floods are amplifying social injustices. These changes threaten ecosystems, livelihoods, and cultural heritage, as highlighted in documentation by Greenpeace.
