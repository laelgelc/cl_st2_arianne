Greenpeace is deeply mourning the tragic deaths of Homero Gómez and Raúl Hernández, two dedicated Mexican activists who were killed within days of each other. Both men were committed to protecting monarch butterfly habitats in Michoacán from the ravages of illegal logging. Homero Gómez managed a sanctuary in the region, while Raúl Hernández served as a tour guide, helping to raise awareness and support for these vital ecosystems.

These murders are a stark example of a broader global pattern of violence aimed at silencing environmental defenders. This violence unfolds against a backdrop of escalating threats, including climate change and ongoing corruption in the logging industry. In Latin America alone, targeted killings of such activists happen on a weekly basis, with similar patterns evident in places like Nicaragua.

Greenpeace is calling for justice in these cases, along with global solidarity and effective protections for land defenders everywhere. We must recognize the unequal risks faced by frontline activists who stand up for our planet's future.
