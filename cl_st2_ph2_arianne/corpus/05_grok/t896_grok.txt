World Meat Free Day is a perfect moment to pause and consider how our eating habits impact both our personal health and the health of the planet. Animal agriculture plays a significant role in issues like water pollution, deforestation, and climate change. By making thoughtful choices in our daily meals, we have the power to help reform this system.

To inspire you, we're sharing some delicious plant-based recipes from Daniel Bravo Garibi, the chef on board our Greenpeace ships. Daniel has been a dedicated Greenpeace volunteer since 2003, where he champions sustainable food procurement and encourages everyone to cut back on meat consumption.

Try his lentil ceviche or the purslane salad with citrus vinaigrette. You can find the full written recipes [here](link-to-recipes), along with instructional videos [here](link-to-videos), and Spanish versions [here](link-to-spanish-versions).

We invite you to give these recipes a go, share your own plant-based creations with us, and pledge to make a positive change through your food choices.
