In South Africa, where load shedding has plagued the country since 2007 due to mismanagement, sabotage, and corruption at the state-owned utility Eskom, innovative programs are stepping up to address the ongoing energy crisis. Common Power's Community Energy Accelerator (CEA) is training young professionals in solar project design, equipping them with essential skills to build a more sustainable future.

Participants in the program, such as Abongile Gogo, Chitola Mufali, Avuziwe Mfeka, Lucy Mofokeng, and Luvuyo Mdepha, emphasize the transformative benefits of community-led solar initiatives. These include democratized access to energy, empowerment of local communities, creation of jobs, provision of affordable green solutions, and greater independence from disruptive power outages.

The CEA program provides hands-on training in key areas like business development, digital tools, finance, and community engagement. As part of a pilot collaboration with Greenpeace Africa, the initiative is mentoring emerging developers to advance community solar and battery storage projects, fostering resilient and equitable energy systems across the region.
