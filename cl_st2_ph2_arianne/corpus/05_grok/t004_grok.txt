In South Africa, the ongoing energy crisis has been a harsh reality since 2007, with frequent load shedding stemming from mismanagement, sabotage, and corruption at the state-owned utility Eskom. To address this, Common Power's Community Energy Accelerator (CEA) is training young professionals in solar project design, offering a pathway to reliable and sustainable energy solutions.

Participants in the program, such as Abongile Gogo, Chitola Mufali, Avuziwe Mfeka, Lucy Mofokeng, and Luvuyo Mdepha, emphasize the transformative benefits. They point to democratized energy access that empowers communities, creates jobs, fosters independence from power outages, and provides affordable green alternatives. Amid rising energy costs and high unemployment rates worsened by corruption, the CEA builds essential skills in areas like business, digital tools, finance, and community engagement.

A pilot initiative in collaboration with Greenpeace Africa is now training mentors to support community solar and battery projects, further advancing these efforts to build a more equitable energy future.
