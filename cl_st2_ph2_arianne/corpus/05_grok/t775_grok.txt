Industrial meat and dairy production is wreaking havoc on our environment. It's driving forest destruction, polluting our water sources, creating vast ocean dead zones, and contributing to climate change on a scale equivalent to all global transportation combined.

Beyond the environmental toll, high meat consumption is linked to serious health problems, including cancer, heart disease, obesity, and diabetes. In contrast, shifting to plant-based diets could save millions of lives.

At Greenpeace, we envision a new generation of change-makers: children joining "Team Plant" to inspire a better future. We're urging governments to step up by supporting ecological farming, scaling back mega-farms, and promoting plant-based options in school meals.

On a personal level, reducing meat consumption is a powerful step everyone can take. Together, we can build a global movement for a healthier food system and a thriving planet.
