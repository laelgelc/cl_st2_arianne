Today marks the International Day of Forests on March 21, a perfect moment to celebrate the vital role forests play in our world and to take action for their protection. As we honor these ecosystems that sustain life, let's remember that one powerful step we can all take is reducing our meat consumption to help curb the pressures driving deforestation.

Around the globe, people are rising up to defend forests from destruction. Here are eight inspiring examples of people-powered fights against key threats:

Climate-driven fires are ravaging ancient forests in Tasmania, highlighting the urgent need for climate action to protect these irreplaceable ecosystems.

In the Amazon, a proposed mega-dam threatens the Tapajós River and the Munduruku Indigenous People who depend on it, sparking resistance to safeguard this vital waterway and community.

Illegal logging in China is endangering giant pandas, leading to calls for stronger protective strategies to preserve their habitats.

In Argentina, oil drilling plans in Calilegua National Park have been canceled, a victory for those fighting to keep industrial exploitation out of protected areas.

Advocates are pushing to maintain a logging moratorium in the Congo Basin, aiming to prevent further harm to this massive forest region.

Deforestation in Indonesia for palm oil production continues to devastate landscapes, fueling demands for sustainable alternatives.

In Canada, 85% of the Great Bear Rainforest has been protected, thanks to persistent efforts to shield this temperate rainforest from logging and development.

Demands are growing to halt cattle ranching in the Amazon that's directly linked to deforestation, as communities and activists work to stop the expansion of ranching operations.

With 80% of the world's forests already degraded, these fights remind us of the power of collective action. How are you celebrating forests today? Share your stories and join the movement to protect them for future generations.
