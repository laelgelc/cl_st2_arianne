The North Sea oil industry has been a major economic force since the 1960s, generating billions in profits for companies and revenue for governments. However, this has come at a tremendous cost. The industry has directly fueled the climate crisis through its operations, while causing extensive marine pollution—equivalent to one oil tanker accident every year and one chemical accident every day. It has also endangered biodiversity in the region, putting fragile ecosystems at risk.

Compounding these issues, job losses in the sector are on the rise, with no just transition in place to support workers. At the same time, ongoing emissions from oil activities are accelerating the climate emergency, making the situation even more urgent.

As we look toward post-COVID recovery, there's a real risk that efforts could lead to further harm to our oceans, the climate, and vulnerable communities that depend on these environments.

That's why we're calling for a #NorthSeaRevolution. It's time to transition to a fossil fuel-free North Sea, one that's powered entirely by 100% renewables. This shift would create greener jobs and help protect marine life for generations to come. We urge immediate action to #BuildBackBetter and secure a sustainable future.
