The outdated model of "fortress conservation" has long been a source of deep injustice, forcibly evicting Indigenous Peoples and local communities from their ancestral lands. This approach has resulted in severe abuses, including harassment and even murder by eco-guards, as seen in regions like the Congo Basin. As the world pushes toward ambitious 30x30 biodiversity targets—aiming to protect 30% of the planet's land and oceans by 2030—we must discard this colonial-era model to avoid perpetuating these harms.

Relying on such methods not only displaces those who have stewarded these ecosystems for generations but also opens the door to problematic solutions like offsets, which too often allow corporations to greenwash their destructive practices without real accountability.

Instead, the path forward lies in respecting the rights of Indigenous Peoples, granting them leadership roles in protected areas, and driving systemic changes to address corporate greed and inequality. Examples of success already exist, such as community-led protections in Mexico and Brazil, where local guardianship has proven effective in preserving biodiversity.

Achieving true harmony with nature demands that we support these frontline guardians of biodiversity, ensuring conservation efforts uplift rather than oppress.
