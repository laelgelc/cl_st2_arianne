In the midst of ecological crises, finding hope can feel elusive. Logic and big institutions like governments or corporations offer little in the way of real solutions, as global capitalism and pre-ecological politics fail to address overshoot. Instead, hope emerges from nature's long timescales, its wildness, and the humility it inspires. It lies in simple, local communities that restore habitats, in artists who inspire change, and in modest, persevering people.

Drawing on figures like Rachel Carson, Wendell Berry, and Leonard Cohen, this perspective emphasizes patience and persistence, much like spawning salmon pushing upstream. It calls for a return to indigenous, place-based living, favoring that over hubristic management.
