The COVID-19 pandemic has wreaked havoc in Brazil, with over 57,000 deaths reported. This crisis has been worsened by illegal miners invading Indigenous lands in the Amazon, where they could be spreading the virus among vulnerable communities. According to data from the Articulation of Indigenous Peoples of Brazil (APIB), as of June 29, there have been 9,294 confirmed cases among Indigenous people and 383 deaths. Protecting these lands is crucial to prevent what could amount to genocide.

In May, a Greenpeace flyover revealed the scale of illegal mining activities in the Munduruku and Sai Cinza Indigenous lands. These operations accounted for 60% of all mining-related deforestation alerts in the Amazon from January to April 2020. Meanwhile, the Yanomami Indigenous land is under siege from more than 20,000 illegal miners. Deforestation linked to mining in conservation units has surged by 80.62% compared to the previous year.

In response, Greenpeace filed a complaint that has resulted in a lawsuit calling on authorities to remove the illegal miners from these areas.
