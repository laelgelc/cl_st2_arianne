In the fight against climate change, it's time to challenge the financial systems that continue to fuel the crisis. Greenpeace Sweden is taking a bold stand through civil disobedience by refusing to pay portions of employer pension contributions to the state fund that's invested in fossil fuels. Instead, we're depositing that money into a safe account, holding it until policies are brought in line with the Paris Agreement.

This action underscores a critical warning: stranded fossil fuel assets could trigger an economic meltdown on the scale of the 2008 financial crisis. To avert disaster, we must scale up global divestment efforts, with institutions and individuals pulling their money out of fossil fuels.

A UN report highlights the scale of what's needed—$90 trillion in investments for renewable solutions to meet our climate goals.
