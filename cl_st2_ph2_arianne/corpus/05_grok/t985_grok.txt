Greenpeace is thrilled to celebrate Marks & Spencer's groundbreaking commitment to eliminate all hazardous chemical releases from its supply chain and products by 2020. As part of this pledge, M&S will phase out perfluorocarbons (PFCs) by July 1, 2016, reinforce a ban on APEOs, and set timelines for other priority chemicals. The company is also committing to transparency by releasing discharge data from five Chinese suppliers, with plans to expand this initiative.

M&S joins Puma, Nike, Adidas, H&M, C&A, and Li-Ning as the seventh major brand stepping up to detoxify the fashion industry and protect our waterways. This move sets a powerful example for the entire sector.

We urge more brands to follow suit and take action now. Join us by sharing this message publicly and participating in our campaigns to drive real change.
