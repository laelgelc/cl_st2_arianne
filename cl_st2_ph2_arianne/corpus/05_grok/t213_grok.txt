As we mark the 50th anniversary of Greenpeace, our thoughts turn to another milestone on the horizon: the anniversary of the Limits to Growth study. These events remind us that ecological awareness truly took root in the 1970s, a time when the first clear signs of environmental crisis were becoming impossible to ignore.

In the decades since, environmental movements have grown stronger, protective legislation has been enacted, and international conferences have convened to address the threats. Yet, despite these efforts, human society has failed to steer toward true sustainability. Biodiversity has suffered devastating losses, with sharp declines in wildlife biomass, insect populations, marine species, and forests. At the same time, the human population has doubled, and emissions have followed suit.

At the heart of this ongoing crisis lies overshoot—the fundamental issue of humanity exceeding Earth's regenerative capacity. This meta-problem drives the symptoms we see today, including climate change. Rather than settling for superficial fixes, we must push for a deeper understanding of ecological principles to guide our path forward.
