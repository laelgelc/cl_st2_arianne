In the Philippines, the COVID-19 lockdowns led to widespread hunger and unemployment. In response, Patricia Non started the Maginhawa community pantry in April 2021. It began with a simple cart where people could give what they can and take what they need in terms of food.

This model quickly gained traction and expanded to more than 6,700 pantries across the country. These pantries provided meals to thousands of people, including jeepney drivers who were hit hard by the restrictions.

The initiative also linked small farmers, such as Rosalina Tagle, with urban communities, helping to avoid crop waste by distributing produce that might otherwise go unused.

Over time, the effort developed into the BuyAnihan system. This system focuses on food sovereignty, prioritizing local sourcing and support for farmers.

Despite facing obstacles like red-tagging, the movement promotes mutual aid and builds resilience among communities. It also advocates for government measures to ensure sustainable access to food.
