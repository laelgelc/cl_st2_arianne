We mourn the loss of Jim Bohlen, a true founder of Greenpeace, who passed away on July 5, 2010, at the age of 84. Born in 1926 in New York City, Jim served as a radio operator in the US Navy before earning his engineering degree. In the late 1960s, he moved to Vancouver as a Quaker deeply opposed to the Vietnam War.

It was in 1968, at an anti-war protest, that Jim met Irving and Dorothy Stowe, leading him to join the Sierra Club. The following year, in 1969, they established the Don’t Make a Wave Committee to oppose US nuclear tests at Amchitka. Drawing inspiration from an idea by his wife Marie, Jim announced plans to sail a boat to the test site, sparking fundraising efforts and the eventual voyage of the Phyllis Cormack.

This bold action, which evolved into the Greenpeace campaign, delayed the nuclear tests and contributed to their ultimate cancellation. Jim remained dedicated to anti-nuclear activism through the 1980s, retiring in 1987. He later ran as a Green Party candidate, championing renewable energy.

Jim is survived by his family and the enduring spirit of Greenpeace.
