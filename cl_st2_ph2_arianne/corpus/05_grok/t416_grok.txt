I was in my suburban apartment in Beirut when the port explosion hit. It was caused by 2,750 tons of ammonium nitrate igniting, leading to over 150 deaths, 5,000 injuries, and widespread destruction across the city.

My first instinct was to check on my loved ones. Then, I quickly formed a Greenpeace MENA crisis team to make sure our staff were safe and to consult experts on the health risks from nitrogen dioxide and ozone pollution released in the blast.

With COVID-19 adding to the concerns, we developed safety guidelines for those affected. We're also investigating additional pollutants using satellite imagery.

The solidarity among Lebanese people is helping with the recovery efforts. Greenpeace is providing information on toxic dust and calling for donations to the Red Cross.
