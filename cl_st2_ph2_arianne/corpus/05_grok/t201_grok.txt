The latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) on climate change impacts, adaptation, and vulnerability paints a stark picture of the challenges we face. It underscores widespread losses and damages to nature and people around the world, with risks escalating even at lower levels of warming than what was previously assessed.

Adaptation efforts so far have been insufficient, leading to higher mortality rates in vulnerable countries. To minimize these damages, it's crucial to limit global warming to 1.5°C.

The report stresses the importance of conserving ecosystems, aiming to protect 30-50% of Earth's land, freshwater, and ocean areas. It also critiques unsustainable development practices that exacerbate these issues and calls for urgent global transitions to more sustainable paths.

At Greenpeace, we're urging support for a strong Global Ocean Treaty to safeguard marine life, along with broader efforts to protect biodiversity and uphold Indigenous rights. Key actions include phasing out fossil fuels to drive the necessary changes.
