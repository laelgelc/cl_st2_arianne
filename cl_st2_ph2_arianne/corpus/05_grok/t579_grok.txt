In the year 2000, Professor Gretchen Früh-Green made an astonishing discovery by chance while on a seafloor mapping expedition aboard the ship Atlantis. What she encountered was the Lost City hydrothermal vent field, a mesmerizing underwater world at 800 meters depth in the Atlantic Ocean. This unique site features awe-inspiring white cathedral-like structures, geysers, and vibrant colorful life, all sustained for thousands of years.

Professor Früh-Green highlights how this remarkable place could offer valuable insights into Earth's formation and the origins of life. Feeling a deep sense of protectiveness toward it, she cautions about the threats posed by unregulated deep-sea mining, including potential dust, noise, and unknown chemical impacts. To protect such vulnerable ocean wonders from destructive industries, she urges the adoption of a Global Ocean Treaty.
