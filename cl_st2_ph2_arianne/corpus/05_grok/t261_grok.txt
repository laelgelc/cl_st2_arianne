For 50 years, Greenpeace has woven creative activism and art into its core mission. It all began with the Phyllis Cormack, where activists painted peace and ecology symbols on the sails for the ship's inaugural voyage to protest U.S. nuclear testing in Amchitka. That bold action contributed to the cancellation of future tests there.

Since then, artists from around the world have joined the cause, lending their talents through music, designs, and protest actions. One such artist is Swiss creator Harald Naegeli, famous for spraying his signature stick figures across Zürich between 1977 and 1979. His work led to arrest, exile, and time in jail, but he returned to Switzerland in 2020.

To mark Greenpeace's 50th anniversary, Naegeli donated drawings for an auction. This gesture sparked the global Hope through Action mural project, which unfolded in 12 cities. The murals serve to inspire people everywhere to get involved—whether by signing petitions, writing letters, or joining protests—to drive positive change.
