In a powerful collaboration with Greenpeace Korea, Seoul-based celebrity photographer Cho Sun-Hee brought her talents to a W magazine photoshoot aimed at harnessing the influence of celebrities to spotlight critical environmental issues. The project focused on raising awareness about single-use plastics and the far-reaching impacts of climate change, such as heatwaves, typhoons, and shifting seasons.

Cho Sun-Hee stresses the importance of limiting disposables in our daily lives. She calls for stronger action from governments and corporations to address these challenges. Additionally, she advocates for public education, particularly in schools, to empower individuals and encourage personal efforts toward sustainability.

Through the photoshoot, Cho Sun-Hee utilized digital editing techniques to create compelling visuals that illustrate pressing problems like rising sea levels, while also showcasing solutions such as renewable energy.

This initiative not only amplified these messages but also deepened Cho Sun-Hee's own commitment to environmental causes, inspired in part by her son. The celebrities involved demonstrated sincere participation, adding authenticity to the effort.
