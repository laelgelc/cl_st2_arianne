The latest report from the IPCC's Working Group III lays out a clear path forward for tackling climate change and limiting global warming to 1.5°C. It stresses the critical need for urgent action to cut global emissions in half by 2030, pointing to proven solutions like expanding solar and wind energy, conserving forests, improving agricultural efficiency, and boosting energy efficiency overall. Many of these options come at low or even negative costs, making them practical and economically viable right now.

The report also shines a light on the growing role of climate litigation as a powerful tool for governance, holding polluters accountable. To make real progress, it calls for tripling investments in these solutions while simultaneously putting an end to subsidies for fossil fuels. Equity is a key theme, with a focus on addressing the outsized emissions from high emitters to ensure fairness in the global response.

Alarmingly, the report notes that no country is currently on track to meet the emission reductions needed. This underscores the necessity for transformative changes driven by strong policies, innovative approaches, and sustained public pressure. These efforts are vital to phasing out fossil fuels and supporting just transitions that protect communities and workers affected by the shift.
