A major oil spill at Russia's Nornickel plant in Taimyr, Siberia, has polluted vast areas of land and water, turning the Ambarnaya River red and rivaling the scale of past disasters. In an interview, Grigory Dyukarev, an indigenous leader, shared insights into Nornickel's long history of pollution and social irresponsibility, such as abandoning a new settlement. He described the spill's devastating effects on local fishing, hunting, and economies. Dyukarev also highlighted climate change impacts in the region, including warmer winters, thawing soil, and changes in wildlife patterns. He called for the establishment of a support program, along with environmental monitoring, restoration efforts, compensation for affected communities, and stricter legislation for the Arctic. Ongoing spills in remote areas continue to disproportionately affect indigenous communities.
