As we grapple with the harsh realities of climate change, it's impossible to ignore the ongoing inaction that's allowing CO2 levels to rise unchecked and emissions to hit record highs. This failure to act is being propped up by a reliance on unconventional fossil fuels, which are effectively masking the fact that conventional oil production has already peaked.

These unconventional sources—such as tar sands bitumen, heavy oils, synthetic liquids, deepwater oil, biofuels, and fracked tight oil—are far from ideal solutions. They are low-quality and require massive amounts of energy to extract and process, making them inefficient at their core. Worse still, they wreak havoc on the environment, leading to devastating spills, widespread pollution, serious health risks for communities, and extraordinarily high carbon emissions that only accelerate global warming.

The pursuit of these fuels isn't sustainable; it depends heavily on mounting debt and operates through Ponzi-like schemes that promise endless growth but deliver little more than illusion. By clinging to these problematic alternatives, we're delaying the urgent shift to renewable energy sources, which in turn exacerbates the climate crisis and pushes us closer to irreversible tipping points.
