In the fight against climate change, women and gender non-conforming individuals stand out as vital agents, driving essential action yet frequently excluded from key decision-making processes. This exclusion overlooks their unique perspectives and contributions, which are crucial for effective environmental strategies.

A significant barrier in this space is eco-ableism, which fosters distrust between disabled communities and environmental groups. To bridge this gap, there's a pressing need for inclusive shifts that ensure everyone, regardless of ability, can participate fully in climate efforts.
