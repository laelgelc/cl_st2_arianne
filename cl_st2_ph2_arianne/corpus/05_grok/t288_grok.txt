In 2021, the world witnessed a series of devastating extreme weather events that underscored the growing impacts of climate change. Floods ravaged parts of Europe, New York, central China, and Uganda, while intense heatwaves struck Canada and Morocco. Mudslides hit Japan, and cloud bursts caused havoc in India.

These events highlight how climate change is accelerating, making cities increasingly vulnerable to such disasters. To address this, we need effective early warning systems, coordinated responses, and bold action to halt the crisis.

At the heart of the problem are extractive industries, including fossil fuels and industrial agriculture, which operate on colonial business models, engage in greenwashing, and resist necessary emission cuts.

With just 100 days until COP26, it's crucial for world leaders to commit to capping global temperatures at 1.5ºC.
