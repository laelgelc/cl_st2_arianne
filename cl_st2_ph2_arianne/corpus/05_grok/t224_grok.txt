In 2021, a collection of inspiring animated films brought to light environmental injustices while motivating people to take action. Among them, the WoMin series showcased African women's resistance to resource theft and their visions for a better world. Another standout was "A Plastic Story," which warned about the legacy of plastic pollution passed down to future generations.

The animations also critiqued the UK's plastic waste exports and exposed big brands' connections to fossil fuels. They included conversations with climate justice activists, along with exposés revealing TotalEnergies' greenwashing tactics and the scams behind carbon offsetting.

We encourage everyone to share these videos, sign petitions, and dive into more animations to help build a green and just future.
