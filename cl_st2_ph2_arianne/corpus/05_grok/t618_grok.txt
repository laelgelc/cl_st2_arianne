In the wake of Tropical Cyclone Idai, I've been in touch with my sister in Beira, Mozambique, through phone calls that paint a heartbreaking picture of the aftermath. She's there on the ground, volunteering as a relief worker, and shares updates on the rising death tolls, widespread power outages, and endless lines for basic necessities like food and water. She describes bodies washing ashore, a grim reminder of the storm's toll.

The grief is everywhere, she says, with streets covered in mud and communities facing serious risks of cholera due to destroyed water access and poor sanitation. An upcoming vaccination campaign aims to address this threat.

Yet, amid the devastation, the resilience of African communities shines through. People are supporting each other, and local boatmen are stepping up to rescue those stranded, showing their true character in the face of catastrophe.
