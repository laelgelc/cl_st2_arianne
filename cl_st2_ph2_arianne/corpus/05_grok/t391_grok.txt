The fires raging across Brazil's Amazon are escalating to levels not seen in a decade, fueled by government policies that undermine environmental enforcement and open the door to agribusiness and mining expansion. These blazes are not just destroying vast swathes of rainforest; they're intensifying threats to Indigenous Peoples, who face land invasions by outsiders and the devastating impacts of COVID-19, with more than 34,000 cases and 837 deaths reported among their communities.

The destruction of the Amazon poses profound risks to global biodiversity, climate stability, and even regional rainfall patterns. As trees burn and ecosystems collapse, stored carbon is released into the atmosphere, creating a vicious cycle that accelerates climate change.

Beyond the Amazon, fires are also devastating the Cerrado and Pantanal biomes. The primary drivers behind this widespread destruction are cattle ranching, which accounts for 80% of deforestation in the Amazon, and soy production destined for livestock feed.

It's time for all of us to come together in collective action to safeguard these vital biomes and uphold the rights of Indigenous Peoples who have protected them for generations.
