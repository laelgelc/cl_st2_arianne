In the Indian Ocean, Greenpeace activists took bold action by disabling high-powered lights on the Explorer II vessel with water-based black paint. This protest targeted the vessel's fish-aggregating practices, which may have breached regulations. Meanwhile, the crew of the Esperanza has been actively removing dozens of fish aggregating devices (FADs), providing support to local Malagasy fishermen, and directly confronting destructive fishing operations in the area. As a result of these efforts, such lights have now been banned.

These actions are part of a broader global campaign. We've seen factory shutdowns in New Zealand and France, laser projections in Thailand, barcode matching to FADs, and the removal of Thai Union tuna from shelves in multiple countries. The campaign is putting pressure on companies like Thai Union, with more actions planned at Walmart and Sainsburys.
