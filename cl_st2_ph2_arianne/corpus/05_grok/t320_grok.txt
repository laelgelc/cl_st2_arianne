In the spirit of International Women’s Day, we draw inspiration from Vandana Shiva's address, which connects the colonization of Earth to the emancipation of women through food security and the protection of Indigenous seeds. This perspective honors the profound contributions of women who have shaped ecological awareness and driven environmental justice.

Consider Stephanie Mills, whose work has illuminated the impacts of population on our planet. Donella Meadows advanced systems theory and co-authored Limits to Growth, offering critical insights into resource boundaries. Rachel Carson's Silent Spring brought to light the dangers of chemicals, sparking widespread awareness of environmental hazards. Alice Hamilton pioneered reforms in industrial toxicology, addressing health risks in workplaces.

Among Greenpeace's own roots, founders Dorothy Stowe and Marie Bohlen played essential roles in launching our movement against nuclear testing and environmental destruction. Looking further back, the ancient Bishnoi tree-huggers exemplified early resistance to deforestation by embracing trees to protect them. The Chipko movement in India continued this legacy, with women hugging trees to prevent logging and preserve forests.

In contemporary times, activists like Greta Thunberg are leading paradigm shifts, mobilizing global action for climate justice and environmental protection. These women, across eras, have been pivotal in fostering ecological awareness and advocating for a sustainable future.
