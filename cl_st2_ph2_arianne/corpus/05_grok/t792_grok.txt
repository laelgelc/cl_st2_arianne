In a world where powerful institutions continue to destroy our planet, we at Greenpeace believe that resistance demands acts of courage from all of us. This means everything from joining protests to challenging consumerism and the feelings of powerlessness that hold us back.

Looking back, we've achieved so much together: exposing harmful trade deals, protecting vital ecosystems, establishing marine sanctuaries, holding polluters legally accountable, phasing out single-use plastics, and pushing for an end to fossil fuels.

Now, it's time to turn our focus to tomorrow. We must break the cycle of overconsumption, hold corporations accountable for their actions, reduce the impacts of industrial livestock, promote equality, and shake the inequitable power structures that perpetuate harm.

Even amid disheartening news, we can rise up with contagious courage. By embracing renewables, sustainable agriculture, and empowering leaders, we can rebuild a positive future for everyone.
