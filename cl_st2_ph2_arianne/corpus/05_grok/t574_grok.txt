Deep beneath the Atlantic Ocean, at a depth of 750 meters, lies the Lost City—a unique hydrothermal vent site discovered 20 years ago that resembles an abandoned metropolis. This extraordinary location holds immense scientific significance, offering potential clues to the origins of life on Earth.

However, the Lost City faces serious threats from deep sea mining activities targeting rare earth minerals, which could cause irreversible damage to its fragile ecosystems.

To draw attention to this hidden wonder, renowned artists Quentin Blake and Charlie Adlard have launched an Instagram #DrawThisInYourStyle challenge, inviting fellow artists to illustrate the Lost City's beauty and strangeness.

Participants are encouraged to share their creations using #TheLostCityInYourStyle and #ProtectTheOceans, sign a petition calling for a Global Ocean Treaty, and explore ways to learn more about protecting our oceans.
