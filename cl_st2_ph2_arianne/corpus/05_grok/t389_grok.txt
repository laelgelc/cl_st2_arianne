Kristian Sloth, a former journalist and Greenpeace Denmark Agricultural Campaigner, is bringing attention to the stories of Danes living near industrial pig factories through a new documentary film. These neighbors describe how a life-ruining stench has disrupted their daily lives, causing shame when visitors come over and preventing them from hanging laundry outside. They also report green algae forming on their homes due to ammonia emissions.

Residents experience various health issues, including headaches, stomach aches, diarrhea, and breathing difficulties, stemming from exposure to over 200 chemicals, such as ammonia and methane, which are linked to respiratory diseases. Scientific studies confirm that people in these areas face elevated risks of asthma, skin issues, and other health problems.

Many of these homes were purchased before the areas became industrialized, and they are now unsellable. Denmark is home to over 3,000 such factories and has the world's highest number of pigs per capita, pointing to a problem that extends globally.
