Two-thirds of the world's oceans are international waters that lack strong protection, with a focus on exploitation rather than conservation. This is particularly evident in the Central Arctic Ocean, which is warming at twice the rate of the global average. Sea ice there is melting rapidly, and there could be ice-free summers as early as 2030, exposing a new ocean filled with vulnerable marine life.

At Greenpeace, we're advocating for a sanctuary in the Central Arctic Ocean that would ban extractive activities such as fishing, mining, and oil drilling. This could be made possible through a proposed UN treaty. We've been monitoring the recent UN discussions to push for robust ocean protection and are urging all involved to take action now to create a lasting legacy of protection. The UN chair is aiming for an agreement by 2019.
