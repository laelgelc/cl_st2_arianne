In the heart of Oslo, Greenpeace activists projected powerful messages from young people and adults around the world onto the walls of Norway's Parliament building. Using megaphones, we amplified these voices, calling on the Norwegian government to immediately stop Arctic oil drilling and commit to phasing out fossil fuels. This urgent action is essential to safeguard the planet for future generations.

The messages included heartfelt quotes expressing deep fears about the worsening climate crisis, emphasizing the critical need to listen to scientific warnings, and pointing out Norway's massive role in global emissions through its oil exports—which are ten times higher than the country's own domestic CO2 output.

This demonstration is part of a broader fight, including a landmark lawsuit filed by Greenpeace Nordic and the youth organization Nature and Youth against the Norwegian government. The case draws on the Paris Agreement and protections in Norway's Constitution to challenge ongoing oil activities. Backed by more than 500,000 supporters and protests happening worldwide, this legal battle represents a pivotal moment in holding governments accountable for climate action.
