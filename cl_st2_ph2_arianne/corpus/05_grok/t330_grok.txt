Thirty-five years after the Chernobyl disaster, governments and companies continue building nuclear plants, including in Belarus and Russia's floating "Akademik Lomonosov," dubbed a "floating Chernobyl," while over 30 countries operate them. We must phase out nuclear energy in favor of renewables to avoid new risks. Challenges persist: no technology exists for the reactor's radioactive fuel, a 2016 sarcophagus buys time, and five million people in contaminated Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia areas receive ongoing radiation. Climate-driven 2020 forest fires in the exclusion zone, the largest yet, raised risks for firefighters; a planned Greenpeace-supported study will assess radiation doses during fires.
