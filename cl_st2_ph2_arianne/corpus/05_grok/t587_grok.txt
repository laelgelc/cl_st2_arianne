Across Europe, communities are bearing the brunt of factory farming's severe impacts, from health issues to environmental degradation. In France, residents like Nicolas Mougel endure toxic smells from nearby operations that disrupt family life and daily activities. Another local, identified only as N., attributes her rare eye cancer to pollution from a neighboring farm, highlighting the potential health risks tied to these facilities.

In Italy, individuals such as Maura Cappi have taken a stand, leading efforts that successfully halted expansions of factory farms in her area, demonstrating community resistance to these practices.

Over in Spain, farmer Ricardo Antón points out how factory farming threatens local ecosystems and undermines small-scale farms, putting traditional livelihoods at risk.

Meanwhile, in Denmark, Bente Joergensen experiences ongoing health problems triggered by persistent odors from industrial animal agriculture, affecting her quality of life.

These stories underscore broader issues, including pollution from factory farms, significant climate emissions, and loss of biodiversity. To address these challenges, we urge global support for eco-farming methods and veggie alternatives through our call to action—join us in pushing for sustainable changes that protect communities and the planet.
