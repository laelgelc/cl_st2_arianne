As a Greenpeace campaigner, I recently had a nightmare that my son was begging for a video game console during Black Friday sales. In the dream, I wished instead for him to cherish memories of exploring nature together. This vision highlights how consumerism, driven by relentless ads and big brands, pushes people toward overconsumption.

In our cities, this overconsumption is especially problematic, as urban areas produce nearly three-quarters of global emissions and would need 1.8 Earths to sustain their current lifestyles. The richest 10% of the population are responsible for 36-45% of those emissions, putting nature and food supplies at risk.

To address this, we need solutions like imposing carbon taxes on the super-rich, phasing out fossil fuels, and encouraging low-carbon ways of living. This includes reusing items, sharing resources, and prioritizing experiences over buying more objects. We should also regulate advertising and teach children that true happiness comes from doing things, not from purchasing them.
