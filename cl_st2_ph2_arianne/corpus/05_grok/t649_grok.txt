It's been a year since we at Greenpeace ramped up our campaign against the destruction of forests for palm oil production. We've been exposing how Wilmar, a major palm oil trader, is linked to companies destroying rainforests and how it sells this palm oil to global brands.

Our actions over the past year have been bold and widespread. We created murals in 20 cities to raise awareness. We occupied a Wilmar refinery and intercepted tankers carrying palm oil not once, but twice. We also directly confronted Mondelez about its connections to dirty palm oil, organizing protests and blockades at its sites in Italy, Germany, the UK, and the USA.

More than 1.3 million supporters joined us in pressuring these brands to take responsibility. This collective effort paid off when Wilmar published a plan to map its suppliers and stop buying from those involved in destruction.

With fewer than 400 days left until the 2020 commitments to end deforestation in the palm oil industry, we're committed to monitoring how these plans are implemented to ensure real change and put an end to deforestation.
