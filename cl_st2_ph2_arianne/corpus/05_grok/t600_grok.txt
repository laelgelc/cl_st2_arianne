As a post-doctoral researcher, Hillary Glandon joined a Greenpeace expedition in the Fram Strait to study Arctic Ocean ice conditions and ecosystems, ranging from ice to marine mammals. The team, led by Dr. Till Wagner, conducted measurements along 79°N latitude. They used a Rosette device every two degrees longitude to sample water for temperature, salinity, nutrients, phytoplankton, trace metals, zooplankton, acidity, isotopes, and currents at depths up to 250 meters. The team also measured ice thickness and took cores for salinity and biological analysis. Glandon observed for mammals and birds from the ship's bridge but saw none. She described the bright, surreal environment and challenges like eye sunburn.
