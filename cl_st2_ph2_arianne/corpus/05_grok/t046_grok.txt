Women are disproportionately affected by the climate crisis, facing harsher working conditions, health risks, and displacement. Fossil fuel projects exacerbate these issues, making the moral imperative to oppose polluting industries clear in order to prevent catastrophic weather and health hazards.

Female Greenpeace activists worldwide are leading the charge, with figures like Libby, Irene Wabiwa, Dana, Zanna, Edina Ifticene, Anita Cosgrove, and Anusha Narayanan showcasing their leadership in campaigns against oil, gas, and coal extraction. These efforts span locations such as the Congo, Eastern Mediterranean, Permian Basin, and Australia's Burrup Hub.

This work builds on the legacy of environmental leaders like Vandana Shiva, Greta Thunberg, and Wangari Maathai, who continue to inspire action against the climate crisis.
