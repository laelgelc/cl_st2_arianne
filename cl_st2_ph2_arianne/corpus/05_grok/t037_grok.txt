As an activist from Aotearoa with Ngāpuhi, Ngāti Wai, Ngati Porou, and Ngāti Whatua o Kaipara heritage, Quack Pirihi joined Pacific activists aboard Greenpeace’s Arctic Sunrise to attend the ISA conference in Jamaica. There, she highlighted Indigenous stakes in deep sea mining.

Pirihi stresses the deep cultural connections to land and ocean that define her people. She warns that deep sea mining worsens the ongoing impacts of colonization, including incarceration, mental illness, and systemic failures. These effects continue to block paths to healing and liberation for Indigenous communities.

Guided by her ancestors, Pirihi calls for solidarity among activists, the importance of showing up in international spaces like the ISA conference, and using playful protest as a tool for change.

She points out that without following proper protocols, such as karakia and karanga, outsiders undermine mana and create intrusions into sacred spaces.

While Papatūānuku has the power to cleanse and restore, deep sea mining poses a direct threat to livelihoods and the Māori identity intrinsically linked to the moana.
