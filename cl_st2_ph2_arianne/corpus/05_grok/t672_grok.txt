Jenni Laiti, a Sámi artist and activist, shares a profound connection to Sápmi, the traditional Indigenous territory of the Sámi people that spans northern Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Russia. For the Sámi, this land is not just a place—it's what shapes their culture, spirit, and very survival.

Yet, this vital territory faces severe threats from government and corporate exploitation. Mines and logging operations are already encroaching, and now there's a proposed Arctic Railway aimed at facilitating global trade through the melting sea ice. This railway would carve through the land, dividing it and disrupting the critical migration paths of reindeer. It could lead to accidents and pave the way for even more industrialization, including pulp mills and expanded logging that would devastate the forests so essential to reindeer herds and Sámi identity.

Laiti connects these local dangers to broader global concerns, echoing IPCC warnings about the escalating impacts of climate change. She calls for collective action to safeguard these forests, emphasizing that their protection is crucial not only for the Sámi but for the survival of us all.
