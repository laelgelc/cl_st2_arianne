In the heart of Leuven, Belgium, organic farmer Brecht Goussey manages a community-supported agriculture (CSA) farm on 1.5 hectares of land. This setup provides vegetables to 320 people, who come to harvest their own produce directly from the fields. Before turning to farming, Brecht worked as a social worker. Now, he envisions growing his operation into an integrated farm that includes crops, fruits, animals, and practices that boost biodiversity, such as using manure to enhance soil fertility.

However, Brecht faces significant hurdles with uncertain access to land and soaring prices driven by speculation, making it impossible for him to purchase the plot he needs. To overcome this, he's receiving support from the cooperative ‘De Landgenoten’, which acquires land and rents it to organic farmers at affordable rates.

Together with Greenpeace Belgium, Brecht is now crowdfunding to secure this farmland for ecological farming. This initiative aims to foster community ownership, protect soils, and prioritize biodiversity instead of relying on artificial methods.
