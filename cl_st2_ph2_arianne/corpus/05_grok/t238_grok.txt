The COP26 Glasgow Agreement has managed to keep the 1.5C goal alive by calling for 45% emissions cuts this decade, along with a weak phase-out of coal and fossil fuel subsidies. This marks the first time such mentions have appeared in a COP text. However, the agreement falls short on urgent action, which insults climate-vulnerable communities by failing to deliver promised funding for recovery, adaptation, and loss and damage. Offsets have received a disappointing boost, complete with loopholes that endanger nature and Indigenous Peoples. Throughout the process, activists, Indigenous leaders, and youth pushed for progress through protests and demands. Looking ahead, COP27 in Egypt must bring stronger targets and end fossil fuels.
