Greenpeace is marking 50 years since its founding in 1971 in Vancouver. The organization originated from a group of activists who set out to protest a US nuclear test on Amchitka Island. They sailed a boat they renamed "Greenpeace," and their actions pressured the US to cancel future tests there. This effort also inspired campaigns against French nuclear tests.

From those beginnings, the group expanded into anti-whaling efforts, using Zodiac boats to confront whaling fleets. These actions brought global recognition and led to the formation of Greenpeace International.

Yet, after 50 years of activism, environmental conditions have only worsened. Biodiversity loss and rising emissions point to an ecological "overshoot" crisis. Addressing this requires reducing human population and consumption to achieve sustainability.
