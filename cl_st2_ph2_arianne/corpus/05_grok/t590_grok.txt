Greenpeace activists are taking bold action against BP's oil rig in Scotland's Cromarty Firth, highlighting the urgent climate emergency. We're calling out BP for its greenwashing tactics and empty rhetoric on the Paris Agreement, all while the company pushes ahead with new oil extraction projects.

It started on June 9th when our activists boarded the rig and hung a massive "Climate Emergency" banner. They occupied the platform for days, standing firm even as police removed some protesters and injunctions were issued.

When the rig was towed out to the North Sea, our ship, the Arctic Sunrise, gave chase. This pursuit led to the rig making an unexpected U-turn and heading back to Scotland.

Meanwhile, solidarity protests have sprung up at BP stations, and we're urging people around the world to join in and help stop further drilling.
