In May and June 2015, Greenpeace teams embarked on expeditions to remote mountain areas across three continents. Our teams collected snow and water samples from these pristine locations, and the results were alarming: persistent and hazardous per- and poly-fluorinated chemicals, known as PFCs, were found in every single site.

PFCs are chemicals used in various industrial processes and in outdoor gear to provide waterproofing. These substances degrade very slowly, allowing them to spread globally through the environment. They pose serious risks, including harming reproduction, promoting tumors, and affecting hormone systems.

The outdoor industry, which often draws on images of untouched nature to market its products, is ironically contributing to the release of these chemicals into the very environments it celebrates.

Fortunately, safer alternatives that are free from PFCs do exist. During our expeditions, these PFC-free options performed well, proving that effective waterproofing is possible without relying on hazardous chemicals.

Greenpeace is calling on outdoor brands and consumers alike to join our Detox campaign and work together to eliminate PFCs from production and use.
