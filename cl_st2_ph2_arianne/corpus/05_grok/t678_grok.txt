In late October, governments from around the world will gather in Hobart, Australia, for a crucial meeting to decide on the creation of a vast Antarctic Ocean Sanctuary in the Weddell Sea. This proposed sanctuary would cover nearly two million square kilometers, making it the largest protected area on Earth. There are also additional proposals on the table to establish a network of such sanctuaries in the region.

The meeting is organized by the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), which includes 24 countries plus the European Union. Decisions at CCAMLR require unanimous consensus, meaning that even a single objection could block or weaken the sanctuary proposal, which has been put forward by the EU.

If approved, the sanctuary would restrict industrial fishing activities and help protect vital wildlife, including whales and penguins, in the face of global threats such as pollution and climate change. It would also play a key role in preserving the Antarctic as an essential carbon store.

This initiative has garnered massive public backing, with over two million people worldwide expressing their support. The meeting represents a major opportunity to safeguard this unique and fragile ecosystem for future generations.
