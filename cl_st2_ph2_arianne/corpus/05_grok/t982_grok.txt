Uniqlo has committed to eliminating all releases of hazardous chemicals from its global supply chain and products by 2020. This follows similar pledges from Zara, Mango, Esprit, and Levi’s.

The move comes from Uniqlo's parent company, Fast Retailing Group. It includes disclosing discharge data from 80% of suppliers in 2013 and leading the development of alternatives to hazardous chemicals.

The commitment covers brands like Comptoir des Cotonniers and Theory, benefiting communities affected by pollution.
