In the North and Northeast regions of Brazil, Indigenous Peoples are confronting severe invasions by land grabbers, loggers, and drug traffickers. To defend their territories, they have established groups known as Guardians of the Forest, dedicated to monitoring and protecting these areas.

Tragically, on November 1, 26-year-old Guardian Paulo Paulino Guajajara was murdered by armed loggers in an ambush on his land. His fellow Guardian, Laércio Souza Silva Guajajara, was shot but survived the attack. Paulino had been using technology to document the invasions and deforestation occurring in these regions.

This incident highlights the escalating threats faced by Indigenous defenders amid President Bolsonaro's agenda and a broader system of resource extraction that benefits multinational corporations. Between 2000 and 2018, 42 members of the Guajajara people were murdered. In the first nine months of 2019 alone, there were 160 reported invasions across 153 Indigenous Lands.

Indigenous leaders currently in Europe are calling for international pressure on Brazil to respect and enforce Indigenous rights and protections.
