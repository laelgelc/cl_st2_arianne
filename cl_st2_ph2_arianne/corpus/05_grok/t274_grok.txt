The remnants of Hurricane Ida recently swept through the Northeast US, delivering record-breaking rain, flash floods, and even a tornado. This devastating event impacted states including New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, and Maryland, resulting in over 40 deaths and disproportionately affecting marginalized communities.

In my own experience here in Brooklyn, we dealt with minor flooding, and I found myself checking in on loved ones to ensure they were safe amid the chaos.

Officials have connected this storm to the broader fossil fuel-driven climate crisis, which is unfolding against a backdrop of global extremes such as wildfires, heat waves, and floods. The latest IPCC report has issued a stark warning, describing it as a "code red for humanity." It calls for urgent action, including ending fossil fuel subsidies and pursuing a just transition to renewable energy sources.
