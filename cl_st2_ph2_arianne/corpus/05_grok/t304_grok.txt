Sri Lanka is facing a severe environmental disaster as tons of plastic pellets, which are microplastics used for single-use packaging, have washed ashore near the capital. These pellets are devastating beaches and threatening marine life. Authorities are warning people not to touch them due to their potential toxicity.

The incident originated from the X-Press Pearl ship, which caught fire on May 20 due to a nitric acid leak. This led to containers of the pellets falling overboard.

Shipping companies should be held accountable for this. Plastic needs to be classified as hazardous and assigned IMDG codes.

This crisis exposes a broken system in which fossil fuel and consumer brands prioritize profits. Their actions fuel plastic pollution, climate change, health issues, and social injustice.

Brands such as Coca-Cola, Nestlé, and Pepsi must abandon single-use plastics and shift to global reuse systems.
