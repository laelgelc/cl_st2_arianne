Governments recently gathered in Hobart, Australia, to negotiate the creation of a new Antarctic Ocean Sanctuary. Unfortunately, the proposal failed because of opposition from Russia, China, and Norway. Russia and China employed delaying tactics during the discussions. Even though 22 out of 25 countries supported the sanctuary, the Antarctic Ocean Commission (CCAMLR) operates on a requirement for unanimous agreement, which means a small minority can block important progress.

This failure leaves Antarctic wildlife exposed to serious threats like overfishing, pollution, and the impacts of climate change. We need broader systemic changes to protect our oceans, including a new UN global ocean treaty that would safeguard one-third of the world's oceans. With the backing of 2.7 million supporters, we vow to keep pushing forward in this vital campaign.
