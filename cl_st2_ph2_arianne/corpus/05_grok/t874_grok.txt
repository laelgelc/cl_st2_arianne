In Russia's Yamal Peninsula, an anthrax outbreak has struck with devastating consequences, claiming the lives of over 2,000 reindeer and a 12-year-old boy. The incident prompted the evacuation of nearly 400 people, with over 100 hospitalized and 25 receiving treatment.

Among those affected is Indigenous Nenets herder Alexey Nenyanga, who lost most of his reindeer herd. His belongings were destroyed in the process, and compensation remains uncertain.

The outbreak stemmed from an unusually hot summer that melted the permafrost, unleashing century-old anthrax bacteria. This was worsened by the authorities' decision to cancel annual reindeer vaccinations back in 2007.

This isn't the first climate-related hardship in the region; just two years earlier, extreme weather led to the starvation of 58,000 reindeer trapped under an iced-over tundra.

Such events highlight how climate change is threatening the survival of Indigenous communities in the area.
