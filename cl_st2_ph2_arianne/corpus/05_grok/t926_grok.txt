Our oceans are facing a severe crisis from plastic pollution, with eight million tonnes of plastic entering them every year, transforming these vital waters into what can only be described as "plastic soup." Disposable plastics don't just disappear; they persist in the environment, breaking down into tiny microplastics that infiltrate food chains and end up in the fish we eat and even in sea salt. Meanwhile, larger plastic pieces are deadly, killing seabirds, fish, turtles, and whales either by being ingested or through entanglement.

To combat this, we must embrace the principles of "Reduce, Reuse, Recycle." Here are five practical actions you can take: refuse single-use plastics such as bags and straws; avoid cosmetics containing microbeads; buy plastics responsibly and recycle them, while advocating for better recycling facilities if they're lacking in your area; participate in beach clean-up events; and encourage friends, family, and your community to join in these efforts.
