The collapse of Vale's dam has unleashed a wave of devastation on the Paraopeba River, contaminating it with toxic mud and heavy metals including nickel, mercury, lead, zinc, and cadmium. This pollution has left 40 kilometers of the river ecologically dead, plagued by high turbidity and a severe lack of oxygen.

Local residents, such as the couple Jair and Conceição, have been forced to abandon fishing in the river altogether. Instead, they now rely on an artificial dam for their needs. The community is grappling with profound sadness over the disappearance of various fish species and the loss of the river's once-vibrant beauty.

In response to the crisis, the city of Pará de Minas has declared a state of emergency, as the Paraopeba serves as its primary water source. This catastrophe has deeply disrupted daily routines for everyone in the area.
