In a recent conversation with Heather Russell, a vegan dietitian from The Vegan Society, we explored the growing popularity of vegan cafes and the delightful surprises found in plant-based meals. Russell highlighted the importance of essential supplements for vegans, including vitamin B12, D, iodine, and selenium, to support overall health.

She stressed the need for balanced nutrition, warning against relying on high-fat, sugary vegan junk food and instead encouraging a focus on whole grains, nuts, fruits, vegetables, and legumes. Russell also addressed how veganism can be affordable and adaptable to various cultures, making it accessible for more people.

When it comes to innovations like lab-grown meat, she critiqued options that still involve animal products. To promote sustainability, Russell recommended choosing seasonal produce. Looking ahead, she predicts a broader shift toward plant-based diets, driven by their environmental and health benefits.

For practical tips, Russell suggests incorporating legumes into meals and experimenting with plant milks to enhance everyday eating.
