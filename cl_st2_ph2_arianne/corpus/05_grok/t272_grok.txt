Looking back through a dozen photographs from my time as a Greenpeace photographer between 1974 and 1982 brings back a flood of memories. Those years were filled with intense campaigns, starting with our confrontations against Russian whaling fleets in the vast ocean. I'd be out there on Zodiac boats, trying to capture the action, but the photography challenges were immense—bouncing around on rough waves, spray everywhere, and no time to steady the shot.

Back then, pre-internet, our communication methods were basic: radio dispatches and mailed film rolls to get the word out. It all tied into Bobbi Hunter's "mind-bomb" theory, the idea that powerful images could explode in people's minds and drive social change, especially against whaling.

I remember key people who made it all happen, like Captain John Cormack steering our ships through dangerous waters, and activists such as Bree Drummond and Bobbi Hunter leading the charge. Fundraising was crucial, and one highlight was the Jerry Garcia benefit concert that helped keep our efforts afloat.

Our early offices were humble setups, but we pushed for international expansion, establishing a presence in Amsterdam to grow the movement. Onboard, crew interactions were a mix of camaraderie and tension, living in close quarters during long voyages.

One image stands out as iconic: the anti-whaling shot that captured the brutality and urgency of what we were fighting. Reflecting on it all, those campaigns highlighted ecological transitions that disrupted traditional livelihoods, forcing tough conversations about sustainability.
