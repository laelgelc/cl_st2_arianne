In 1954, the hydrogen bomb test at Bikini Atoll irradiated Marshall Islanders and Japanese fishermen, leading to deaths and health issues. Fast forward to 2011, and the Fukushima nuclear disaster unfolded when TEPCO ignored safety warnings, causing meltdowns and ongoing radioactive leaks into the Pacific Ocean. Cleanup costs have escalated to over 21 trillion yen, a burden shouldered by citizens. The disaster displaced 150,000 people, exacerbated gender inequalities, involved corruption with Yakuza ties, and led to forced returns to contaminated areas. Nuclear power stems from weapons production, creating global dead zones like Chernobyl. It represents a symptom of industrial collapse, and we must urge a shift toward societal simplification.
