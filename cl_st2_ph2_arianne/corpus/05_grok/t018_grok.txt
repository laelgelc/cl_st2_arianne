HD Hyundai Construction Equipment has pledged to halt sales of heavy machinery in the Amazonas, Roraima, and Pará states, cease maintenance and parts supply, and terminate a dealership contract. This move aims to prevent its excavators from aiding illegal gold mining in the Kayapó, Munduruku, and Yanomami Indigenous territories.

The pledge follows a Greenpeace report that revealed 176 excavators in these areas from 2021 to 2023, with 43% from HD HCE, making it the most popular brand among miners.

Greenpeace campaigns, including press conferences and demonstrations, pressured the company to take this step.

This decision marks a victory for Indigenous peoples. However, other manufacturers and the Brazilian government must also act to eradicate illegal mining.
