Thor S. Larsen has been a pioneer in polar bear research since 1965. He has shared his experiences studying over 2,000 bears, including magical moments like maternity den surveys in the Arctic. As a member of the IUCN Polar Bear Specialist Group, he helped initiate the 1973 Agreement on the Conservation of Polar Bears, which bans most hunting with exceptions for indigenous communities.

Today, polar bears face threats from retreating sea ice, which hinders their hunting and reproduction. Den numbers are declining in areas like Kong Karls Land and Wrangel Island, and pollution is also a concern. Many subpopulations are declining, requiring international action on climate change and pollution, plus protections for denning areas.
