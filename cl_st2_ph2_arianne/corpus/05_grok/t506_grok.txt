In the vast expanse of our oceans, a hidden crisis unfolds: modern slavery in the fishing industry, disproportionately impacting migrant workers from Indonesia and the Philippines. Media exposures have brought to light the inhumane conditions these workers endure, trapped in cycles of exploitation far from shore.

A key factor enabling this abuse is transshipment, the practice of transferring catch between vessels at sea. This allows crews to remain isolated for months or even years, creating an environment ripe for forced labor and unchecked exploitation. Despite these realities, governments have fallen short in their duty to protect these vulnerable individuals.

Greenpeace Southeast Asia's report, “Seabound: The Journey to Modern Slavery on the High Seas,” sheds light on this through firsthand testimonials from fishers. They recount experiences with deceptive recruitment agencies that prey on economic desperation, contracts riddled with language barriers that obscure true terms, and the push into distant water fishing fleets driven by overfishing in closer waters.

On Human Rights Day, we call on ASEAN states to take decisive action: enforce existing laws, tackle discrimination against migrant workers, and foster ethical practices across the industry to end this modern-day slavery.
