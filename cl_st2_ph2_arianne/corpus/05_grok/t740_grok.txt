Sprite's supplier, La Moraleja S.A., illegally deforested 3,000 hectares of protected native forests in Argentina for lemon juice production. This violation of the 2007 National Forest Law has harmed wildlife and climate defenses. Greenpeace has exposed this issue since 2013, pressuring Sprite and its parent company Coca-Cola, which claims a focus on sustainability. Over 300,000 people have demanded action, leading to La Moraleja losing its Rainforest Alliance certification and committing to restore only 1,400 hectares. We urge full restoration of all 3,000 hectares and the adoption of a zero deforestation policy. Sign the petition to hold Sprite accountable.
