Nature & Youth and Greenpeace Nordic, together with a coalition, have filed a legal case against the Norwegian government to halt Arctic oil exploration by Statoil. The lawsuit is led by Ingrid Skjoldvær and Truls Gulowsen. It invokes Article 112 of Norway's Constitution, which guarantees a healthy environment for future generations, and demands adherence to the Paris Agreement's 1.5-degree warming limit. The case highlights the contradiction of Norway's emission reduction promises amid new Barents Sea drilling plans. It emphasizes the need to keep 80% of fossil fuels underground to avert climate catastrophe. This people-powered action aims to protect the Arctic and inspire global resistance against fossil fuels.
