The COP15 UN Biodiversity Conference has wrapped up with the adoption of the Kunming-Montreal Agreement, which has been hailed as a historic step forward, though it's really just a starting point in the urgent effort to halt mass extinction. One of the key elements of this agreement is its recognition of Indigenous Peoples, who safeguard 80% of Earth's biodiversity even though they make up only 5% of the global population. It stresses the importance of respecting their rights, territories, consent, and participation, in line with the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Moving forward, Indigenous-led conservation needs to become the standard approach.

The agreement sets a target to protect 30% of land and seas by 2030, but it falls short by not excluding damaging activities from these protected areas. It also includes corporate schemes such as nature-based solutions, which carry risks of exploitation. On the finance side, the commitments outlined are still inadequate, underscoring the need for faster action. This includes establishing a fund in 2023 specifically for developing countries and Indigenous Peoples, as well as finalizing a Global Ocean Treaty.

Looking ahead, COP16 in Türkiye in 2024 will be an opportunity to build on these foundations and push for stronger measures to protect our planet's biodiversity.
