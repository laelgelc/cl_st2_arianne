It's time to abolish polluting internal combustion engine (ICE) cars to protect our planet and human health. Transport emissions have risen 25% higher in Europe and 74% globally since 1990, with road transport making up 70% of that total.

Greenpeace has created a map that tracks phase-out dates for petrol and diesel cars around the world. We encourage cities to compete to become the cleanest and citizens to push their representatives for restrictions and accountability.

Banning these vehicles will cut emissions and reduce health risks like lung cancer, asthma, and heart disease—impacts that are worse than smoking.

Instead, we must promote walking, cycling, renewable-powered public transport, and shared electric vehicles to redesign cities centered around people.
