The Munduruku Indigenous People have inhabited the Tapajós River area in the Brazilian Amazon for centuries. More than 12,000 Munduruku rely on the river for food, transportation, and cultural practices. For three decades, they have fought to protect their land from threats such as the São Luiz do Tapajós dam. That dam was halted last year with support from Greenpeace and people around the world, but 40 more dams are planned for the area.

To secure official recognition of their territory, the Munduruku created the "Map of Life" over two years. The map depicts their interdependence with nature. This week, the Munduruku joined 3,000 Indigenous People in Brasília to demand protection for their territories. They delivered the map to the Ministry of Justice.

Dams would flood vast areas, harming biodiversity and communities. Over 1.2 million people have signed a petition in solidarity with the Munduruku.
