On January 22, 2021, the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW) entered into force, making nuclear weapons illegal under international law, in the same way as chemical and biological weapons. The treaty was adopted by 122 states in 2017 and had been ratified by 50 states by October 2020. It prohibits the production, possession, use, transfer, and financing of nuclear weapons.

At Greenpeace, we are celebrating this milestone in our 50th anniversary year, and we honor the role played by the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (ICAN) in achieving it. While nuclear-armed states oppose the treaty, they are facing growing criticism and pressure.

Looking ahead, priorities include universalizing the treaty through more ratifications, monitoring its implementation, and mobilizing public support. This public support is evident in high approval rates in countries such as Finland and Belgium.
