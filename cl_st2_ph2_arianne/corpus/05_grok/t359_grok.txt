In our current economic system, often termed "Fossil Capital," the relentless pursuit of endless growth comes at a devastating cost to people and the planet. This system plunders precious resources, oppresses the most vulnerable populations, and perpetuates deepening inequalities, all while fueling the climate crisis through its dependence on fossil fuels.

The fallout from the 2008 financial crisis is a stark example, as governments imposed austerity measures that essentially sacrificed the future. These decisions have only intensified the multiple crises we face today, further aggravated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Throughout these upheavals, it's the most oppressed communities who bear the heaviest burdens, while those in power continue to reap the benefits.

The consequences are dire: increasing climate-related deaths, profound hardships for youth, women, and low-income communities, and accelerating biodiversity loss.

As activist Kaossara Sani powerfully states, it's time to take decisive action to dismantle this broken system and ignite a #FossilFreeRevolution.
