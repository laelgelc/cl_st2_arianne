The seafood industry harbors serious hidden issues that demand our attention. Migrant workers from Southeast Asia often endure exploitation, facing abuse and inhumane conditions while isolated at sea through practices like transshipment.

At the same time, climate change poses significant threats to our oceans, including warming and acidification. Yet, healthy marine life has the capacity to absorb carbon, underscoring the importance of protecting these ecosystems.

Overfishing and illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing exacerbate the problems, with IUU activities valued at up to $23.5 billion annually. These practices deplete fish stocks and harm biodiversity, particularly through destructive methods such as bottom trawling, longlining, and purse seining with fish aggregating devices (FADs).

These issues have profound impacts on coastal communities, threatening their livelihoods that depend on sustainable marine resources.

As consumers, we can make a difference by choosing sustainable seafood options and pressuring governments to implement ethical fisheries management.
