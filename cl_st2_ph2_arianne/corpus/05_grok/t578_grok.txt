Deep in the ocean's abyss, bizarre creatures and mysterious hydrothermal vents captivate our imagination. Take the Lost City, a remarkable site discovered in 2000, with its towering chimneys and unique life forms that thrive in extreme conditions. These vents may even hold clues to the origin of life on Earth, as chemical reactions there create hydrocarbons.

Yet, these wonders remain poorly understood, and deep-sea mining licenses now pose a serious threat, potentially destroying them before we can fully study their secrets.

That's why Greenpeace's Pole to Pole expedition is heading to the Lost City, to spotlight the need for protection against exploitation. We urge everyone to join us in supporting efforts to safeguard these vulnerable marine habitats.
