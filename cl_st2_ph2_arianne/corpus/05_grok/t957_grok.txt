I'm Aliyah Field, and right now, I'm aboard the Polar Pioneer in the Pacific Ocean, getting ready to take a stand against Shell's Arctic oil drilling. My plan is to scale an oil rig as part of this protest, and I'm pushing through my own personal fears and discomforts to make it happen.

This action is crucial because Shell's drilling poses serious environmental risks. It threatens our clean air, stable weather patterns, pristine beaches, and a habitable future for the generations coming after us.

I'm calling on you to join me, along with my five teammates and the more than 6 million supporters already standing with us. Together, our collective determination will prevail in stopping this corporate greed, no matter what individual obstacles we each face.
