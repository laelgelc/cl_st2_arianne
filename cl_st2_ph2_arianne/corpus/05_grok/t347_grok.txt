Industrial fishing is decimating ocean life, seabeds, wildlife, and food security for communities. The Indian Ocean Tuna Commission failed this week to agree on conservation measures for overfished yellowfin tuna, blocked by the EU and industrial interests from France and Spain prioritizing profits. This allows continued exploitation, threatening tuna collapse by 2024, sharks, and ecosystems, while harming small-scale fishers in places like Mauritius and Seychelles. Only 1% of oceans are protected, with 93% of fish populations overfished. A strong Global Ocean Treaty is needed to create sanctuaries; join calls to pressure governments.
