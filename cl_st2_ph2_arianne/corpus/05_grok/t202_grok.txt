As policy-makers convene in Nairobi for the United Nations Environment Assembly (UNEA) 5.2, the focus is on tackling the escalating plastic pollution crisis. This gathering presents a critical opportunity to make substantial decisions that could drive real change.

Fishers are sounding the alarm, reporting sharp declines in fish stocks, with plastic debris clogging their nets and even appearing inside the fish they catch. These issues are directly threatening food security, and fishers are calling for the enforcement of existing laws to curb the problem.

In Kenya, where plastic bans are already in place, pollution continues unabated, fueled by ongoing pressure to ease these restrictions.

It's time for a robust global plastics treaty that addresses the full life cycle of plastics. This treaty must include legally binding measures, commitments to keep oil and gas in the ground, promotion of refill and reuse systems, improved waste management, and support for just transitions.

The devastating effects are evident in places like South African townships, such as Lenasia, where plastic waste worsens flooding and deteriorates living conditions. Similarly, in remote areas of the Congo, plastic pollution is severely impacting local fishers and their livelihoods.
