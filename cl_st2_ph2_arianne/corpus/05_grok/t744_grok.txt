The Amur region in Russia is experiencing its worst wildfires of the year, driven by low winter snow and strong winds. These fires are transforming former forests into burning wastelands, with only permafrost areas remaining spared. The blazes are releasing massive amounts of CO2, which hinders progress toward Paris Agreement goals, and they are spreading soot that accelerates Arctic ice melt.

Greenpeace is advocating for the recognition of wildfire emissions in national carbon plans and is urging action in affected countries like Russia. Most of these fires are driven by human causes, such as careless burning. Prevention efforts include education, proper fire extinguishing, and reporting.

Greenpeace Russia has launched the Fire initiative to raise awareness and reduce wildfire severity. This comes amid global crises in places like Indonesia, the US, Canada, and Brazil. Over two million hectares have burned in the Amur region, emitting 110 megatonnes of CO2.
