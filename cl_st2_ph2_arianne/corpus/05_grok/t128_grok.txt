Greenpeace Argentina is intensifying its campaign against offshore oil development in the Argentine Sea, where proposed activities overlap with critical habitats for protected species, including the Southern Right Whale. Even though a precautionary measure had suspended these operations, a recent government resolution has approved Equinor's Environmental Impact Assessment, which breaches the Escazú Agreement's provisions on environmental rights and public participation.

In response, we've submitted a formal letter to authorities demanding the annulment of this approval. Our efforts also include ongoing protests, such as the #Atlanticazo demonstrations, to rally public opposition.

Equinor's track record raises serious concerns, with documented oil spills and leaks in Norway and Brazil. Seismic explorations and the risk of spills in the Argentine Sea could lead to devastating ecological and economic consequences.
