South African Minister Gwede Mantashe has approved Shell's seismic survey for oil and gas exploration off the Wild Coast, even in the face of strong local opposition and the recent failures at COP26. This decision comes despite Shell's troubling history in the Niger Delta, where oil spills have caused widespread environmental damage, sparking protests and violence against affected communities.

The seismic blasting involved in this survey poses serious threats to marine life, including southern right whales and coelacanths. It also endangers the livelihoods of indigenous communities that rely on fishing and ecotourism, while harming ocean ecosystems that play a crucial role in protecting the climate.

Greenpeace, along with our partners, is pursuing legal action to challenge this approval, and protests are ongoing across the country. Communities such as Amadiba are actively resisting, pointing to the risks of oil spills and neo-colonial exploitation. We urge everyone to join the call to stop Shell and protect these vital areas.
