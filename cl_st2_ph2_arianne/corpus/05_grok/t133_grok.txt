In the face of existential threats like the climate crisis, it's common to experience uncomfortable feelings such as fear or grief. As psychologist Dr. Susie Burke explains, these emotions are not only appropriate but can also serve as powerful motivators for action.

Drawing from Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, Dr. Burke recommends strategies to manage these feelings effectively. Start by noticing and naming your emotions, then make room for them rather than pushing them away.

One key approach is completing the stress cycle, which can be achieved through methods like physical activity, crying, engaging in meaningful conversations, spending time in nature, or sharing hugs.

Another technique involves practicing present-moment grounding exercises, such as paying attention to your senses to stay anchored in the here and now.

To combat feelings of helplessness, Dr. Burke advises acting on your core values. This might include taking steps to reduce reliance on fossil fuels, which can empower both individuals and communities.

Finally, cultivating hope and raising expectations for viable solutions can enhance personal well-being and drive collective impact in addressing the climate crisis.
