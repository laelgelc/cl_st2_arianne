Greenpeace Russia's latest research has uncovered significant public concern about air pollution in Russia's major cities. In Moscow, 82% of residents expressed dissatisfaction with air quality, while in St. Petersburg, the figure stands at 77%. The primary culprit identified by those surveyed is emissions from fossil-fuel vehicles.

In response, the Russian government, influenced by recommendations from the Human Rights Council, has put forward proposals for low-emission zones. These zones would restrict access to vehicles that fall below Euro-3 emission standards. As part of this initiative, the government has directed Moscow and St. Petersburg to create detailed roadmaps for implementation.

This development marks a breakthrough, building on Greenpeace's 2017 transport scenario. The measures are designed to reduce vehicle emissions of NO2 and CO2 by 25%, drawing inspiration from successful low-emission zone models in Europe.

For these changes to be truly effective, improvements in public transport and cycling infrastructure are essential. This step forward aligns with broader global efforts to promote green mobility.
