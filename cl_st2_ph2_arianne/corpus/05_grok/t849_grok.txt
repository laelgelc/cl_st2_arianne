Synthetic fibers offer some environmental advantages over cotton, such as using less water and avoiding toxic pesticides. However, they come with a significant downside: contributing to microplastic pollution.

According to an IUCN report, between 15% and 31% of marine plastic pollution originates from microplastics found in household and industrial products. Of that, 35% comes specifically from the washing of synthetic textiles. In Europe and Central Asia, the release of microplastics equates to about 54 plastic bags per person each week.

To address this issue, solutions involve rethinking clothing production to prioritize durability and recyclability. Consumers can also play a role by buying less, and choosing secondhand or upcycled items instead.

Polyester, which makes up 60% of clothes, produces CO2 emissions that are three times higher than those of cotton. Additionally, a single wash of polyester clothing can release up to 700,000 microfibers, which then enter oceans and the food chain.
