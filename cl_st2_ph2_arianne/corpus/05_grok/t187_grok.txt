I'm Olga Lupilina, a Russian activist with Greenpeace Nordic – Denmark, and right now, I'm out in the waters of northern Denmark, protesting against Russian oil and fossil fuels. We're blocking the tanker Seaoath, which is carrying 100,000 tonnes of oil worth $65 million from Primorsk. The EU's daily purchases of Russian oil and gas are funding the military amid the Ukraine invasion, and for me, this is deeply personal.

Greenpeace activists have been tracking and protesting tankers like this one since the war started. We can't just switch to other fossil fuels – we need to transition to renewables to achieve peace, equity, and to avoid geopolitical struggles.

I traveled 26 hours by train from Slovakia to be here, and I'm calling on politicians to halt Russian imports and accelerate a just green shift that benefits the whole world.
