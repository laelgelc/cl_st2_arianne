As a global environmental organization, Greenpeace is calling for long-term systemic change to challenge the power structures that have long dominated our world. We've seen how the corona crisis is exposing cracks in these systems, revealing their fragility and the urgent need for transformation.

In the aftermath of this crisis, we face a critical choice: we can rush to restore the broken status quo, or we can seize the opportunity to reimagine our economies in ways that prioritize the wellbeing of people and the planet.

This moment stands in stark contrast to the response after the 2008 financial crisis, which propped up polluting industries at great cost. Instead, our recovery efforts must recognize the planet as 'too big to fail.' That means committing to actions that reduce climate impact and build a green, equitable future for all.

By directing investments into green sectors, we can generate 65 million jobs by 2030 and unlock billions in economic gains. Economic recovery packages need to adhere to a 'do no harm' principle, focusing on supporting workers and facilitating just transitions—such as phasing out fossil fuels, promoting ecological farming, and advancing sustainable mobility—while refusing to subsidize polluters.
