The roots of climate science stretch back to ancient Greece, where Democritus proposed early atomic theories that laid foundational ideas about matter and energy. Fast forward to the 19th century, when Joseph Fourier first calculated that Earth's atmosphere traps heat, a concept akin to a greenhouse effect. Around the same time, Eunice Foote conducted experiments showing how carbon dioxide absorbs heat, providing early evidence of its warming potential.

Building on this, John Tyndall in the 1850s demonstrated through lab work that gases like CO2 and water vapor trap infrared radiation, explaining why the planet stays warm. By 1896, Svante Arrhenius quantified how doubling atmospheric CO2 from fossil fuel burning could raise global temperatures by several degrees, marking a pivotal moment in linking human activity to climate change.

In the 20th century, Mikhail Budyko advanced models of Earth's energy balance, predicting ice-albedo feedback loops that could amplify warming. Warnings about fossil fuel emissions causing global heating emerged early, with reports in the 1960s from the American Petroleum Institute acknowledging that burning oil and gas would increase CO2 levels and lead to significant temperature rises. Similarly, Exxon's internal studies from that era forecasted the same outcomes, including potential sea-level rise and ecological disruptions.

These scientific predictions have proven remarkably accurate, yet international conferences addressing climate change have been held since 1972, starting with the Stockholm Conference on the Human Environment. Despite this long history of awareness and diplomacy, global emissions have doubled over the decades.

This failure to curb emissions stems not from flaws in the science, but from industry deceit in downplaying risks, government failures to enact strong policies, media cowardice in confronting powerful interests, and societal desires for unchecked consumption. Additionally, oil's strategic role in military operations has often shielded the fossil fuel sector from scrutiny. Throughout this history, contributions by women scientists like Eunice Foote have frequently been overlooked, diminishing recognition of their foundational work.
