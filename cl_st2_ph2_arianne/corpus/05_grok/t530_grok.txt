Greenpeace photographer Jurnasyanto Sukarno is documenting Indonesia's forest fire crisis, which stems from clearing peatlands for palm oil plantations and results in toxic smoke. At Palangkaraya's Doris Sylvanus Hospital "Oxygen House," he witnesses a family seeking treatment for their 50-day-old baby Rafa, who is struggling with smoke inhalation. The infant is receiving oxygen and steam therapy amid emotional distress. Sukarno reflects on the plight of children lacking protective masks and families repeatedly visiting hospitals. He notes that the crisis is the worst since 2015, with no government revocation of palm oil licenses or sanctions on companies.
