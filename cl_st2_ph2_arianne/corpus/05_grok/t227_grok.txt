Veronica, a mother of two from Jakarta, has stepped forward to share her personal journey as a plaintiff in a groundbreaking 2021 lawsuit against Indonesian officials. The case accused them of failing to ensure clean air for citizens. In a significant ruling, the court found the government negligent, ordering them to establish air quality standards and develop strategies that involve public participation. However, the court stopped short of declaring the issue a human rights violation.

Reflecting on the outcome, Veronica expresses a mix of relief and ongoing anxiety about whether these mandates will be properly implemented. She points to persistent challenges in Indonesia, including deforestation, forest fires, and the loss of trees in urban areas, which continue to exacerbate air pollution.

Driven by her experiences, Veronica calls for greater public awareness to address these problems. She advocates for government transparency in handling air quality issues, along with strict sanctions against polluters. Additionally, she encourages everyday actions, such as using public transport, to help mitigate pollution. Veronica emphasizes the need to protect vulnerable groups from the health and economic impacts of poor air quality.
