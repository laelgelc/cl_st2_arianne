To avoid a climate disaster and achieve the Paris Agreement's goal of limiting global warming to 1.5°C, we must urgently transform our food systems. Farming is responsible for one-quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions, with livestock alone accounting for 14.5% of those emissions and half of all methane emissions worldwide.

The UN Food Systems Summit (UNFSS) has been dominated by corporate interests, sidelining the voices of smallholder farmers and Indigenous Peoples. Instead of addressing root causes, it promotes industry-led solutions like genetically modified chickens, ignoring the need to reduce meat and dairy production by 50% by 2050, as outlined in Greenpeace's report.

We need to amplify the voices of local communities, embrace ecological farming systems, and resist the expansion pushed by the livestock lobby. This resistance is essential to prevent further deforestation, health crises, and deepening inequities.
