The European Parliament elections are happening from 23-26 May, and it's crucial to vote to challenge authoritarian politicians and demand a fair society that protects rights and the planet. While the EU has its imperfections, it has delivered achievements such as improved air quality and bans on toxic chemicals. Collective action through the EU is essential for addressing cross-border issues like climate change.

Xenophobic parties are seeking control to restrict freedoms and accelerate climate catastrophe. Here are three key reasons to vote:

First, the EU plays a vital role in averting climate chaos within a decade.

Second, it makes decisions on pollution and systems like farming.

Third, there are threats to rights like press freedom and protest in countries including Hungary, Poland, and Spain.
