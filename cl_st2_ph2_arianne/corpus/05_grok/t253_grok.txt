In the heart of Malaysia, innovative efforts are transforming sustainable food systems while uplifting Indigenous communities. One shining example is Langit Collective, a social enterprise founded by Melisa Lim and her friends. Their mission centers on promoting heirloom rice grown by the Lun Bawang community in Sarawak.

By purchasing rice directly at farmers' doorsteps and offering prices more than double the local market rate, Langit Collective is boosting livelihoods and fostering sustainable farming methods. These include hand-harvesting techniques and reducing pesticide use, all while helping to preserve over 300 varieties of heirloom rice.

Extending their impact, the collective has created a low-cost Food Forest module tailored for resettled Indigenous families in West Malaysia. This initiative has empowered 40 households to cultivate 24 different vegetable varieties, building self-sufficiency and resilience.

The recent pandemic laid bare the fragilities in global food systems, yet it also underscored the enduring strength of traditional farming practices in weathering such challenges. Stories like these from Langit Collective inspire us to support and scale up community-led solutions for a more sustainable future.
