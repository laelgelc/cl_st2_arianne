Across North America, opposition is mounting against three major tar sands oil pipelines—Keystone XL, Enbridge, and Kinder-Morgan TMX—which are being described as "fuses" to a massive "carbon bomb" that threatens climate catastrophe. These pipelines would enable expanded extraction from the tar sands, locking in dangerous levels of greenhouse gas emissions and accelerating global warming.

Protests at the White House have drawn attention to Keystone XL, where unions, indigenous leaders, and activists have gathered to voice their concerns. They point to the environmental devastation caused by tar sands development, including the risks of spills, health impacts on communities, and the high GHG emissions associated with this dirty energy source.

In Canada, indigenous nations are rejecting the Enbridge and TMX expansions, stressing the severe risks these projects pose to their lands, waters, and livelihoods. Arrests have occurred during demonstrations, and declarations from affected groups are calling for an immediate halt to these pipelines.

By stopping these fuses from igniting the carbon bomb, we can prevent further tar sands extraction and take a critical step toward averting deeper climate crisis.
