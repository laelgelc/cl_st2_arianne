The ongoing Russian war on Ukraine, combined with the lingering effects of COVID-19 and widespread economic chaos, is fueling a surge in global food price inflation, exacerbating hunger and deepening inequality. These crises are hitting vulnerable populations the hardest, especially as they unfold against a backdrop of intensifying climate impacts.

Recent data shows a slight drop in the UN FAO food price index, but it remains 13% higher than it was last year. In some regions, local food prices have even tripled, making basic necessities increasingly out of reach for millions.

While grain shipments resuming from Ukraine provide some short-term relief, they do little to address the underlying issues in our broken global food system. This system is dominated by big corporations that profit enormously from speculation, all while contributing to the destruction of ecosystems and Indigenous lands.

To tackle these interconnected crises, we need political vigilance and greater transparency in the food sector. It's crucial to support local farmers and promote agroecology as sustainable alternatives. Implementing windfall taxes on those profiteering from the chaos, along with regulatory reforms, can help foster food sovereignty and encourage practices that are truly sustainable for people and the planet.
