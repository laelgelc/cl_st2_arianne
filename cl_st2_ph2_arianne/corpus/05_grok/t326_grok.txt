Today, on International Workers’ Day, we celebrate the incredible achievements that workers have fought for and won throughout history—things like weekends off and sick pay that many of us now take for granted. These victories showcase the resilience and collective power of workers who have banded together to demand better conditions and rights.

At Greenpeace, we stand firmly in support of workers as we push for a just transition away from polluting industries, such as fossil fuels and aviation, toward more sustainable alternatives. This transition must ensure fair treatment for everyone involved, with strong social safety nets, opportunities for re-training, guarantees of employment, and meaningful involvement from unions to protect workers' interests.

It's crucial that polluters, particularly fossil fuel companies, bear the responsibility to fund this shift. Their tactics of denial have long harmed workers by delaying necessary changes and perpetuating environmental damage.

To make this a reality, we need tailored policies that address specific needs, significant investments in green jobs, and powerful collective action from all of us. Together, we can achieve both environmental protection and social justice for workers everywhere.
