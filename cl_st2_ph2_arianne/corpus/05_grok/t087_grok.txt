In the community of Wentworth in South Durban Basin, severe air pollution from refineries such as Engen and SAPREF has created a dire health crisis. Research from the University of KwaZulu-Natal has uncovered alarmingly high rates of asthma, cancer, and leukemia among children in the area. This pollution doesn't just affect the current generation; it triggers epigenetic changes that heighten disease susceptibility for future ones as well.

Local residents, like those in Shareeza Domingo's family, endure ongoing chronic health problems alongside broader challenges including poverty, unemployment, and social issues such as violence. Activists, including Desmond D’Sa, are calling for accountability and compensation from these oil companies. These corporations have taken advantage of lax regulations and are now planning to abandon the sites, even as threats of additional drilling loom.
