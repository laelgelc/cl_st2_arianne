In the heart of Nigeria, three innovative young women—Angel Chukwudi-Denis, Fortune Mmesomachukwu Somuadina, and Favour Chinecherem Chibuike—have come together under the banner of Eco Elixirs Nigeria to create something truly remarkable: the EarthExp app. Their inspiration stemmed from firsthand experiences witnessing devastating floods in Kogi state, which were exacerbated by climate change and plastic waste.

This groundbreaking app, which has earned recognition as a Technovation award winner, harnesses the power of games, virtual reality, and social features to engage users. It educates them on key environmental trends, fosters behavioral changes, and motivates practical actions such as tree planting and water conservation to advance sustainability.

EarthExp stands as a beacon of hope, inspiring climate action in the face of Nigeria's pressing challenges like deforestation and pollution. It aligns seamlessly with broader youth-led initiatives across Africa, where young people are stepping up to build resilient communities and challenge capitalist systems that contribute to environmental degradation.
