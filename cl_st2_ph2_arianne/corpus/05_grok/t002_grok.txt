In the heart of Nigeria, three inspiring young women—Angel Chukwudi-Denis, Fortune Mmesomachukwu, and Favour Chinecherem, collectively known as Eco Elixirs—have turned personal experiences into a powerful tool for environmental action. After witnessing devastating floods in Kogi state, triggered by waste accumulation and the broader effects of climate change, they created the EarthExp app to drive positive change.

This innovative app harnesses the power of games, virtual reality (VR), and social features to encourage behavioral shifts among users. It educates people about critical environmental issues, such as plastic pollution and deforestation, by immersing them in interactive scenarios.

Through EarthExp, users can build virtual cities, make eco-friendly decisions, and earn rewards for real-world actions like planting trees. The app not only fosters individual awareness but also amplifies youth activism across Nigeria, supporting initiatives like waste reuse and campaigns against gas flaring.

By sparking these efforts, Eco Elixirs are inspiring broader mindset shifts toward a more sustainable future, empowering communities to tackle climate challenges head-on.
