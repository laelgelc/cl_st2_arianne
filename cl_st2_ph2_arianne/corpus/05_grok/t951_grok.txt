Greenpeace is excited to host the largest clothes swap party in Austria and Germany, bringing together communities across over 40 cities. With 10,000 participants expected, the event aims to facilitate the exchange of 50,000 items, highlighting practical ways to move beyond fast fashion.

This initiative is a key part of our Detox campaign, which pushes for clean textile production. By encouraging alternatives like reselling, repairing, and buying organic clothes, we're addressing the growing challenges in the industry. Clothing consumption doubles every decade, and cheap items are frequently discarded after just a few uses, ending up in landfills or incinerators.

The textile industry also contributes to freshwater pollution, particularly in places like China. To counter this, options such as renting, sharing, and swapping are gaining traction. Secondhand and eco-fashion choices are expanding, and you can find them through an interactive map that makes these sustainable alternatives more accessible.
