In the coastal province of Prachuab Khiri Khan, Thailand, a powerful story of community resistance unfolded starting in 1995, when locals banded together to oppose proposed coal-fired power plants. Residents were deeply concerned about the potential environmental impacts, the lack of transparency in the Environmental Impact Assessments, and instances of illegal land acquisition tied to the projects.

The community employed non-violent tactics to voice their opposition, including organizing protests, erecting billboards, and displaying signs throughout the area. Greenpeace Thailand joined in supporting the movement, with a notable visit from the Rainbow Warrior ship in 2000 that helped amplify their efforts.

Tragedy struck in 2004 with the assassination of movement leader Charoen Wataksorn, but rather than dampening spirits, it fueled even more intense protests. The sustained pressure ultimately led to the government's decision to cancel the coal plant projects.

Today, Prachuab Khiri Khan remains free of coal-fired power plants, with its economy thriving on fishing, farming, and tourism. This victory continues to inspire activism in the region and beyond.
