In a revealing new study titled "Dissected" from Greenpeace Denmark, we've uncovered how the meat industry is pouring millions into advertising across Europe. This massive investment aims to push back against the growing trends of vegetarianism, veganism, and flexitarianism that are gaining traction among consumers.

Through detailed analysis by semioticians, the study breaks down seven key myths perpetuated in these Big Meat campaigns. These narratives cleverly tap into people's desires for acceptance and well-being, portraying meat as a climate solution, as healthy, as masculine, as essential for good motherhood, as patriotic, as social, and as a matter of freedom.

What's particularly concerning is how these myths are designed to target vulnerable groups, including children, young adults, and parents, influencing their choices and perceptions.

To protect planetary health, it's time for public authorities to step in and regulate meat marketing. We need restrictions similar to those already in place for tobacco and alcohol, ensuring that misleading campaigns don't undermine efforts to build a sustainable future.
