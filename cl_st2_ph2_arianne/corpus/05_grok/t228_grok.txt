From 1974 to 1982, I served as a photographer for Greenpeace, capturing images and living through some of our most intense campaigns. I have photographs and memories from those years that highlight the direct actions we took to protect the environment and challenge destructive practices.

We chartered ships to confront whaling fleets on the high seas, putting ourselves between the hunters and their prey to draw attention to the slaughter. In 1975 and 1976, we disrupted Russian whalers, interfering with their operations and documenting the encounters.

Off the coast of Labrador, we worked to halt the harp seal hunts, but we also reached compromises with local and Indigenous hunters to address their concerns and find common ground.

Our anti-nuclear efforts included blocking the Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant and the Seabrook nuclear power station, where we joined forces with allies like poet Allen Ginsberg to amplify our message.

In 1981, we carried out a "test blockade" of an oil tanker, testing our tactics for interrupting fossil fuel transport.

During our voyages, we visited abandoned whaling stations, witnessing the remnants of an industry we were fighting to end.

The footage from our whale confrontations gained global media attention, spreading awareness and support for our cause worldwide.
