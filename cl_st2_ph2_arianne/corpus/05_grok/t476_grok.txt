In the heart of Kampala, Uganda, Vanessa Nakate stands as a prominent leader in the Fridays for Future movement, drawing attention to the unequal toll of climate disasters on women across African communities. These crises hit women hardest, amplifying their daily struggles in profound ways.

When floods ravage the land, they wipe out crops that families depend on, leaving women to shoulder the burden of starting food production anew. This often means trekking long distances just to secure basic survival needs for their households.

Droughts bring their own hardships, parching water sources and compelling women to haul heavy loads over vast stretches. The physical strain is immense, frequently resulting in chronic back pain that lingers as a constant reminder of these environmental upheavals.

As primary caregivers for children, women confront the fallout of these disasters head-on: homelessness that uproots entire families, deep-seated trauma from loss and displacement, and heightened vulnerabilities to physical and sexual violence in unstable conditions.

The economic ripple effects are devastating too. Losses in subsistence farming push families into desperate measures, including forcing daughters into early marriages as a means of survival.

Pregnant women face even greater perils amid these chaos, with many enduring dangers that rob them of their lives or shatter their dreams for the future.

Yet, it's women like these who are on the frontlines of climate action, and their efforts deserve our utmost respect. By advocating against climate change, they give voice to millions whose stories must be heard and acted upon.
