As climate change accelerates the melting of Arctic ice, vast areas previously shielded by frozen barriers are now opening up to exploitation by oil companies and industrial fishing fleets. This rapid transformation is putting immense pressure on fragile ecosystems, particularly around Svalbard, where destructive fishing practices pose a severe threat.

Bottom trawlers, dragging heavy nets across the ocean floor, are devastating seabed habitats. They destroy vital species such as sea pens and corals, and in the process, they risk eradicating species that may still be unknown to science. The harm extends to bycatch, which is injuring and killing near-threatened Greenland sharks caught unintentionally in these operations.

The fallout from fishing activities also endangers wildlife on land and in the water. Discarded plastic fishing gear is entangling polar bears, adding to their survival challenges in a warming world. Meanwhile, the underwater noise generated by these fleets is disrupting the communication and breeding patterns of narwhals and beluga whales, critical for their populations.

In these interconnected ecosystems, the impacts compound existing stresses from ice loss. Walruses, already struggling with diminishing sea ice, face reduced food availability due to the disruption caused by industrial fishing.

It's time to act. We must urge the Norwegian government to step in and protect Svalbard's precious ecosystem from these destructive fishing practices. By demanding stronger safeguards, we can help preserve this vital Arctic region for future generations.
