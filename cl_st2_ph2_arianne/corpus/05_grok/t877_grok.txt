In the remote Canadian Arctic town of Kangiqtugaapik, also known as Clyde River, Clara Natanine shares insights into daily life for its roughly 1,000 residents. This isolated community depends heavily on hunting marine animals such as narwhals, bowhead whales, and seals, which provide vital food sources in the face of exorbitant prices at local stores.

However, a serious threat looms from energy companies that plan to conduct seismic blasting in the surrounding waters. This activity puts local wildlife at risk and jeopardizes the Inuit cultural traditions that have been connected to the land and sea for thousands of years.

Even after enduring historical oppression, the people of Kangiqtugaapik demonstrate remarkable resilience. They are coming together to defend their rights and maintain their sustainable lifestyle, calling on others to join in the effort to halt the seismic blasting.
