After three years of dedicated campaigning by Greenpeace, our latest Southeast Asia tuna ranking reveals a significant step forward: five companies now hold Green ratings for their sustainable practices, a marked improvement from nearly zero when we began.

The report sheds light on the high regional consumption of canned tuna, where many consumers remain unaware of how their tuna is sourced. It also addresses critical ocean threats, including unsustainable fishing practices and the catching of juvenile tuna using Fish Aggregating Devices (FADs) in key areas like Indonesia and the Philippines.

Moreover, the ranking exposes troubling double standards in the industry, with companies applying stricter sustainability measures to tuna destined for export markets compared to products sold locally.

We urge consumers across the region to demand abuse-free tuna, helping to protect our oceans and push for better traceability in the supply chain.
