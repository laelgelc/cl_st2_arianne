Today marks 15 years since the passing of Greenpeace co-founder Bob Hunter on May 2, 2005. While best known for his role in establishing our organization, Bob's life extended far beyond Greenpeace, encompassing his early work as a writer and journalist. He drew profound influences from ecology, the peace movements, and media theorists such as Marshall McLuhan.

At the heart of Bob's approach was a philosophy of non-violent revolution, achieved through what he called "mind bombs"—powerful images designed to elevate ecological consciousness. This vision drove key campaigns, including protests against nuclear tests and efforts to save whales.

Bob often spoke of spirituality and the interconnectedness of nature, viewing ecology as a subversive science capable of challenging established norms. He openly shared his personal struggles, and after retiring from Greenpeace in 1977, he continued his contributions through writing books and receiving awards that recognized his enduring impact. His legacy remains a guiding force in our ongoing work for the planet.
