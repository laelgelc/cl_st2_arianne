Since 2007, the smartphone industry has produced 7.1 billion devices, each relying on over 60 different elements. This massive production has driven extensive mining and processing activities, resulting in profound environmental and social impacts around the world.

The consequences are stark. In 2014 alone, the world generated 3 million metric tons of electronic waste from smartphones and similar devices, but only 16% of that e-waste was properly recycled. Most smartphone models don't feature easily replaceable batteries, which shortens their usable lifespan to about two years in the US, exacerbating the waste problem.

Energy demands are equally alarming: manufacturing these billions of smartphones has consumed 968 terawatt-hours of energy, an amount equivalent to India's entire annual electricity supply.

Inefficient recycling practices compound these issues, as seen in high-profile cases like the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 recall, where faulty devices highlighted the flaws in current production and waste management systems.

It's time for a fundamental shift toward a circular economy model that prioritizes sustainability. We urge supporters to join petitions calling on Samsung to improve repairability and recycling in their products, helping to reduce the environmental footprint of our tech-driven world.
