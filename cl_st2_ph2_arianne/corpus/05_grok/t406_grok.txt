I recently visited Hangang Park in Korea, where I witnessed the devastating aftermath of floods from what has been recorded as the wettest monsoon season on record. The damage was severe, with the floods leading to 42 casualties, over 8,000 victims, numerous landslides, and significant agricultural losses.

Greenpeace's analysis shows that by 2030, climate change could result in 3.3 million flood victims due to rising sea levels and more frequent storms.

It's crucial for the Korean government to declare a climate emergency, commit to halving emissions by 2030, and reach net-zero by 2050. We also recognize positive steps, such as corporate commitments from companies like Apple and international initiatives like the EU Green Deal.

There is hope in collective action, and we call on the public to get involved in tackling this crisis.
