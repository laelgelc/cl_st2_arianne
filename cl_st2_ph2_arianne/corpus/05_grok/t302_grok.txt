The FSO SAFER, a massive tanker holding 1.1 million barrels of oil, remains anchored off Yemen's Hodeidah port. It has lacked maintenance since 2014 due to the ongoing conflict in the region, which is unfolding amid the world's worst humanitarian crisis affecting 24 million people.

Recent failures on the vessel include flooding, non-functional fire equipment, and a broken inert gas system. These issues are raising serious risks of a spill or explosion that could be up to four times the size of the Exxon Valdez disaster.

Such an event could devastate fisheries, reefs, desalination plants, and aid access in the area.

At Greenpeace, we are urging UN-led diplomatic efforts to enable an urgent assessment of the tanker, the transfer of its oil to a safe vessel, and preparations for spill response.
