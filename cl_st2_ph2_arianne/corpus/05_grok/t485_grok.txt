Air pollution from burning fossil fuels is putting millions of lives at risk. It increases the chances of strokes, heart disease, lung cancer, and asthma, while also fueling the climate emergency. A new study estimates that this pollution leads to 4.5 million deaths worldwide every year.

We need urgent action to tackle this crisis. That means ending the sales of new petrol and diesel cars and phasing out coal power stations. Join us by signing the petition to demand #CleanAirNow and hold polluters accountable.

People around the world are already standing up. In early 2020, protests took place in countries like Thailand, Romania, Bulgaria, Senegal, South Africa, India, Turkey, Cameroon, Indonesia, and Kenya on various dates, with images shared to spread the message.
