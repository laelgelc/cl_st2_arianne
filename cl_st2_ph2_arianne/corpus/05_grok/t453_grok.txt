Global military spending is on the rise, reaching a staggering $1.9 trillion in 2019, which marked a 3.6% increase from the previous year. This upward trend continued into 2020, with notable hikes including 5.3% in the US and 10% in Germany.

These enormous expenditures stand in stark contrast to pressing healthcare needs. For instance, the cost of a single Leopard 2 tank is equivalent to that of 440 ventilators. On a broader scale, global budgets for nuclear weapons alone are ten times the combined budgets of the United Nations and the World Health Organization.

The COVID-19 pandemic has laid bare these misplaced priorities, revealing how resources poured into militarism could instead address critical global challenges. It's time to shift away from this focus and redirect funds toward healthcare, poverty reduction, and environmental protection.

We call for reallocating budgets to these vital areas, supporting a global ceasefire, and joining the #movethemoney and #Doves4Peace campaigns to drive this change.
