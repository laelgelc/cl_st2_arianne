On May 1, the UK Parliament declared a climate emergency, a move propelled by the Extinction Rebellion protests that brought disruption to London and drew widespread support. These actions underscore the urgent scientific warnings outlined in essays such as Catherine Ingram's "Facing Extinction" and Dr. William Rees' analysis, which detail planetary biosphere shifts, runaway global heating, biodiversity loss, and the potential for human extinction. Dr. Rees examines human behavioral traits that prioritize short-term gratification, leading to an overshoot of Earth's capacity. The discussion also points to evolutionary biases and the myths of capitalist growth, while youth-led movements call for a profound societal overhaul to ensure survival, reflecting decades of ecological alerts that have gone unheeded.
