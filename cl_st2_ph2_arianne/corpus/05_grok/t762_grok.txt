In a world where our daily choices impact the planet and its people, it's crucial to prioritize trustworthy and ethical sourcing for essentials like food, wood, paper, and clothing. This means seeking out options that are free from animal cruelty, slavery, pesticides, toxic chemicals, and poor working conditions. By doing so, we can support systems that respect both human rights and the environment.

Unfortunately, powerful corporations dominate markets through subsidies and control, often relying on harmful practices such as heavy pesticide and fertilizer use, animal confinement, and soy production linked to deforestation. These methods not only degrade ecosystems but also perpetuate inequality.

The EU's free trade agreements, such as the one with Mercosur, exacerbate these issues by harming local farmers and Indigenous rights while favoring monocultures over diverse, sustainable crops. This approach undermines biodiversity and community resilience.

As individuals, we have the power to drive change. Start by carefully checking your purchases to ensure they're ethically sourced. Boycott products tied to deforestation, and hold governments accountable through letters, votes, and petitions. Use these tools to challenge and debunk the myths surrounding the benefits of free trade.

This call to action is especially urgent given the hypocrisies in global trade. Consider Trump's tariffs, the EU's own protections, and the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), which enables destructive agricultural practices. Together, we can push for a fairer system that truly benefits people and the planet.
