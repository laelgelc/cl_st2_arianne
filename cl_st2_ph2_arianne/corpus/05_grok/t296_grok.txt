Jeremy Raguain, a conservationist from the Seychelles, has penned an open letter to the leaders of Western Indian Ocean islands, calling for urgent action to address the escalating climate and ecological crisis. In his letter, he highlights the threats posed by unsustainable fishing practices, over-tourism, fossil fuel exploration, and deep seabed mining.

Raguain outlines six key solutions to tackle these issues. First, he urges a ban on fish aggregating devices and the enforcement of the polluter pays principle. Second, he recommends assessing carrying capacities before approving new hotel developments. Third, he proposes imposing a moratorium on fossil fuels. Fourth, he calls for rejecting deep seabed mining through precautionary measures. Fifth, he advocates for expanding marine protected areas, including designating the Saya de Malha Bank as a UNESCO site. Finally, he supports the adoption of a Global Ocean Treaty.

In a stark warning, Raguain states that leaders who fail to act will be replaced.
