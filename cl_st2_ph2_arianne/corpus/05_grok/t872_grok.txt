Greenpeace and Nature and Youth have filed a lawsuit in Oslo to challenge Norway's 23rd licensing round. This round granted oil companies, including Statoil, licenses for Arctic drilling, which contradicts the Paris climate agreement and Norway's constitutional environmental protections.

The case seeks to halt exploratory wells, keep oil in the ground, and safeguard the Arctic for future generations.

Supporters, including scientists, activists, and Indigenous leaders such as James Hansen, Bill McKibben, and Bunna Lawrie, have come together as 'Friends of the Case.'

We urge global supporters to add their names to show worldwide concern.
