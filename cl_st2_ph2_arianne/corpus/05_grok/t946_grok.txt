After years of litigation, Resolute Forest Products and Greenpeace entities have reached a conclusion, as outlined in our joint statement.

It's time to speak up and pressure companies to address their impacts on forests. We've seen successes with companies like Kimberly-Clark, Procter & Gamble, Hewlett-Packard, and 3M, which have adopted policies that challenge suppliers like Resolute.

Greenpeace is challenging Rite Aid, one of Resolute's major customers, to implement a meaningful paper policy. Despite our outreach, Rite Aid has ignored the links to forest destruction.

We call on the public to send messages to Rite Aid via social media.

The Boreal Forest plays a key role in carbon absorption, biodiversity, and Indigenous territories. It is threatened by Resolute's logging, destruction of caribou habitat, and operations without consent, amid an ongoing lawsuit against Greenpeace Canada.
