As the world turns its attention to the 2020 Olympics and Paralympics in Japan, the ongoing Fukushima nuclear crisis casts a long shadow over the events. Back in 2013, Prime Minister Abe assured the International Olympic Committee that the situation at Fukushima was under control, a claim that has proven far from the truth.

The reality on the ground involves immense challenges, including the management of over 1 million tonnes of contaminated water stored at the site. There's also the daunting task of dealing with 880 tonnes of molten nuclear fuel still inside the damaged reactors. Environmental contamination continues to spread, affecting soil, water, and air in the region. Workers at the site face ongoing risks, while citizens in surrounding areas deal with health impacts and broader human rights concerns stemming from the disaster.

A recent HBO documentary brings these issues into sharp focus, questioning the decision to host the games amid this unresolved nuclear crisis. It scrutinizes the Japanese government's transparency and the true state of safety for athletes, spectators, and residents.

At Greenpeace, we applaud the Olympic values of excellence, friendship, and respect. We urge the International Olympic Committee to prioritize environmental sustainability and safety in all aspects of the games. Of particular concern are radiation hotspots identified in Fukushima areas designated for events and the torch relay route.

Greenpeace will soon release results from our latest radiation surveys in the region, providing further data on these risks.
