In the vast wilderness of Siberia, forest fires are raging on a scale that's hard to comprehend—covering an area larger than the entire country of Belgium. Yet, only 9% of these blazes are being actively fought, as Russian authorities have decided the cost of tackling them outweighs the benefits. Hot, dry weather is fueling new outbreaks every day, making the situation even more dire.

These fires are putting villages at risk and threatening precious wildlife, including sables, bears, deer, and elk that call this region home. Flying over the area in a helicopter, I saw the endless taiga forest stretching out below, now transformed into charred landscapes shrouded in thick smoke that hangs heavy in the air.

What's particularly alarming is that 90% of these fires are caused by human activity, often starting near logging sites and roads. They not only exacerbate climate change but are also intensified by it, creating a vicious cycle that allows the flames to spread further. Firefighters are working tirelessly, but the blazes have grown beyond human control, with smoke drifting to affect cities far from the fire zones.
