The Gaia hypothesis presents Earth as a self-regulating living system, much like an organism that maintains its own balance. This idea draws inspiration from Greek mythology, where Gaia is the personification of Earth, as well as Indigenous concepts such as Mitákuye Oyás’in, which emphasizes the interconnectedness of all things. It also incorporates scientific perspectives from thinkers like Howard Odum, Gregory Bateson, Erwin Schrödinger, Herman Daly, Rachel Carson, Ilya Prigogine, Lynn Margulis, and James Lovelock.

At its core, the hypothesis explores how life on Earth co-evolves with its environment, including processes like waste metabolism and the maintenance of atmospheric balance. Evolutionary history provides examples, such as ancient oxygen crises, where shifts in the planet's systems reshaped life itself.

James Lovelock, a key figure in developing this concept, elaborated on it through his books, including Gaia, Ages of Gaia, and The Revenge of Gaia, among others. These works examine the profound human impacts on biodiversity and climate, underscoring the need for measures like limits to growth, support for nuclear power, population control, and strategies for adaptation to achieve sustainability.
