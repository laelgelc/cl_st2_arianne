As the COVID-19 pandemic disrupts our daily lives, we're all finding ways to cope with its far-reaching impacts. At Greenpeace, we believe in addressing these challenges through systemic solutions that foster a more equitable world, while centering community care rooted in love and compassion.

One of the most powerful ways we can support each other during this time is by coming together safely. Here are eleven practical steps to help those around us:

1. Embrace social distancing alternatives, like video calls or online gatherings, to stay connected without risking health.

2. Check in on isolated individuals, such as elderly neighbors or those living alone, to ensure they're okay.

3. Offer practical help, such as delivering shopping or essentials to those who can't go out.

4. Combat racism directed at people of Chinese descent, standing up against discrimination fueled by the crisis.

5. Appreciate and make use of government financial aid programs designed to support those in need.

6. Counter misinformation by sharing accurate information from reliable sources.

7. Suggest rent freezes to landlords to ease the burden on tenants facing financial hardship.

8. Fundraise for those affected, contributing to or organizing drives for vulnerable communities.

9. Host virtual celebrations to mark special occasions and maintain joy in our lives.

10. Share positive stories of resilience and kindness to inspire hope.

11. Prepare thoughtfully without hoarding, and remember to practice frequent handwashing to protect yourself and others.

This crisis has starkly exposed existing inequalities in our society, from access to healthcare to economic stability. That's why we're calling for no bailouts to the fossil fuel industry, which has long contributed to environmental harm. Instead, we advocate for a green stimulus that invests in sustainable solutions, helping us build a more resilient and caring society for everyone. Through these actions, we can emerge stronger, with compassion guiding us toward a better future.
