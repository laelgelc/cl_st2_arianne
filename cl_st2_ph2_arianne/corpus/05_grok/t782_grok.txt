Over the last two years, Greenpeace has faced two massive lawsuits from corporate bullies, aided by Donald Trump's law firm, aimed at silencing our activism. These Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation (SLAPPs) seek to drain our resources and hinder our efforts for a green future, with our allies also targeted. Today, Greenpeace filed a motion to dismiss one such SLAPP.

Nearly two years ago, Resolute Forest Products filed a CAD$300 million RICO lawsuit against Greenpeace defendants, despite RICO targeting organized crime, not activists. Public support grew, and three months ago, a US judge dismissed the case entirely, ordering Resolute to reimburse Greenpeace's attorney fees under California's anti-SLAPP law.
