During the lockdowns, many of us turned to simple activities like baking bread, which helped us rediscover an appreciation for life's essentials. In the midst of the crisis, various places implemented innovative responses: cities in the Philippines used e-tricycles for food distribution, Maricá in Brazil doubled its basic income program, and Barcelona suspended municipal rent payments.

Imagining cities after the pandemic, we can picture places with efficient public transport systems, abundant urban gardens, no advertisements cluttering the streets, fewer shopping malls, universal access to housing and food, and thriving community exchanges.

This vision challenges consumerism and aligns with approaches like Doughnut economics, which Amsterdam is adopting in its recovery efforts. Around the world, initiatives are underway, including the C40 cities' pledge for a green and just recovery, expansions of bike lanes in Milan, Paris, and Bogotá, and food-related projects in Freetown and Montreal.
