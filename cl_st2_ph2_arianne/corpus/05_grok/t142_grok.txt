In 1969, the Stonewall riots erupted in New York, where Trans Women, Drag Queens, and sex workers like Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia Rivera stood against oppression. Their resistance ignited a global movement for Queer rights.

Pride Month celebrates the value of non-heterosexual identities. Yet, in 71 countries, same-sex activity remains criminalized.

As a conservation worker, I urge us to recognize Queer environmental activism, especially as climate change heightens vulnerabilities. Groups like Queers x Climate exemplify this work, showing that social justice and environmental justice are inseparable.

Fifty-three years after Stonewall, let's advocate for the protection of our Earth during Pride Month.
