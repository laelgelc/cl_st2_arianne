We're thrilled to announce a monumental win for our oceans: the creation of the world's largest marine protected area in Antarctica's Ross Sea. This vast sanctuary spans 1,550,000 km², with most of it fully protected for the next 35 years. It's the culmination of years of relentless Greenpeace campaigns at the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), and it stands as a powerful victory for wildlife and all the supporters who've joined us in this fight.

This achievement comes amid a wave of recent ocean protections, including expansions in Papahanaumokuakea and the establishment of new marine monuments. Together, these steps are building momentum for healthier seas.

But we can't stop here. To truly safeguard our oceans, we need sanctuaries on the high seas through urgent action at the United Nations. Our goal is to protect 40% of the world's oceans by 2030, enhancing biodiversity and building resilience against climate change.

That's why we're calling on everyone to keep mobilizing with us—against powerful fishing interests that threaten these vital ecosystems. Your voice matters now more than ever. Let's keep pushing for the protections our planet deserves!
