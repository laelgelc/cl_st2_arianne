Greenpeace has partnered with Brazilian actress Alice Braga to launch the animated series "Countdown to Destruction." This series highlights how the industrial production of meat, dairy, soy, and palm oil is driving global deforestation, displacing Indigenous Peoples, and exacerbating the climate crisis.

We must turn this crisis into an opportunity for equality and justice by amplifying Indigenous voices.

The narrative during the pandemic that "nature is healing" must be critiqued, as it overlooks systemic issues like infinite economic growth clashing with ecosystems, particularly centered on the Amazon.

The Amazon connects to global food chains, and while individual choices matter, brands and governments must reform unjust systems.

Protecting the Amazon is essential for solving climate challenges and building a just society.
