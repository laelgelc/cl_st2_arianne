Zhao Li grew up in Beijing, where she spent her childhood observing the wonders of nature around her—cicada nymphs emerging from the soil and hens tending to their chicks. These simple encounters sparked a deep curiosity in her about the world.

Her inspiration deepened when she learned about Jane Goodall's groundbreaking work with chimpanzees, igniting her aspiration to become an environmentalist.

In 2017, Zhao joined Greenpeace East Asia as an intern and later became a researcher. In this role, she supports climate campaigns by utilizing GIS and satellite analysis.

She points out the widespread public misinformation surrounding climate change and stresses the urgent need for greater awareness. Zhao has personally witnessed the retreat of glaciers on the Tibetan Plateau since 2008.

In urban environments, it's easy to lose sight of humanity's fundamental reliance on nature. This disconnection persists amid ongoing deforestation, habitat loss, and the degradation of the Amazon, which has shifted from a carbon sink to a carbon emitter.

Even in moments of despair, Zhao finds hope by drawing on Jane Goodall's message to take action.
