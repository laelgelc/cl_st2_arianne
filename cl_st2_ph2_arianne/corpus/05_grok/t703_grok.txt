Emma Thompson recently shared a harrowing experience from her visit to an orangutan sanctuary in Kalimantan. She described a frightening encounter with one of these incredible animals, a stark reminder of the devastation caused by deforestation for palm oil plantations.

This rampant deforestation has obliterated habitats, leading to the deaths of 100,000 orangutans over just 16 years. These losses occur through shootings, starvation, bulldozing, and fires. The crisis extends beyond orangutans, putting Sumatran tigers, rhinos, and elephants at risk as well. It also inflicts suffering on local communities through land conflicts and rights abuses.

Major brands such as Unilever, Nestlé, and Mondelez committed to no-deforestation policies by 2020. Yet, they continue to purchase "dirty" palm oil, often relying on the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO), which has proven ineffective in halting the destruction.

Greenpeace is campaigning to change this, with efforts including a film narrated by Emma Thompson. We're calling on these brands to drop suppliers involved in deforestation, to protect the remaining forests and save orangutans from extinction.
