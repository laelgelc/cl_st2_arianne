In Chile, Greenpeace's Roots project teamed up with local communities, MODATIMA Women, and Finland's Sibelius Music Academy to produce "Canto del Agua," a collective song that protests water privatization. The initiative took place through a workshop in La Ligua, set against the backdrop of the country's severe water crisis, which stems from looting rather than just drought.

Musicians and activists came together to share their personal stories of family devastation, migration, and territorial destruction caused by these issues. The workshop featured activities like sound collection, rhythmic improvisation, and co-creation, fostering a collaborative environment.

The effort peaked with a concert held on World Day to Combat Desertification and Drought. Afterward, the song was recorded for digital promotion, positioning it as an anthem advocating for the de-privatization of water.
