In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, oil companies are taking advantage of the crisis to push for more single-use plastics. They're spreading misinformation as part of their efforts to secure bailouts and roll back regulations that limit their operations.

But the truth is, reusable items like cups and bags can be used safely during this time, as long as they're washed properly. This approach has been endorsed by nearly 130 health experts who confirm it's a viable option without compromising hygiene.

Contrary to what some might claim, plastic isn't inherently more sanitary than other materials. In fact, the virus can survive longer on plastic surfaces compared to cardboard.

It's also important to remember that produce should be washed thoroughly, no matter what kind of packaging it's in—plastic or otherwise.

Beyond these health considerations, single-use plastics come with serious environmental drawbacks. They contribute to widespread pollution, exacerbate climate change, and place heavy waste burdens on low-income communities that often bear the brunt of disposal and cleanup.

Ultimately, our decisions on these matters need to be guided by solid science, not the agendas of industry lobbyists.
