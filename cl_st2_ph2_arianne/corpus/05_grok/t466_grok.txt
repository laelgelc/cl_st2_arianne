The COVID-19 crisis has laid bare critical lessons that we must apply to tackling the climate emergency. Our choices in the aftermath of this pandemic will profoundly shape our society, economy, health, and the future of our climate.

As we emerge from this global health challenge, there's a real risk that polluters will seize the opportunity to ramp up emissions, pushing us further into environmental peril. Instead, we must direct financial aid toward a just and green transition. This means investing in quality jobs, robust public services, and greater equity to ensure a fair recovery for all.

What we need now are fundamental shifts in how we operate—moving toward greater compassion and cooperation. By doing so, we can build the resilience required to face interconnected crises, including those related to health, climate change, and inequality.

It's true that we've seen short-term drops in emissions during the pandemic, but these reductions will be fleeting without deliberate, sustained action. We cannot afford to tackle these crises in isolation; we must address them together, ensuring that our response to one doesn't undermine our efforts on the environment.
