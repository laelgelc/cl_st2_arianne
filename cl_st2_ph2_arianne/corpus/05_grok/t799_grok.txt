In North-West Russia, the unique Kurgalsky Nature Reserve is under threat from Gazprom's plans to build the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline right through it. This reserve is home to rare species including the Baltic ringed seal, black-throated loon, ruddy turnstone, garden dormouse, peregrine falcon, golden eagle, and a recently discovered white-tailed sea-eagle nest.

The pipeline would carve a 3.7 km scar through old-growth forests, leading to irreversible damage.

Already, over 38,000 Russians have sent letters to the Ministry of Natural Resources in opposition, and Greenpeace Russia has filed a lawsuit in the Supreme Court.

It's time to take action to stop this fossil fuel project, especially as the world moves toward renewables.
