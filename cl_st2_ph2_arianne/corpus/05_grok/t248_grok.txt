In the heart of the Amazon, Chief Puraka leads the Apurinã people in Caititu Indigenous Land, where they uphold a deep commitment to living in harmony with nature. This way of life faces severe threats from deforestation driven by agribusiness expansion, which consumes 70% of global freshwater and intensifies water crises and extreme weather events.

Such destruction-based economics inflicts harm on low-income communities, as evidenced by the low Human Development Index (HDI) in heavily deforested regions like Pará. Meanwhile, pending bills in Brazil pose a risk of legalizing land invasions and undermining indigenous rights, further endangering these communities.

Yet, viable alternatives exist, such as socio-biodiversity chains that promote managed fishing and nut harvesting. Agroforestry systems offer a path to revive traditional practices, while family farming supports inclusive and sustainable production methods.

On a broader scale, the reduction in Amazon evaporation due to deforestation contributes to continental droughts, underscoring the urgent need to protect these vital ecosystems.
