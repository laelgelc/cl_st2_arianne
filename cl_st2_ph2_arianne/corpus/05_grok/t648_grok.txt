As the new year approaches, it's the perfect time to think about resolutions that not only benefit us personally but also help protect our planet. At Greenpeace, we're all about turning good intentions into real action against climate change. Why not make 2024 the year you commit to eco-friendly resolutions that make a difference?

Start by demanding more from our governments. Push for cities designed with bike lanes and affordable public transportation, and call for phasing out fossil fuel cars to achieve cleaner air for everyone.

On a personal level, consider swapping your car for biking or public transport whenever possible. This simple switch can reduce emissions while improving your health through more active travel.

Get involved with Greenpeace by volunteering for activism efforts, such as joining marches or occupying oil rigs to challenge fossil fuel industries head-on.

Another powerful resolution: cut back on meat and dairy consumption. This helps slash greenhouse gas emissions and can boost your health by embracing more plant-based diets.

Finally, reject single-use plastics in your daily life to fight pollution, and urge companies like Coca-Cola and Nestlé to switch to sustainable packaging options. Together, these steps can drive the change we need for a healthier planet.
