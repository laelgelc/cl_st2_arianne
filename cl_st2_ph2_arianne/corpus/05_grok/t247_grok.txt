In the Philippines, the Good Food Community stands as a beacon of sustainable agriculture. Founded in 2011 by Charlene Tan, this social enterprise operates on the Community Shared Agriculture (CSA) model, linking smallholder organic farmers directly with consumers in Metro Manila. Through prepaid subscriptions, it delivers weekly boxes of fresh produce, fostering a direct connection between those who grow the food and those who eat it.

At its core, the Good Food Community promotes ecological farming methods that avoid toxic chemicals. It prioritizes soil care, crop diversity, and regenerative practices, all aimed at combating climate change and advancing food sovereignty. These approaches help build resilient food systems that respect the environment and empower local communities.

The initiative faced significant challenges during the pandemic, when supply chains were disrupted. In response, it adapted by supporting farmers and providing aid to hungry communities. It shifted its operations to focus on online orders for households, while temporarily pausing in-person events such as Good Food Sundays.

Throughout its work, the Good Food Community emphasizes trust-based relationships between farmers and consumers. By decentralizing resources, it creates pathways for sustainable livelihoods, ensuring that organic farming can thrive even in urban settings.
