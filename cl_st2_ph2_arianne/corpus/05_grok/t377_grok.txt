The deep sea holds vast genetic resources, from viruses to anti-viral mechanisms in creatures like sea cucumbers. These have inspired groundbreaking technologies such as CRISPR, which is used for treating diseases and earned a Nobel Prize in 2020.

Preserving these ecosystems offers greater long-term value than exploiting them through mining. Marine biotechnology, drawing on these resources, is projected to reach USD 5.4 billion by 2027, surpassing the USD 7 billion forecast for deep-sea mining.

Deep-sea mining poses a severe threat by destroying these fragile habitats. We urge governments and the United Nations to safeguard this "Common Heritage of Humankind" to ensure future medical advances, prioritizing lasting benefits over short-term profits.
