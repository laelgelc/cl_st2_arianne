For decades, women faced significant barriers to participating in Antarctic expeditions. Rejections were often based on unfounded assumptions, such as the lack of shops and hairdressers in Antarctica, women's supposed inability to withstand extreme temperatures, inadequate facilities, and doubts about their scientific capabilities. These exclusions persisted in some cases until the early 1980s, reflecting everyday sexism that permeated the field.

Despite these challenges, women's determination has shattered those obstacles, allowing them to take on active roles in Antarctic science and protection today.

Greenpeace is proud to showcase this progress through our Arctic Sunrise expedition, which brings together female scientists, crew, campaigners, and others. This mission is working to create the world's largest protected area—an Antarctic Ocean Sanctuary—by the end of the year. To celebrate, we've released a video in honor of International Women’s Day.
