The intertwined crises of climate change and plastic pollution are deeply connected, both fueled by fossil fuels and corporate practices. Exxon is expanding its plastic production, while Coca-Cola continues to rely on single-use plastics, even as only 9% of all plastic ever produced has been recycled.

Marian Ledesma and Graham Forbes highlight the severe impacts on communities, health, and economies in places like the Philippines and the United States. These issues demand a systemic shift away from recycling toward reuse models.

We need policies that ban single-use plastics, ensure corporate accountability, and establish a global plastics treaty. Companies such as Coke, Pepsi, and Nestlé must transition to reusables to address these crises.
