Governments around the world are pouring public money into bailing out the polluting airline industry, even as we face escalating climate disasters, the ongoing COVID-19 crisis, and deepening social injustices. Instead of propping up this high-emission sector, it's time to redirect those funds toward truly green investments that benefit people and the planet—such as expanding railways, promoting biking and walking, and bolstering public transport systems.

Aviation's CO2 emissions have been skyrocketing, increasing by 26% from 2013 to 2018 alone. This growth is fueled by unfair market distortions, including tax exemptions on kerosene and airline tickets, while railways are burdened with high taxes that put them at a disadvantage.

In the EU, airlines have received a staggering €30 billion in bailouts, often with minimal conditions attached to ensure environmental accountability or long-term sustainability.

We need a fundamental shift: drastic reductions in flights, including phasing out short-haul routes that can be replaced by cleaner alternatives. This must be paired with strong protections for workers and a just transition to support those affected, especially as we navigate the second wave of COVID-19.
