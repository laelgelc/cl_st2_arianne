At the UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, discussions are centering on the critical rights of indigenous peoples to free, prior, and informed consent—a principle frequently disregarded by the oil industry. This issue is starkly illustrated in Numto village in Western Siberia, home to Khanty and Nenets reindeer herders who are confronting severe environmental threats from oil drilling operations by Surgutneftegas. The drilling activities are causing land destruction, posing risks of spills, and leading to isolation for the community.

Local residents describe feeling like prisoners in their own land, with access restricted even for journalists and consultations that amount to nothing more than shams. There have also been retaliatory firings of officials who opposed the re-zoning efforts in the protected Numto Natural Park.
