Spain has exported arms worth €22.6 billion from 2008 to 2016, sending them to over 100 countries. Among these, 50 have been flagged as 'exports of concern' because of the risks they pose for human rights violations. This includes sales to countries like Israel, Saudi Arabia, Brazil, and Iraq.

These deals are shrouded in secrecy, which protects them and is driven by the military-industrial complex and profit motives. This persists despite the UN Arms Trade Treaty and EU regulations that aim to control such exports.

On a global scale, arms sales are on the rise, with $1.7 trillion spent annually on war, far outstripping the minimal funding allocated to humanitarian efforts.

At Greenpeace, we are calling for greater transparency in these arms deals to foster accountability and promote peace.
