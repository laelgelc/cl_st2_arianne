As we dive into Shark Week, it's the perfect time to shine a spotlight on these incredible ocean guardians and uncover some lesser-known facts that make them truly remarkable. Sharks have been swimming our seas for an astonishing 400 million years, outlasting five mass extinctions that wiped out countless other species.

Recent discoveries continue to amaze us, like the tiny American Pocket Shark, which secretes a glow-in-the-dark liquid from pockets near its fins—a natural wonder that's only just being understood.

Yet, despite their resilience, sharks face immense threats from human activities. They're often caught as bycatch in commercial fishing operations, fueling a $1 billion global trade in shark products. In the North Atlantic, for instance, mako sharks are being caught in excessive numbers, pushing their populations to the brink.

These products show up in everyday items around the world, from supplements and cosmetics containing squalene derived from shark liver oil, to pet food—contributing to the decline of shark populations everywhere.

To turn the tide, we need a strong global oceans treaty that protects the high seas, where currently only 1% of our oceans are safeguarded. This treaty would help shark populations recover and support the health of entire marine ecosystems.
