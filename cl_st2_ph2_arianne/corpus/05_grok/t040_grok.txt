The latest IPCC's 6th Assessment Report has updated the "Burning Embers" diagram, revealing that climate risks are escalating to high and very high levels at lower global warming thresholds compared to previous reports like AR5 and SR15. This update draws on new evidence about ice-sheet instability, slowdown in ocean circulation, and changes in the carbon cycle. It shows that even at 1.5°C of warming, there are high risks to extreme weather, ecosystems such as corals—which are already transitioning at the current 1.1°C level—and other systems. Since its introduction in 2001, the diagram's evolution underscores how these risks are intensifying earlier than previously thought, calling on governments and industries to take urgent action to adhere to the 1.5°C limit.
