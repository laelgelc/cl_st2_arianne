In the stunning landscapes of Patagonia, where pristine wilderness meets vibrant indigenous communities, Greenpeace activists are taking a bold stand. They're blocking trucks at an illegal dump site where oil giants Shell and Total are discarding toxic fracking waste directly onto the soil—dangerously close to residential areas and vital water supplies. This direct action comes on the heels of our investigation that exposed these practices and issued clear warnings to the companies involved.

While these communities cherish Patagonia's natural beauty as a life-sustaining treasure, oil executives see it merely as a resource to exploit for profit. But we've proven time and again that people power can triumph over Big Oil. Remember our victories in protecting the Amazon Reef, the Great Australian Bight, New Zealand's waters, the Alaskan Arctic, and halting destructive pipelines?

The latest IPCC report underscores the urgency: we're facing catastrophic climate risks if we don't act now. That's why we must keep fossil fuels in the ground. Join the global People Vs Oil movement and stand with us to protect our planet.
