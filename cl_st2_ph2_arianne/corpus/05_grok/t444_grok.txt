The COVID-19 pandemic, like SARS and avian flu before it, is a zoonotic disease that has exposed critical vulnerabilities in our global systems. One major factor is industrial animal farming, where animals are kept in cramped conditions that heighten the risk of diseases jumping from animals to humans.

This crisis also underscores how environmental degradation plays a role. Deforestation and pollution are disrupting ecosystems that serve as natural barriers against pandemics. In contrast, intact forests and oceans offer essential benefits, including clean air, protection from climate change, and valuable insights for medicine.

As we look toward recovery, it's crucial to steer clear of bailouts for industries that cause destruction. Instead, we should support green jobs and sustainable food systems. Banning the wildlife trade is another key step. Ultimately, prioritizing the health of people and the planet requires collective action from all of us.
