The 67th International Whaling Commission (IWC) meeting has just wrapped up in Florianopolis, Brazil, where deep divisions between countries continue to shape discussions on whale protection. As Greenpeace and other groups watched closely, the Florianopolis Declaration was adopted, recognizing the vital role whales play in ecosystems and reinforcing the IWC's commitment to conservation. This comes at a critical time, with whales facing escalating threats from climate change and pollution.

In a significant win for whales, Japan's proposal to weaken the 30-year ban on commercial whaling was soundly rejected. However, the push for a South Atlantic Whale Sanctuary fell short, lacking the required super-majority despite support from a majority of members.

The meeting reaffirmed the IWC's essential role in conservation, highlighting the urgent need to build momentum for broader ocean protection efforts.
