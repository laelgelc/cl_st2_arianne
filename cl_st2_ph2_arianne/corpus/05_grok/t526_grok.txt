Norway is renowned for its natural beauty and environmental respect, boasting a 97% plastic bottle recycling rate and leading the world in electric car adoption. Yet, paradoxically, it ranks as the 7th largest exporter of climate-damaging emissions through its oil production.

Despite the Paris Agreement, the Norwegian government and Equinor continue drilling for oil, ignoring scientific warnings against burning more oil. This comes amid escalating extreme weather events, such as Hurricane Dorian and wildfires in Siberia, the Amazon, and Indonesia.

Greenpeace Nordic and Nature and Youth are appealing a lawsuit that claims these actions violate Norway's Constitution Article 112, which guarantees a healthy environment.

We urge supporters to add their statements to help strengthen the case against such fossil fuel projects.
