At Greenpeace Japan, we're calling on families to make the switch to organic food as a powerful way to cut down on exposure to synthetic pesticides and help mend our broken food system. By choosing organic, consumers can drive demand that makes these options more available and affordable for everyone.

We recently conducted a study with two families who have children, where they ate 100% organic food for 10 days. Urine tests revealed a significant drop in pesticide levels in their bodies. Notably, the children started with higher pesticide levels than the adults and are especially vulnerable because their organs are still developing and they receive higher doses relative to their body weight.

To achieve a truly pesticide-free life, we recommend embracing "eco food." This means opting for food that's locally grown, seasonal, and nutritious, while also promoting biodiversity and ensuring fair pay for farmers.
