I recently traveled from Senegal to New York as a Greenpeace Africa campaigner, attending the UN negotiations at IGC5 for a global oceans treaty. My hope was for an agreement that would protect 30% of the oceans by 2030. However, the negotiations were suspended without any resolution.

In response, I addressed the delegates on behalf of over five million supporters. I emphasized how Senegal relies on fish for 70% of its animal protein and urged the protection of oceans for vulnerable communities. While there was some progress, I lamented the collapse of the talks despite the momentum that had built up.

These discussions have been ongoing for 20 years, even as species face endangerment, marine heatwaves intensify, and shark populations have declined by 70%. I am calling for the talks to resume soon so that we can finalize the treaty this year.
