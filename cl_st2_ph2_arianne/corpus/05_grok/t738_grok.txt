Greenpeace has once again ventured into the depths of the Amazon Reef aboard our ship, the Esperanza, to uncover more about this remarkable ecosystem. Battling rough seas and powerful currents, our team set out to map its true extent. What was once thought to cover 9,500 square kilometers has now been revealed by recent studies to potentially span up to 56,000 square kilometers, thriving in the deep waters where the Amazon River meets the ocean.

During our exploration, we found clear evidence of reef formations right within the blocks where Total plans to drill for oil. This directly challenges the company's assertions that no such reefs exist there, and it's led a prosecutor to recommend that Total's drilling license be denied.

Our expeditions extended into French Guiana, where we discovered that these reefs are connected across borders. This connection underscores the severe risks posed by potential oil spills, which could spread far beyond a single area and devastate this unique habitat.

Already, more than 2 million people around the world have joined us in opposing this dangerous drilling. We need your voice too—sign the petition today to help protect the Amazon Reef from irreversible harm.
