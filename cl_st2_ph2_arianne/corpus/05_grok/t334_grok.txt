Remember the iconic 1971 "Hilltop" commercial from Coca-Cola, where a diverse group of young people sang about buying the world a Coke and keeping it company? That nostalgic image of harmony and refreshment has long been a symbol of the brand's feel-good marketing. But fast-forward to today, and it's time to contrast that sunny hilltop scene with the harsh reality of Coca-Cola's massive role in plastic pollution.

Coca-Cola's reliance on single-use plastics is disproportionately harming low-income communities and communities of color around the world. These plastics contribute to climate change, health issues, and social injustice, exacerbating problems in the very places least equipped to handle them.

In 2020, Coca-Cola was named the world's worst plastic polluter for the third year in a row. The company is accused of relying on recycling myths to deflect responsibility, all while fueling an expansion in fossil fuel petrochemicals. This expansion risks driving high emissions and making it impossible to meet the 1.5°C climate goal.

It's clear that change is needed. We urge Coca-Cola to end its ties to fossil fuels, stop producing single-use plastics, and invest in refill and reuse systems to create a more sustainable future.
