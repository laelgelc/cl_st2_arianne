The transport sector in the EU is responsible for over a quarter of the region's greenhouse gas emissions, and these emissions have risen by 28% since 1990. Governments' post-COVID investments have gone into polluting carmakers and airlines, prioritizing individualism over societal good.

It's time to stop investments in airports and highways, end tax breaks for cars, ban short-haul flights where alternatives exist, invest in affordable trains, and halt sales of new combustion or hybrid cars by 2028.

Funds should be directed to trains, cycling, and public transport to achieve decarbonization by 2040, while supporting worker transitions. Take action by contacting representatives and tracking personal emissions.
