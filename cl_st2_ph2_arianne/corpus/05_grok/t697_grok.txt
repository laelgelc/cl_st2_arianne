In the 20th century, commercial whaling escalated dramatically with the use of explosive harpoons and factory ships, pushing major whale species to the brink of extinction. This pattern echoed the historical overhunting that has devastated populations of rhinos and elephants.

The International Whaling Commission (IWC) was established in 1946 by whaling nations primarily to tackle the issue of declining catches. In 1966, the IWC banned the hunting of blue whales, and by 1982, it imposed a global moratorium on commercial whaling, which took effect in 1986. This milestone was achieved in large part through Greenpeace campaigns that successfully shifted public opinion against whaling.

The moratorium stands as a pivotal victory for conservation, yet it remains vulnerable to loopholes and ongoing efforts by pro-whaling interests.

Whales play a crucial role in maintaining ocean health, contributing to carbon storage and nutrient recycling. Today, they face new threats including climate change, pollution, entanglement in fishing gear, and plastics in the marine environment. It is essential for the IWC to shift its focus from whaling debates to addressing these pressing challenges.
