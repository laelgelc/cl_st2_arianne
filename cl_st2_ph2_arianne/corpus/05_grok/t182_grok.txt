In a recent interview, Greenpeace scientist Reyes Tirado delved into the IPCC's Working Group III report, emphasizing powerful climate solutions such as renewables, halting deforestation, and shifting to plant-based diets. These approaches could halve emissions by 2030, often at low cost.

However, Tirado pointed out that current government policies risk failure, which demands urgent action to avoid an unlivable future.

She highlighted key steps, including protecting ecosystems while respecting Indigenous rights, reducing industrial livestock through dietary changes, phasing out fossil fuels, and redirecting finance to equitable solutions.

Tirado urged mobilization, protests, voting, and personal shifts like adopting renewable energy and low-meat diets to drive political change.
