As the radio operator on board the Greenpeace ship Esperanza, I've been part of our ongoing campaign to expose and challenge the destructive impact of dirty palm oil. This industry is ravaging Indonesia's rainforests, which are vital habitats for orangutans and countless other species. The forest fires set to clear land for palm oil plantations release massive amounts of CO2, create harmful smoke that affects human health, and accelerate climate change.

Our focus has been on Wilmar, the world's largest palm oil trader, which has repeatedly failed to deliver on its promises of sustainability. We've taken non-violent direct action to highlight this issue. In one action, the Esperanza tracked the tanker Stolt Tenacity all the way from Indonesia to Europe. Six activists climbed aboard the tanker, where they were detained for 33 hours before being released in Spain.

In another action near Rotterdam, Dutch activists hung banners reading "Stop dirty palm oil" from the tanker, braving resistance from the crew and freezing cold conditions. Through these efforts, we're calling on Wilmar and major brands like Oreo to take real steps to protect the forests.
