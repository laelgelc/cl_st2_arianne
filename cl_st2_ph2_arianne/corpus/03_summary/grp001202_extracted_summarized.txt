The blog post discusses the global water crisis as the top risk, driven by pollution from bacteria, toxins, and nutrient loading. It explores bioremediation using natural systems like plants, microbes, and fungi to clean contaminated water and soil, with historical examples from farming and permaculture. It covers biomimicry, inspired by nature for innovations like Velcro, but critiques its neoliberal applications that prioritize profit over restoration. Case studies include Lake Winnipeg's cattail planting, John Todd's Living Machines, Paul Stamets' mycofiltration, and the Loess Plateau's ecological rehabilitation, emphasizing natural economics and planetary boundaries.
