Filmmaker Seemab Gul documented Pakistan's 2022 floods, which affected 33 million people, destroyed homes and infrastructure, and were declared the worst in history. In regions like Balochistan, Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Sindh, she captured stories of displaced residents, activists blaming industrialized nations for climate change, and indigenous communities bearing the costs. The films highlight climate injustice, contrasting fossil fuel giants' $200 billion profits with $16 billion reconstruction needs, urging compensation from Western nations and corporations to address human-made disasters.
