The blog post highlights the crisis of plastic pollution, with a truckload entering oceans every minute, breaking into microplastics that harm marine life and contaminate water and food. It describes Earth Day actions, including sand sculptures in South Africa and six European countries, river cleanups in Kenya's Nairobi River and the U.S.'s Anacostia River, where volunteers collected data on polluting brands. Over a million people signed petitions, and volunteers worldwide pushed corporations by cleaning sites like Malaysia's Batu Caves, engaging supermarkets in Spain and the UK, educating in Senegal, and creating art in Mexico. It urges downloading the Million Acts of Blue toolkit for community action.
