The blog post uses Barbie and Ken's fictional breakup to highlight Mattel's past use of Asia Pulp and Paper (APP) products linked to Indonesian rainforest destruction and Sumatran tiger habitat loss. Greenpeace exposed APP's greenwashing and mobilized over 500,000 emails, pressuring Mattel to adopt a global policy excluding deforestation from supply chains, avoiding controversial sources, increasing recycled paper, and boosting FSC-certified wood. This adds to actions by companies like Nestlé and Unilever, urging APP to reform. It calls for donations and involvement to continue investigating and halting deforestation.
