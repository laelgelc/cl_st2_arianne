Senegalese female fish processors, like Jaba Diop and Fatou Samba, urge the government to support local communities by providing aid for cleaning processing sites amid the health crisis, rather than issuing 54 new licenses to destructive Chinese and Turkish industrial vessels implicated in illegal fishing. These licenses threaten declining fish stocks, already overexploited as per FAO assessments, exacerbating food insecurity for 40 million in West Africa, worsened by COVID-19 impacts. Artisanal fishing is restricted, limiting operations to three days a week, while industrial vessels continue unrestricted, harming livelihoods and ocean health. A petition calls for support.
