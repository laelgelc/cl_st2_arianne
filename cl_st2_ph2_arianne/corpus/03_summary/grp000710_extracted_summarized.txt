Mr. Toru Anzai, a 73-year-old from Iitate, Fukushima, was evacuated after the 2011 TEPCO nuclear disaster, initially unable to photograph due to trauma from witnessing destruction and loss. In 2012, meeting photojournalist Kikujiro Fukushima inspired him to resume, capturing post-disaster townscapes, evacuated areas, and recovery efforts in about 40,000 photos and videos. He held exhibitions in Tokyo, Fukushima, and Yamaguchi. In 2018, he demolished his dilapidated home. Now living in Date near restricted zones, Anzai documents Fukushima's "now" to preserve records for future generations, despite ongoing challenges.
