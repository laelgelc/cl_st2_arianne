The blog post discusses an Instagram #DrawThisInYourStyle challenge inviting artists to illustrate the Lost City, a unique hydrothermal vent site 750 meters deep in the Atlantic Ocean, discovered 20 years ago and resembling an abandoned metropolis. It highlights the site's scientific significance, potential clues to life's origins, and threats from deep sea mining for rare earth minerals, which could irreversibly damage its ecosystems. Artists like Quentin Blake and Charlie Adlard initiated the challenge to showcase its beauty and strangeness, urging participants to use #TheLostCityInYourStyle and #ProtectTheOceans, sign a petition for a Global Ocean Treaty, and learn about ocean protection.
