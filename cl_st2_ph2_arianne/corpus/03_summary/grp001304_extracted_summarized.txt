Greenpeace highlights the ongoing battle against illegal logging, with progress but persistent issues like corruption in producing countries. In the Congo Basin, forests are cleared for agriculture, producing suspect "conversion timber" for importers like the EU. Their report "Trading in Chaos" exposes DRC's chaotic sector, where companies like Cotrefor export illegal wood and neglect community contracts. Global Witness's "Blood Timber" reveals firms funding rebels via conflict timber to EU and China markets. Chatham House notes stagnant illegal trade despite reforms, with China as the top importer and processor, alongside growing markets in India, South Korea, and Vietnam. Enforcement of laws like EUTR and FLEGT is crucial to protect communities, biodiversity, and forests.
