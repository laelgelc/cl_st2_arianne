Victorine Che Thöner reflects on her first sea action aboard the Greenpeace ship Arctic Sunrise, protesting Shell's "red monster" FPSO headed to extract oil from the Penguins field in the North Sea. She describes feeling scared yet excited, angry at fossil fuel greed and government inaction causing avertable disasters in places like Cameroon, and worried about climate impacts on future generations. Despite seasickness, she finds elation in global resistance by communities, women, and youth demanding an end to fossil fuels, accountability for loss and damage, and a just transition to clean energy.
