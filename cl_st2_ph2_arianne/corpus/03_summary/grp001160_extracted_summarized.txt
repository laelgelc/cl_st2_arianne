MAKE SMTHNG Week promotes action against hyperconsumption, highlighting how excessive buying of food, fashion, and technology contributes to climate change, forest destruction, and ocean pollution. It criticizes waste from planned obsolescence, noting we buy twice as many clothes and wear them half as long, with repairs often costlier than replacements. The initiative urges shifting to a culture of valuing resources through repairing, upcycling, vegan alternatives, and avoiding single-use plastics. From November 23 to December 2, 2018, global events invite DIY enthusiasts to collaborate with Greenpeace and partners. Get involved via guidelines, events calendar, branding toolkit, Instagram (@makesmthng), and #makesmthng.
