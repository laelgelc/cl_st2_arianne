The Greenpeace Taiwan blog post discusses the environmental impact of discarded disposable face masks during the COVID-19 pandemic, noting their presence on coasts and beaches worldwide, including Taiwan. It estimates Taiwan used 1.3 billion masks from February to May, generating 5,500 tonnes of waste. While medical masks are properly managed, public ones fall into a grey area and are unrecyclable due to contamination risks. The post highlights risks like polypropylene degradation harming ecosystems and marine life, government efforts in education and fines, and calls for comprehensive guidelines on single-use PPE to balance health and sustainability, alongside ongoing plastic reduction advocacy.
