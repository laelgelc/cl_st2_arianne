Ezra W. Smith, who illustrated the Nothing Extra project, has created a digital colouring book for Greenpeace Russia. The illustrations are free to download, print, and colour as desired. Each one is dedicated to a Greenpeace activity or project. Users can click on the images to obtain a downloadable version for printing.
