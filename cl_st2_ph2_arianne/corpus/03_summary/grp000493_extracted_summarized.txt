Gustav Martner, former ad industry professional and now Greenpeace Nordic's Head of Creative, returned to the Cannes Lions Festival to return awards won for airlines and car companies, disrupting the ceremony to call for an EU ban on fossil fuel advertising and sponsorship. He criticizes the industry for ignoring climate crises like wars, droughts, and record heat, while awarding polluters and greenwashing. Highlighting his shift after films like An Inconvenient Truth, he notes post-Paris Agreement awards to fossil fuel campaigns and IPCC-exposed delay tactics, such as BP's carbon footprint calculator shifting blame to individuals. An ECI seeks one million signatures to push the ban.
