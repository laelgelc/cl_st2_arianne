The blog post references the film The Graduate to highlight the rise of plastics since the 1950s, now polluting oceans like the North Pacific gyre, where plastic outweighs plankton and harms marine life. It details plastic ingestion by seabirds, turtles, fish, and mammals, causing obstruction, toxicity, and up to a million seabird and 100,000 mammal deaths yearly. Solutions include global bans on single-use plastics, corporate accountability via Extended Producer Responsibility, and public water infrastructure. Greenpeace urges G20 nations to prioritize prevention, phase out throwaway items, and foster innovation.
