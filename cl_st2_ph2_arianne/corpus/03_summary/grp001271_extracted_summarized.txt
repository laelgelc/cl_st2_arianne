Greenpeace campaigns for a toxic-free future by eliminating persistent, toxic, bioaccumulative, carcinogenic, and hormone-disrupting chemicals. Hopeful signs include company transparency, REACH regulations, and substitutions in industries, though acceleration is needed. Their two-year research, conducted by the Science Unit at Exeter University, reassessed the Detox strategy, focusing on sectors like electronics, toys, cosmetics, household products, and textiles, and six chemical groups: PFCs, phthalates, heavy metals, BPA, BFRs, and APs/APEs. They compiled a list of over 17,000 potentially hazardous chemicals and analyzed supply chains, revealing widespread toxic pollution due to lack of transparency and information. The open research is shared for broader detoxification efforts.
