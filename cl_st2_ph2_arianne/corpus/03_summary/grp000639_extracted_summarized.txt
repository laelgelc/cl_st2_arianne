In 2018, Greenpeace Malaysia campaigner Heng Kiah Chun met Pua Lay Peng, a chemist leading the grassroots group Persatuan Tindakan Alam Sekitar Kuala Langat in Jenjarom, amid pollution from imported plastic waste following China's import ban. Pua mobilized community members—including drivers, lawyers, and housewives—to campaign for clean air and water, organizing meetings, fieldwork, reports, and complaints to authorities, leading to the closure of over 300 illegal facilities. Despite death threats, they expanded efforts to other areas and empowered communities. Pua advocated internationally in New Zealand and Brussels, earning a 2019 civil society award.
