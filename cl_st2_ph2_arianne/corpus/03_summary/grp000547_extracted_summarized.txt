The blog post warns of the dire risks from the abandoned FSO Safer oil tanker off Yemen's Red Sea coast, holding over 1.1 million barrels of crude oil, potentially causing devastating spills or explosions impacting human life, wildlife, fisheries, and ecosystems. It details severe effects on fishing communities, massive hazardous waste from cleanup, and health dangers from oil's toxic, carcinogenic properties affecting organs, skin, and lungs. Safety advice includes using protective equipment, coordinating with authorities, avoiding contaminated areas, and not burning waste or attempting informal cleanups. Greenpeace welcomes an oil transfer agreement but urges deploying containment booms and standby response equipment, criticizing the oil industry and calling for its end.
