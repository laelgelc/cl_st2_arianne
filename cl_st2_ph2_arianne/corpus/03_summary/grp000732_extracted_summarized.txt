Taiwan's coral reefs, home to one-third of the world's species, attract divers but face damage from climate change and pollution, causing repeated bleaching events in 2014, 2016, 2017, 2019, and this year due to rising ocean temperatures. Former Greenpeace fundraiser and current Green Island diving instructor Shrimp Roll describes massive bleaching, where symbiotic algae abandon corals, leaving skeletons; recovery is challenging. He notes warmer winters (now 23-24°C vs. 19-20°C) and urges reducing trash, phasing out fossil fuels, and supporting climate policies to protect marine ecosystems.
