The blog post highlights the devastating impact of COVID-19 in Brazil, with over 57,000 deaths, exacerbated by illegal miners invading Amazon Indigenous lands and potentially spreading the virus. It reports 9,294 Indigenous cases and 383 deaths as of June 29, per APIB, urging land protection to avert genocide. Greenpeace's May flyover documented intense mining in Munduruku and Sai Cinza lands, accounting for 60% of Amazon mining deforestation alerts from January to April 2020. Yanomami land faces over 20,000 miners. Deforestation for mining in conservation units rose 80.62% year-over-year. Greenpeace filed a complaint, leading to a lawsuit demanding miner removal by authorities.
