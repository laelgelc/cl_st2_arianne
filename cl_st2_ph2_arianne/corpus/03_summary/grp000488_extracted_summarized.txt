Emma Thompson recounts her Venice visit aboard Greenpeace's Rainbow Warrior, joining a protest dubbed the "Last Tour of Venice" to highlight climate risks like submersion from fossil fuels. She criticizes oil and gas companies for greenwashing via sponsorships in museums, universities, and sports to maintain social license. Citing successes like Harvard divesting and institutions dropping BP and Santos deals, she advocates banning fossil fuel ads like tobacco, referencing a European citizens' initiative and IPCC exposure of industry disinformation, with 450 scientists urging PR agencies to cease collaboration.
