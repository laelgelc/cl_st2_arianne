The blog post discusses the "Dare to Dream" activity at the Rebuild Indonesia Youth Festival, where Greenpeace engaged around 200 young people to visualize a better future for Indonesia without oligarchy, injustice, and environmental crises. Using MidJourney AI, participants inputted keywords like clean cities, no pollution, green spaces, safe streets, and community to generate diverse images, with artists assisting for refinement. The initiative aimed to inspire hope, imagination, and conversations about alternatives to infinite growth models, taxing oligarchs, and canceling GDP, emphasizing youth's role in co-creating a sustainable world.
