The Japanese government decided in April 2021 to discharge radioactive water from the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station into the Pacific Ocean, with TEPCO planning to dilute and release it via an undersea pipeline. Greenpeace's November 2021 survey included an interview with local fisherman Mr. Haruo Ono, who voiced deep pain over the plan's impact on Fukushima's fishing industry, citing a decade of government and TEPCO dishonesty, broken promises, and betrayal of trust. He highlighted ongoing water accumulation, potential for more storage, long-term radiation risks like tritium and carbon-14 accumulation, and threats to livelihoods, future generations, and the ocean's ecosystem, urging authorities to listen to affected residents.
