Greenpeace activists in the Indian Ocean disabled high-powered lights on the Explorer II vessel using water-based black paint to protest its fish-aggregating practices, potentially breaching regulations. The Esperanza crew has removed dozens of fish aggregating devices (FADs), supported local Malagasy fishermen, and confronted destructive fishing operations. Following the action, such lights were banned. Global efforts include factory shutdowns in New Zealand and France, laser projections in Thailand, barcode matching to FADs, and clearing Thai Union tuna from shelves in multiple countries. The campaign pressures companies like Thai Union, with more actions planned at Walmart and Sainsburys.
