Industrial fishing fleets targeting squid are decimating marine wildlife like sharks, rays, and dolphins, harming coastal communities and sustainable fishers in areas like the Indian Ocean. Greenpeace's report reveals the squid industry's rapid growth threatens global ecosystems, with vessel increases of over 800% in the North-West Indian Ocean in five years and armadas of over 500 vessels in the South-West Atlantic. International waters lack regulation, allowing unchecked industrialization. A strong Global Ocean Treaty is urgently needed to regulate fisheries, create sanctuaries, and protect oceans for climate, ecosystems, food security, and livelihoods. Nearly five million have signed a petition urging action.
