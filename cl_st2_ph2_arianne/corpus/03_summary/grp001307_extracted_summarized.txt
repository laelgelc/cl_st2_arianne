Greenpeace is hosting the largest clothes swap party in Austria and Germany, spanning over 40 cities with 10,000 participants expected to exchange 50,000 items. This event promotes alternatives to fast fashion, such as reselling, repairing, and buying organic clothes, as part of the Detox campaign for clean textile production. Clothing consumption doubles every decade, with cheap items often discarded after minimal use, leading to landfills and incineration. The textile industry pollutes freshwater, especially in China. Alternatives include renting, sharing, and swapping, with growing secondhand and eco-fashion options accessible via an interactive map.
