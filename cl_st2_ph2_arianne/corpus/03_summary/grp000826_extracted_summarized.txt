Sylvie Djacbou Deugoue shares childhood memories of playing, collecting fruits and herbs, and finding peace in Cameroon's forests, noting her birthday coincides with International Day of Forests. As a Greenpeace Africa campaigner, she fights forest destruction for monoculture plantations, which release carbon, endanger communities and species, and fail to replace natural forests' biodiversity and medicinal value. She criticizes greenwashing by industries offsetting emissions with artificial plantings, urges recognizing Indigenous rights and inclusion in policies, and laments displacement, climate changes, and lost community harmony due to logging benefiting few outsiders.
