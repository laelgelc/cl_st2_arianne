The blog post argues that a "just transition" must address not only those affected by the shift to green energy but also communities enduring the legacy of pollution from the old system, such as South Durban, South Africa, where residents face poverty, illness, and ongoing air pollution from industrial sources. It highlights research linking social determinants and pollution to amplified health risks, including in-utero effects on children's lung, heart, brain development, and neurocognitive outcomes like reduced IQ. These impacts create a generational cycle of disadvantage, persisting despite reductions in some pollutants, with Covid-19 exemplifying combined inequities.
