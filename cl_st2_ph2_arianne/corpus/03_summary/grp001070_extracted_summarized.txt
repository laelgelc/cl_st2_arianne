Greenpeace Executive Directors Jennifer Morgan and Bunny McDiarmid discuss the annual global leadership meeting, focusing on #TimesUp: Justice, Safety, and Diversity. Building on #MeToo reflections, they unanimously agreed to create reporting spaces for sexual harassment victims, establish a complaints team, and invest in trainings on harassment prevention, unconscious bias, and diversity. They aim for 50% women in senior leadership, improve global integrity systems by October 2018, and strengthen anti-harassment policies with zero tolerance for bullying, discrimination, or harassment, ensuring thorough investigations and actions. They commit to addressing equity and creating safe spaces.
