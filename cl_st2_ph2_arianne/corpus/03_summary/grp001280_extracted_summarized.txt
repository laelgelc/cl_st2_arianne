Nature lovers worldwide are urging outdoor brands Mammut and The North Face to eliminate hazardous PFCs from their gear, emphasizing that PFC-free alternatives exist for sustainability. Greenpeace calls for brands to detox now, aligning with their nature-loving values, and invites online action to demand non-polluting products. Recent protests occurred in 13 countries. The North Face plans to phase out PFCs in apparel by 2020, but this excludes other gear. Mammut claims limited PFC use and phase-out of long-chain types, yet tests revealed PFCs in all products, including long-chain in some, with slow progress on PFC-free items.
