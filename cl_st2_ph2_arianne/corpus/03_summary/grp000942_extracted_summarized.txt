Sarah North, an oil campaigner aboard the Greenpeace ship Arctic Sunrise in the North Sea, recounts her unexpected journey from London to Scotland, initially to walk her dog, leading to her involvement in protesting a BP oil rig. For ten days, activists have occupied the rig in Cromarty Firth, repeatedly forcing it to turn back and preventing BP from drilling with its only new rig this year, which would extract 30 million barrels of oil amid the climate crisis. She expresses pride in the team and hopes this action might push BP to abandon oil drilling plans.
