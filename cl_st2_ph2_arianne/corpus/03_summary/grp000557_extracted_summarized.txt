The Greenpeace ship Esperanza, meaning 'Hope,' served for over 20 years after being renamed via an online vote from its origins as a Russian fire-fighting vessel. It hosted crews and activists who confronted pirate fishing, whaling, and environmental crimes in remote areas like the Antarctic and West Africa, conducted studies, and provided aid during disasters such as the 2010 Haiti earthquake and 2012 Typhoon Bopha. As the fleet's fastest, ice-class ship, it symbolized hope but is now retired in Gijón, Spain, due to its carbon footprint, despite green upgrades, to align with a zero-carbon future; its spirit endures.
