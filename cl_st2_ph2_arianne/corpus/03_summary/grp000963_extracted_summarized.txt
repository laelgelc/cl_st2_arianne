Greenpeace Russia's research revealed widespread concern over air pollution in major cities, with 82% of Moscow residents and 77% in St. Petersburg dissatisfied with air quality, primarily blaming fossil-fuel vehicle emissions. The Russian government, prompted by the Human Rights Council, has proposed low-emission zones restricting vehicles below Euro-3 standards, instructing Moscow and St. Petersburg to develop implementation roadmaps. This breakthrough, supported by Greenpeace's 2017 transport scenario, aims to cut vehicle NO2 and CO2 emissions by 25%, following successful European models. Effective change requires enhancing public transport and bike infrastructure, as part of global green mobility efforts.
