Nature & Youth and Greenpeace Nordic, with a coalition, have filed a legal case against the Norwegian government to halt Arctic oil exploration by Statoil. Led by Ingrid Skjoldvær and Truls Gulowsen, the lawsuit invokes Article 112 of Norway's Constitution, guaranteeing a healthy environment for future generations, and demands adherence to the Paris Agreement's 1.5-degree warming limit. It highlights the contradiction of Norway's emission reduction promises amid new Barents Sea drilling plans, emphasizing the need to keep 80% of fossil fuels underground to avert climate catastrophe. This people-powered action aims to protect the Arctic and inspire global resistance against fossil fuels.
