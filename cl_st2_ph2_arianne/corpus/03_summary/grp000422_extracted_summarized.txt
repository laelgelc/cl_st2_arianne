Fana Isaac Sibanyoni, a community activist from Embalenhle in South Africa's Mpumalanga Highveld, advocates against air pollution from coal-fired power plants, refineries like Sasol, and mining activities. He engages municipalities, companies, and communities to pressure authorities for better air quality, emphasizing education and accountability to uphold constitutional rights to a clean environment. The region, a declared pollution hotspot, suffers high NO2 and SO2 levels, leading to respiratory illnesses, cancer, strokes, and premature deaths. A 2022 court ruling affirmed residents' rights, yet industries and government often ignore concerns.
