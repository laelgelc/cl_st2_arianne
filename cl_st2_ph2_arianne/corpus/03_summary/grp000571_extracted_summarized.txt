Greenpeace highlighted activists' courageous efforts in 2021 amid the pandemic and climate crisis, including blocking a fossil gas vessel in Spain, protesting a sunken gas rig in Croatia, urging fossil fuel phase-out in the US, and women demanding climate justice in Vanuatu. At COP26, protests targeted greenwashing, with global actions calling for bolder measures. Other efforts included painting a plane in France to denounce aviation greenwashing, projecting on a German power plant, Indigenous land demarcation in Brazil, and an "oligarchy monster" installation in Indonesia. Thanks were given to supporters, with images in the media library.
