Greenpeace mourns the deaths of Homero Gómez and Raúl Hernández, Mexican activists killed within days of each other for protecting monarch butterfly habitats in Michoacán from illegal logging. Gómez managed a sanctuary, while Hernández was a tour guide. These murders exemplify a global pattern of violence silencing environmental defenders, amid threats like climate change and persistent logging corruption. Targeted killings occur weekly in Latin America, as seen in Nicaragua. Greenpeace demands justice, solidarity, and effective protection for land defenders worldwide, highlighting unequal risks for frontline activists.
