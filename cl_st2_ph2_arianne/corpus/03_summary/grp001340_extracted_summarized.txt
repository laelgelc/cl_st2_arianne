Zara, the world's largest clothing retailer, committed to eliminating all hazardous chemical discharges from its supply chain and products by 2020, with PFCs phased out by 2015, following nine days of intense public pressure from Greenpeace's Detox campaign. This includes transparency measures, with 100 suppliers in the Global South disclosing chemical release data by 2013. The campaign involved global actions, social media engagement with over 43,800 Twitter mentions, and protests at Zara stores. Zara joins brands like Nike and Adidas in detoxing, but more companies must act to stop toxic pollution from clothing production.
