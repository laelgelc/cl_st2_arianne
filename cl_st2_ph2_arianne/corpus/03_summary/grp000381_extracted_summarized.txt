Danicley de Aguiar, a Greenpeace Brazil campaigner, traveled from Pará, Brazil, to South Korea to highlight how illegal gold mining threatens the Amazon rainforest and Indigenous Peoples like the Kayapó, Munduruku, and Yanomami. Over 36 years, mining has destroyed over 200,000 hectares, with hydraulic excavators accelerating damage in Indigenous Territories. A Greenpeace investigation found 176 excavators operating illegally there from 2021-2023, including 75 from Hyundai's Brazilian subsidiary, sold via nearby dealers. This activity spreads diseases, mercury contamination, and deforestation, worsening biodiversity loss and the climate crisis. Hyundai should use monitoring technology to prevent such use and protect the Amazon.
