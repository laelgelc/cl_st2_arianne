The author, who moved to Australia from a landlocked country at age 13, describes the natural wonders of the Great Australian Bight, including Point Labatt Lookout where endangered Australian sea lion pups play and learn, and their fragile breeding sites sensitive to disturbances. She highlights leafy sea dragons, camouflaged in seagrass but endangered by pollution, and the ancient granite formations of Murphy’s Haystacks. As an ocean photographer, she warns of threats from oil drilling and seismic blasts by Statoil, which could harm sound-reliant marine life like dolphins and cuttlefish, and shares images from her explorations.
