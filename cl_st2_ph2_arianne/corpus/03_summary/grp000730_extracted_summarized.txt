The blog post highlights the deep sea's vast genetic resources, including viruses and anti-viral mechanisms in creatures like sea cucumbers, which inspired CRISPR technology for treating diseases and earning a 2020 Nobel Prize. It emphasizes that preserving these ecosystems is more profitable than mining, with marine biotechnology projected to reach USD 5.4 billion by 2027, far exceeding mining's USD 7 billion forecast. The post warns that deep-sea mining will destroy habitats and calls on governments and the UN to protect this "Common Heritage of Humankind" for future medical advances rather than short-term profits.
