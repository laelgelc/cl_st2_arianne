Greenpeace CEE, partnering with Ukrainian organizations like Ecoaction, Ecoclub, and Victory of Ukraine, reconstructed a war-damaged hospital in Horenka near Kyiv by installing a heat pump with 65-meter ground probes and a hybrid solar power system. This enhances energy independence, reduces CO2 emissions, cuts heating costs by 80%, and covers up to 60% of energy needs, with a €56,000 cost recouped in 6-7 years. The project exemplifies "Build Back Better" principles, avoiding outdated systems, and aims to partner with European cities for similar sustainable reconstructions amid Ukraine's recovery.
