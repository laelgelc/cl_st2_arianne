Isra Hirsi, a 16-year-old Minneapolis student, co-leads the US Youth Climate Strike inspired by Greta Thunberg, with strikes planned for March 15 in 47 countries and nearly all 50 states. Involved in activism since first grade, she started seriously in high school through her school's green team and MN Can’t Wait coalition, motivated by the Flint crisis and Line 3 pipeline. The youth-led movement, dominated by young women of color, demands urgent climate action like the Green New Deal. Striking means risking education for real change, despite the stress, as young people organize and adults must confront discomfort.
