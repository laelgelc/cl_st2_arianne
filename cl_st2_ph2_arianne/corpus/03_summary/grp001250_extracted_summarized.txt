On May 18, 2016, Norway granted new Arctic drilling licenses to 13 oil companies, hailed as a "new chapter" by the petroleum minister despite industry setbacks like Shell's withdrawal, halved Norwegian production, and plummeting oil prices. This contradicts recent global warming limits from the Paris Agreement and a Norway-US Arctic sustainability deal. Chevron's CEO views warming as beneficial for gas production. Civil society groups, including Greenpeace, seek a constitutional review for environmental rights, potentially leading to court action, offering hope for a shift to renewables over Arctic oil.
