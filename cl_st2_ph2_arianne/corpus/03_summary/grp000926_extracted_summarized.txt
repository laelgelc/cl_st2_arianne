The Greenpeace blog post debunks three myths promoted by deep sea mining companies: first, that it's a "green" solution for clean energy like renewables and electric vehicles, when it could worsen climate change by releasing stored carbon from seabed sediments; second, that it avoids human rights abuses in land mining, though it risks harming ocean-dependent communities and environments; third, that seabed minerals are essential for tech like smartphones, unsubstantiated by the IT sector. Instead, it advocates a circular economy with recycling, reduced metal use, and leadership from tech giants to protect oceans.
