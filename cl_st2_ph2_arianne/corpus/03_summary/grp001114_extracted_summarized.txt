The blog post urges action on the shipping industry's climate-polluting emissions, which have evaded strict regulations due to lobbying and lack of scrutiny. It highlights the IMO's April meeting in London as a key opportunity to adopt a high-ambition plan to phase out emissions by 2050, with Greenpeace collaborating with NGOs. Divisions exist among IMO members, but solutions like slower speeds, carbon-free fuels, and wind-assisted propulsion are available. The post cites shipping's major emissions contribution, equivalent to a top global emitter, and calls for public support via sharing a Facebook page to push for cleaner shipping and meet Paris Agreement goals.
