Fifty years ago, a small group sailed from Canada to protest a nuclear bomb test on an Alaskan island, inspiring global action and founding Greenpeace. The post pays tribute to early members who transformed it from a local, predominantly male, white group into a diverse, global organization tackling root causes of environmental destruction. Achievements include whaling moratoriums, halting nuclear testing, the Antarctic Treaty, and banning sea dumping. Amid climate change and biodiversity crises enabled by profit-driven structures, it calls for unprecedented unity and action, drawing hope from past movements to demand a green, peaceful future.
