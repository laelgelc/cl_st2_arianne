Greenpeace's blog post discusses a global brand audit revealing multinational corporations' role in plastic pollution, with one truckload of plastic entering oceans every minute. Through 10,000 volunteers in 42 countries auditing 187,000 pieces of trash across 239 cleanups, top polluters identified include Coca-Cola (found in 40 countries and top three on six continents), PepsiCo, Nestlé, Danone, Mondelez International, and Procter & Gamble. It criticizes companies for using disposable plastics, urges systemic change and corporate responsibility, notes consumer efforts, and calls for sharing photos of branded litter with #IsThisYours to pressure brands.
