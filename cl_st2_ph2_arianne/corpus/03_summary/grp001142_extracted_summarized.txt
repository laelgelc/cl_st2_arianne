Jennifer Morgan, Greenpeace International's Executive Director, reflects on attending Davos to speak truth to power and appeal to corporate leaders' humanity amid climate crises. She promotes the "Justice for People and Planet" report, analyzing 20 cases of corporate exploitation through legal loopholes, tax treaties, and regulatory capture, harming human rights and the environment—examples include VW's dieselgate, SLAPP suits by Resolute and Energy Transfer, Glencore's pollution, and ACS's role in Guatemala's Renace project. The report proposes Corporate Accountability Principles, urging liability for violations and prohibiting abroad what is banned at home. Morgan highlights extreme weather as a top global risk, linking it to climate change and corporate responsibility.
