The first session of UN negotiations for a Global Plastics Treaty (INC-1) ended in Uruguay on December 2, 2022, focusing on procedural matters amid calls for binding rules to address plastic pollution's impacts on human rights, biodiversity, and climate. Greenpeace attended to advocate for a strong treaty covering plastic's full lifecycle, from production to disposal, with global control measures to cut production and eliminate false solutions like chemical recycling. Positive developments included regional urgency, coalitions for just transitions, and human rights objectives, but industry lobbying and procedural delays hindered progress. The next session is likely in Paris in May 2023.
