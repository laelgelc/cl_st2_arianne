Wildfires in southeast Siberia, Russia, have devastated Zabaikalsky krai, destroying homes, farms, and livestock, injuring 34 people, and causing one death, prompting a state of emergency. Greenpeace Russia's firefighting team, led by Grigory Kuksin, delivered humanitarian aid including burn-treatment bandages, supplies for firefighters, and essentials like clothes and food to affected remote families. Kuksin described scenes of smoldering ruins, burnt prairies, and rapid fire spread by strong winds, often starting from arson.
