Greenpeace emphasizes the vital role of forests in sustaining life and campaigns for their protection on International Day of Forests. Forests absorb and store nearly 300 billion tonnes of carbon, while deforestation accounts for 12% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Extinction rates have surged up to a thousand times in recent centuries and could rise further without action. Tropical rainforests host 70% of plants with anti-cancer properties and provide about a quarter of conventional medicine drugs. Corporations like Procter & Gamble must address forest destruction in supply chains, and governments enforce protections. Over 10,000 people are using #StandForForests to advocate.
