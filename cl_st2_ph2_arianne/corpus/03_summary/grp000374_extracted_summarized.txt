The Free Land Camp in Brasília gathers thousands of Indigenous Peoples annually to demand government recognition of their lands, with the 19th edition from April 24-28. Demarcation, a constitutional right, protects territories from invasions, preserving livelihoods, cultures, and forests. However, only 30.8% of claimed areas are recognized, with 871 of 1,393 lands pending action. Invasions by loggers and miners, including illegal gold mining using excavators, devastate regions like Yanomami, Kayapó, and Munduruku, causing environmental destruction, mercury contamination, and violence. Indigenous land protection is crucial for global biodiversity and climate balance.
