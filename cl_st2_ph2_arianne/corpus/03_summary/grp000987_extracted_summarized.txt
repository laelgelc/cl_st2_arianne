The blog post describes how Vale's dam collapse has contaminated the Paraopeba River with toxic mud and heavy metals like nickel, mercury, lead, zinc, and cadmium, rendering 40 km of the river dead due to high turbidity and lack of oxygen. Locals, including couple Jair and Conceição, have abandoned fishing there, opting for an artificial dam instead. Residents express deep sadness over the loss of fish species and the river's beauty. The city of Pará de Minas declared an emergency as the river is its water source, profoundly altering community routines.
