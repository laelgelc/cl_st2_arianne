Greenpeace's Rainbow Warrior sailed to the Clarion Clipperton Zone in the Pacific to witness and expose the risks of deep sea mining by companies like The Metals Company and GSR. They observed GSR's 25-tonne prototype machine disconnect and get stuck on the seabed during tests, along with sediment clouds from seafloor disturbance. Activists, including Fijian Victor Pickering, protest the industry's threats to ocean wildlife, Pacific livelihoods, and carbon storage amid climate change. Greenpeace painted "RISK" on GSR's vessel and calls for a Global Ocean Treaty to create sanctuaries, urging millions to join in opposition.
