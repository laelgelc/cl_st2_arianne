The Dvinsky Forest, one of Russia's last Intact Forest Landscapes in Europe, hosts eagle-owls, wolverines, brown bears, and rare species, but faces destruction from logging. Certification schemes like FSC and PEFC fail to protect it, allowing companies market access while sourcing from intact areas; FSC's Motion 65 for protection is at risk, and PEFC lacks support. A 2001 Greenpeace campaign halted core logging via agreements, but companies like Arkhangelsk Pulp & Paper Mill, ICE Titan, Solombalales, and Region-Les now pressure authorities to resume, potentially erasing the forest in a decade without formal protection. Greenpeace urges loggers, authorities, and FSC to safeguard this vital part of the Great Northern Forest for biodiversity and climate.
