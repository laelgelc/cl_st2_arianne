The blog post criticizes carbon offsetting as a scam and greenwashing tool that allows companies and governments to continue polluting while claiming emission reductions through projects like forest protection, which commodifies nature, harms Indigenous communities, and distracts from actual cuts. It describes net zero as a deceptive bookkeeping trick relying on offsets, ignoring the need for immediate fossil fuel reductions, and advocates for 'real zero' emissions instead. Offsetting is portrayed as a con driven by greed, feigning compassion, preying on fear, and exploiting uncertainty, with calls to reject it at COP26 and under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement.
