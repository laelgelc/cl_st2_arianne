The blog post discusses the Paris Agreement's goal to limit global warming to 1.5°C, requiring radical changes across industries. While the electricity sector advances with renewables supplying over 20% of EU power, transport emissions rise due to increasing car sales, especially SUVs.

Norway exemplifies rapid EV growth through incentives, aiming for zero-emission cars by 2025. It advocates broader solutions like bike lanes, affordable public transport, and car sharing for sustainability.
