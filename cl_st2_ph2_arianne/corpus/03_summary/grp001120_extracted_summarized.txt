The International Seabed Authority (ISA) is finalizing regulations for commercial deep sea mining, despite claims that minerals are needed for renewables being refuted by reports showing terrestrial resources suffice. Mining risks severe, permanent environmental damage like habitat destruction and biodiversity loss. The ISA lacks transparency, rejected an environmental committee, and approved 28 exploration contracts covering vast areas. Opposition grows, including local resistance to Nautilus Minerals' Solwara project in Papua New Guinea, an EU Parliament moratorium call, and 800,000 supporters urging a ban to protect unexplored ecosystems.
