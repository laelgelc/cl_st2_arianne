Will McCallum, head of oceans at Greenpeace UK, shares experiences witnessing destructive industrial fishing in the Indian Ocean, including bycatch of dolphins, rays, and sharks, and struggles of fishing communities facing declining stocks. While veganism aids planetary health by reducing fish consumption, it's not a full solution, as billions rely on oceans for food and livelihoods. Greenpeace advocates for a Global Ocean Treaty to protect 30% of oceans by 2030, sustainably manage the rest, and combat industrial fishing through actions like challenging tuna companies, preventing bottom trawling, and supporting fishers' rights, emphasizing solidarity with vulnerable coastal communities.
