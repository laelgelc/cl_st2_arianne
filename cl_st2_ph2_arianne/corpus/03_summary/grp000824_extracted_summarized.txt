In a letter, Greenpeace leaders Jennifer Morgan and Anabella Rosemberg emphasize that choices during the COVID-19 crisis will shape the climate emergency, urging investment in public and planetary health for a just transition rather than planet-wrecking industries. They call for vigilance against exploitation and the 'shock doctrine,' advocating a cooperative, egalitarian future in harmony with nature. The virus demands community and compassion, not blame, with a focus on protecting the vulnerable and learning deep lessons. Personally, they share family challenges, highlighting acts of courage and the need to prioritize care while remaining vigilant.
