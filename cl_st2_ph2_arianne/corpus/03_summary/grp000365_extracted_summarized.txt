The Brazilian Amazon's rich biodiversity is being destroyed by illegal gold mining, which pollutes rivers with mercury and sediments, reducing sunlight, disrupting fish hunting and respiration, and affecting spawning in headwaters. Excavators accelerate this damage. A 2022 Greenpeace expedition studied unstudied areas, highlighting unknown species and soil microorganisms vital for medicine and agriculture. Mining expands via 320 airstrips on Indigenous lands, clearing vegetation, and miners hunt animals like monkeys and capybaras, compromising seed dispersal and pollination, while competing with Indigenous Peoples for food. A new forest-preserving development model is urgently needed.
