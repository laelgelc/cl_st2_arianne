The blog post criticizes fossil fuel companies for "gender-washing" on International Women’s Day, March 8, by sponsoring events, running promotions, tweeting about women's careers or gender gaps in tech, and sponsoring cultural activities to improve their image. It compares this to greenwashing, where they falsely appear environmentally friendly. The post argues that these companies' core activities—extracting, transporting, processing, and burning fossil fuels—cause pollution, spills, and climate breakdown, disproportionately harming women through environmental damage, extreme weather, and increased vulnerability to gender-based violence. It urges them to stop if they truly care about women's rights.
