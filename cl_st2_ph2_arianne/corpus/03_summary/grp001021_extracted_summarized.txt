Waya Maweru, a Greenpeace volunteer from Indonesia, describes the devastation of rainforests cleared for palm oil plantations, endangering species, exploiting communities, and causing issues like the 2015 fires. She and other activists have boarded a Wilmar-owned ship carrying dirty palm oil to Europe, protesting the company's role in deforestation and human rights abuses. Brands like Oreo promised clean palm oil but failed to deliver. Maweru urges action to halt further destruction and calls for support to pressure Wilmar and buyers for sustainable practices.
