The blog post links ecological damage in South Africa's South Durban Industrial Basin, particularly in the polluted Wentworth community, to increased gender-based violence and femicide (GBVF), exacerbated by climate change rooted in patriarchal colonialism. It highlights how pollution from factories and refineries aggravates gender inequalities, poverty, and risks to womxn and girls, with male-dominated employment perpetuating economic disparities. The author calls for an intersectional approach, integrating just energy transitions into GBVF policies to achieve SDGs and dismantle systems of oppression.
