The blog post discusses pygmy blue whales, a tropical subspecies of blue whales in the Indian Ocean, which are smaller and lighter than Antarctic blue whales. It highlights how commercial whaling decimated whale populations, leading to recent discoveries of subspecies and the realization of their vulnerability due to specialized habitats. Threats include ocean noise, ship strikes, habitat destruction, and climate change. Whales play a key role in ecosystems and combating climate change. The post calls for global ocean sanctuaries to protect them, referencing the 1986 whaling ban and Greenpeace's Arctic Sunrise expedition, urging public support.
