The blog post highlights the global shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy, questioning if it's fast enough to avert climate catastrophe. It criticizes Samsung Electronics for its mere 1% renewable energy use and slow plan to announce a strategy by August 2018, contrasting this with its quick Note7 recall. In South Korea, the government aims for 20% renewables by 2030, and the 2018 Winter Olympics will be 100% renewable, yet sponsor Samsung lags. A survey shows 85% of Koreans want companies to go fully renewable. The post urges Samsung to embrace renewables swiftly to avoid being on the wrong side of history and calls for petition signatures with #DoBiggerThings.
