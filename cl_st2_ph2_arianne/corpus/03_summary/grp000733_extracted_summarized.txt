Greenpeace International, along with 350 organizations, denounced the FAO's recent agreement with CropLife International, a lobby for pesticide and genetically engineered seed corporations like Bayer, BASF, and Syngenta. The agreement aims to transform agri-food systems, promote rural development, and boost farmer resilience to climate change through investment and innovation. Critics argue it empowers profit-driven multinationals, granting them undue legitimacy and control over global food systems, while ignoring agroecology, food sovereignty, and recommendations from the 2009 IAASTD. The post urges FAO to prioritize ecological farming over corporate interests for a healthy planet.
