The blog post discusses the conclusion of the first UN meeting on a Global Ocean Treaty to protect high seas, covering nearly half the planet and facing threats from industrial fishing, pollution, and climate change. It highlights the need for a strong treaty by 2020 to enable ocean sanctuaries, with Greenpeace campaigning against industry lobbying and urging public involvement. An upcoming opportunity is creating an Antarctic Ocean Sanctuary, backed by nearly 2 million people. Greenpeace actions included protests with banners, inflatable turtles, and origami deliveries. Support varies, with some nations pushing for ambition while others lag.
