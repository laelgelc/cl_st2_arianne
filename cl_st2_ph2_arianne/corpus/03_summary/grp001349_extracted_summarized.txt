Greenpeace criticizes Mattel for using packaging linked to Indonesian rainforest deforestation, satirically dubbing Barbie's new "career" as 'Rainforest Destroyer' and launching a contest to design her look. The post highlights similar issues in supply chains of Hasbro, Disney, and Lego, urging all toy companies to commit to suspending purchases from Asia Pulp and Paper until it halts deforestation, and to adopt strong sustainable procurement policies. It calls on supporters to message Mattel, share a revealing video, engage on social media, and join the contest for a prize.
