2018 is declared the climate year amid fires, soaring temperatures, hurricanes, and IPCC confirmation of a changing world worsening ahead. The Climate Vulnerable Forum’s Virtual Summit, hosted by the Marshall Islands, showcases leadership from vulnerable developing countries, including the Marshalls' plan for 100% renewables and net-zero emissions by 2050. The CVF, comprising frontline nations, influenced the Paris Agreement and 1.5-degree goal. This online summit precedes COP24, urging major polluters and governments to act urgently on climate change.
