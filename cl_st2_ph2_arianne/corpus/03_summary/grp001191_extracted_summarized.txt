The blog post criticizes Canadian government decisions on declining caribou populations, deeming them outdated and ineffective. In Quebec, the Val-d’Or herd is being relocated to a zoo, abdicating responsibilities under recovery plans and the Species at Risk Act (SARA). In British Columbia, wolf culling targets symptoms rather than habitat destruction from poor forest management. Despite SARA strategies and studies highlighting risks, little action has been taken. It urges immediate application of science and Indigenous knowledge, stronger habitat protection with First Nations input, and public action via petitions to implement recovery strategies and safeguard boreal forests.
