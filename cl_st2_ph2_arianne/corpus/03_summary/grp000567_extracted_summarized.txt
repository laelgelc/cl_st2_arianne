The blog post urges accelerating the shift to reuse and refill systems to combat plastic pollution, driven by global pressure and supported by policies. It highlights the Ellen MacArthur Foundation's report on insufficient reuse ambition in the consumer goods sector, and the World Economic Forum's initiative uniting stakeholders for reuse policies. Scaling reuse offers environmental and economic benefits, potentially saving 27.1 million tonnes of resources in food and beverage by 2030. It calls for a binding Global Plastics Treaty to reduce plastic production and promote reuse, citing progressive laws in Austria, France, Portugal, Romania, Spain, Chile, India, and Indonesia.
