The blog post discusses rewilding as a solution to ecological crises, drawing from Isabella Tree's book on transforming Knepp Estate from a struggling farm into a wild habitat. Inspired by ecologist Franz Vera, owners introduced free-roaming herbivores like cattle, pigs, ponies, and deer, fostering soil restoration, biodiversity revival—including rare insects, butterflies, birds, and orchids—and trophic cascades. It highlights animals' role in habitat creation, critiques intensive farming's soil erosion, emphasizes healthy soil's microbial composition, and advocates letting nature self-restore, with examples like Yellowstone's wolf reintroduction.
