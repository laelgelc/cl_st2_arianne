The blog post explores finding hope amid ecological crises, arguing that logic and big institutions like governments or corporations offer little, as global capitalism and pre-ecological politics fail to address overshoot. Instead, hope lies in nature's long timescales, wildness, and humility; in simple, local communities restoring habitats; in artists inspiring change; and in modest, persevering people. It draws on figures like Rachel Carson, Wendell Berry, and Leonard Cohen, emphasizing patience, persistence like spawning salmon, and returning to indigenous, place-based living over hubristic management.
