Greenpeace Japan urges families to switch to organic food to reduce synthetic pesticide exposure and fix the broken food system, emphasizing that consumer demand can improve availability and affordability. A study involved two families with children eating 100% organic for 10 days; urine tests showed significant pesticide level decreases, with higher initial levels in children, who are more vulnerable due to developing organs and higher doses per body weight. For a truly pesticide-free life, it recommends "eco food," which is locally grown, seasonal, nutritious, promotes biodiversity, and ensures fair pay for farmers.
