Greenpeace's Pole to Pole voyage documented ocean wonders and threats from climate change, overfishing, plastic pollution, and deep-sea mining, advocating for a UN Global Ocean Treaty to create sanctuaries. Expeditions visited the Antarctic, revealing penguin declines due to krill scarcity; the Amazon Reef, confirming whale breeding; the Sargasso Sea, highlighting plastic-trapped wildlife; and the Lost City vents, facing mining risks. They produced the film "Turtle Journey," confronted fishing vessels, conducted research on turtles and sharks, and urged global action amid disappointing UN negotiations.
