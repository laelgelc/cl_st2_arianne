Greenpeace celebrates Pride month by waving its rainbow emblem of hope and diversity, honoring its LGBTQ+ crews and supporters. The post highlights queer diversity in ocean creatures, noting that human concepts like sexuality apply loosely to animals, where prejudice is absent. Examples include young male orcas engaging in male-on-male sex; bisexual seahorses with males giving birth; female albatross pairs raising young; hermaphroditic starfish and sea urchins; wrasses that change from female to male; and clownfish that shift from male to female. It emphasizes shared complexity with marine wildlife and much more to discover.
