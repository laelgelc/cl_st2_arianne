In 2013, the 'Arctic 30'—28 Greenpeace activists and two journalists—were jailed for two months in Russia after protesting Gazprom's Arctic oil rig on the Dutch-flagged ship Arctic Sunrise, which was seized in international waters. Released on bail and amnesty, they filed a case in March 2014 with the European Court of Human Rights, alleging unlawful detention and violation of freedom of expression. The Netherlands won a related case in 2017, but individual rights remain unresolved. On 12 July 2018, the Arctic 30 submitted arguments, supported by NGOs ARTICLE 19 and Media Legal Defence Initiative, requesting a hearing; no decision date is set.
