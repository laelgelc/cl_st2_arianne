In a three-part animated series by Green Future, Greenpeace's climate education project, teenagers Sunny and Ho adventure in a 2100 world where climate change erodes natural wonders. They visit "The Last Tree" exhibition featuring rare butterflies, flowers, and fruits; explore a flooded underwater city while following sea otters; and reject meat at a restaurant, envisioning land devastation from industrial farming. The series also depicts a hopeful future with solar- and wind-powered cities and plant-based choices, urging action to secure a better path for the planet and generations ahead.
