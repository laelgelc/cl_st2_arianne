One year after the 2020 Norilsk diesel spill in Russia's Arctic, Greenpeace Russia highlights ongoing oil accidents, including recent leaks in Komi Republic and Nenets region, and maps Arctic oil storage facilities for transparency. They welcome Rostekhnadzor's inspections but demand more monitoring, phasing out fossil fuels, and a shift to renewable energy. Referencing a 2018 presidential decree on aging infrastructure, Greenpeace notes Norilsk Nickel's historic 150 billion ruble compensation. As Arctic Council chair, Russia has an opportunity for a green economy via the proposed Russian Green Deal, creating jobs and reducing spills.
