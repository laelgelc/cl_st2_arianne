Greenpeace's German office ranked supermarket chains on their Detox commitments, labeling Rewe/Penny, Tchibo, Coop, Edeka/Netto, Norma, Metro/Real, Interspar, and Migros as "Detox Losers" for not committing to eliminate harmful chemicals from textile supply chains by 2020. In contrast, Aldi and Lidl are "Detox Trendsetters," banning toxics, publishing discharge data, and starting recycling programs. Kaufland joins as the 33rd brand, committing to detox by 2020, increasing durable and recyclable clothing. Trendsetters focus on product lifecycle, including take-back programs and fabric reuse to reduce environmental impact. Consumers are urged to return clothes to accelerate recycling.
