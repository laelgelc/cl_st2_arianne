Greenpeace's campaign targets Thai Union, the world's largest canned tuna company, to reform the destructive seafood industry plagued by forced labor, illegal fishing, ocean destruction, and untraceable supply chains. After two years of activist and consumer pressure, Thai Union is engaging with Greenpeace and considering major changes: reducing destructive fishing, minimizing labor abuse, tackling illegal fishing and overfishing, and ensuring full traceability. These shifts could force industry-wide improvements. A video featuring internet cats, mermaids, sharks, turtles, and activists urges immediate, sweeping reforms. Thai Union owns brands like Chicken of the Sea and supplies Walmart; supporters are called to demand action.
