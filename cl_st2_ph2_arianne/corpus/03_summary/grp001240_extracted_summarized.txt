Greenpeace highlights the fashion industry's progress toward toxic-free production by 2020, noting initial commitments from Adidas, Puma, and Nike, while others resisted. Over 70 brands, representing 15% of global textile production, have committed to Detox, proving it's feasible. The Detox Catwalk ranks 19 companies: H&M, Zara (Inditex), and Benetton lead as "Detox Avant-Garde" with chemical bans and transparency. However, 16 brands, including Nike and Victoria’s Secret, lag in "Faux Pas" or "Evolution Mode." Greenpeace urges faster action and plans to reassess progress, while eyeing sustainable post-growth models beyond mass production.
