Khairiyah Rahmanyah, an 18-year-old fisherman's daughter from Chana district in southern Thailand, leads protests against a proposed industrial zone that would convert 26.8 square kilometers of seaside into facilities for heavy industries, threatening local marine resources and communities. Influenced by her father's activism in the Thai Sea Watch Association, she has faced police intimidation, arrests, and surveillance while using social media like Facebook Live to amplify the Save Chana movement. Inspired by Greta Thunberg, Khairiyah persists in advocating for environmental protection, delaying public hearings through persistent actions, and dreams of studying psychology to benefit her hometown.
