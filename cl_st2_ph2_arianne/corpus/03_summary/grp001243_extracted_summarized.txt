The blog post describes the failure of OSPAR nations in Tenerife to establish an Arctic sanctuary, with Norway, Denmark, and Iceland refusing negotiations, leaving the region vulnerable to destructive fishing and oil drilling. Volunteer deckhand Paloma recounts her firsthand experience aboard the Greenpeace ship Arctic Sunrise, sailing from Svalbard to uncharted northern waters, where she witnessed stunning ice formations, glaciers calving, snow-capped mountains, and wildlife like seals and birds. Overwhelmed by the Arctic's beauty, she contrasts it with her prior campaigning against oil companies, urging others to raise their voices for protection.
