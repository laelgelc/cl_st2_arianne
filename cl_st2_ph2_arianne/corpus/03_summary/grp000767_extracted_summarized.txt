In Russia's Bashkortostan, the sacred Shihan Kushtau, a unique limestone mountain with rare species, faces mining by the Bashkir Soda Company for outdated soda production using limestone. Local activists protested, forming camps and human chains against tree cutting and fencing. Police raided the camp on August 15, detaining 80, beating protesters, and damaging journalists' equipment. Despite violence and misinformation, protests led to the republic's head promising to halt activities for dialogue. Greenpeace Russia filed complaints, demands protected status for Kushtau, activist releases, and sustainable tech shifts.
