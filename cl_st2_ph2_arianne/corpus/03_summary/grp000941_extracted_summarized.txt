The removal of Amsterdam's iconic 'Iamsterdam' sign in 2018 shocked tourists and locals, drawing global media attention. The post draws a parallel to the disappearing Amazon rainforest, repurposing the sign as 'Iamazonia' to highlight deforestation and express solidarity with Indigenous Peoples who have long protected the forest and depend on it for survival. It criticizes Brazil's Bolsonaro government for promoting industrial exploitation through agriculture, mining, and logging, leading to increased invasions, violence against communities, and global climate risks. The post urges worldwide support to safeguard this vital planetary landmark.
