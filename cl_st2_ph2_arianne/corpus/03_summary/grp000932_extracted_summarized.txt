Professor Gretchen Früh-Green recounts discovering the Lost City hydrothermal vent field in 2000 by chance during a seafloor mapping expedition on the ship Atlantis. She describes its awe-inspiring white cathedral-like structures, geysers, and colorful life at 800 meters depth, a unique site in the Atlantic that sustains itself for thousands of years and may reveal insights into Earth's formation and life's origins. Expressing protectiveness, she warns of unregulated deep-sea mining's potential dust, noise, and unknown chemical impacts, urging a Global Ocean Treaty to safeguard such vulnerable ocean wonders from destructive industries.
