The blog post marks the fifth anniversary of the Rana Plaza factory collapse in Bangladesh, where 1,138 workers died producing clothes for brands like Mango, Primark, and Walmart, exposing unsafe conditions in fast fashion. It highlights the Fashion Revolution movement's fifth year, running April 23-29 in 100 countries, demanding sustainable, safe, and transparent fashion. Greenpeace's Detox My Fashion campaign has led 15% of the global textile sector to commit to eliminating hazardous chemicals. The post addresses environmental strains like water use, chemicals, and microfibre pollution, urging actions such as upcycling, swapping clothes, attending events, watching "True Cost," reading reports, contacting brands and politicians, and sharing #whomademyclothes on Instagram.
