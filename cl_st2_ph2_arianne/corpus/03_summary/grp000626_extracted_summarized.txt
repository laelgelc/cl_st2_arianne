The blog post criticizes fossil fuel companies for using soft power through sponsorships and influence to greenwash their reputations and maintain their climate-damaging business models. Examples include Ineos and Total sponsoring rugby events, Shell funding museum exhibitions with non-criticism clauses, and ExxonMobil supporting arts while denying climate science. It highlights industry efforts in education, like Total's influence at École Polytechnique and oil-sponsored school programs, and sports like Gazprom's UEFA partnership. The post calls for ending fossil fuel advertising and sponsorships to accelerate a green transition, noting growing divestment and youth reluctance.
