Greenpeace has integrated creative activism and art into its mission for 50 years, starting with painting peace and ecology symbols on the Phyllis Cormack's sails for its first voyage against U.S. nuclear testing in Amchitka, which led to the cancellation of future tests. Over time, artists worldwide have contributed through music, designs, and protests. Swiss artist Harald Naegeli, known for spraying stick figures in Zürich from 1977-1979, faced arrest, exile, and jail before returning in 2020. He donated drawings for Greenpeace's 50th anniversary auction, inspiring the global Hope through Action mural project in 12 cities to encourage public involvement via petitions, letters, or protests.
