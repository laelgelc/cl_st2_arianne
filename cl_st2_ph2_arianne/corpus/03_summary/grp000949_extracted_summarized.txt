The blog post emphasizes the urgency of addressing the climate crisis within a decade by phasing out diesel and petrol vehicles, highlighting that Europe's transport sector contributes over a quarter of CO2 emissions, with 45% from roads. It outlines six policy measures from research by the Ecologic Institute and Greenpeace Germany: banning internal combustion engine sales and mandating EV production quotas; expanding subsidized charging infrastructure; adapting incentives to market trends; using mixed policies like subsidies and mandates; taxing polluters while incentivizing EVs; and clearly communicating benefits. EVs are part of a broader shift toward reducing personal cars and boosting renewable-powered public transport, cycling, and walking.
