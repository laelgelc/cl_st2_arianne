The blog post discusses Kenyan smallholder farmers challenging unconstitutional laws that prohibit sharing, exchanging, or selling uncertified seeds, punishing offenders with up to two years in prison or a KES 1,000,000 fine, favoring multinational corporations amid a broken global food system. It highlights three activists: Nasike, leading Greenpeace Africa's Seed is Sovereign campaign to protect seed sovereignty and support the Kenyan court case; Darcise Dolorès, a Cameroonian environmental law student and Greenpeace volunteer, applying the South African rooibos case to safeguard Indigenous palm oil access; and Delwyn, a South African activist coordinating Greenpeace volunteers and founding Food Connect Durban to promote local sustainable food and heirloom seed saving, aligned with global movements.
