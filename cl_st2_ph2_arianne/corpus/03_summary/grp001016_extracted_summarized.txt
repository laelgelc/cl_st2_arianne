A Honduran court convicted seven men, including a military official, assassins, and DESA employees, for the 2016 murder of Indigenous activist Berta Cáceres, who opposed the Agua Zarca megadam. Despite the verdict, the trial faced barriers like lack of transparency and exclusion of her family. Berta's daughter Laura decried the injustice and vowed to continue fighting. The post highlights that her killing is part of a global pattern, with 207 environmental defenders murdered in 2017, many Indigenous women. It calls for justice against the masterminds and protection for defenders, urging shares with #JusticeForBerta.
