The blog post criticizes "fortress conservation" for evicting Indigenous Peoples and local communities, leading to abuses like harassment and murder by eco-guards in places like the Congo Basin. It calls for discarding this colonial model to prevent injustices in meeting 30x30 biodiversity targets, warning against offsets that enable corporate greenwashing. Instead, it urges respecting Indigenous rights, leadership in protected areas, and systemic changes to combat corporate greed and inequality. Successful examples include community-led protections in Mexico and Brazil, emphasizing that true harmony with nature requires supporting biodiversity guardians.
