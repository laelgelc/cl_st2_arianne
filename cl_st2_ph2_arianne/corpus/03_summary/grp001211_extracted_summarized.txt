The blog post discusses Greenpeace's Ocean Defenders Campaign, where the ship Esperanza documents plastic pollution in the North Pacific garbage patch, highlighting toothbrushes on Kahuku beach. It explains plastic's longevity—lasting over 500 years—with all produced pieces still existing, forming ocean debris larger than France that harms wildlife, including birds using it for nests. Plastic damages the planet from fossil fuel extraction to toxins and sea life impacts. The post traces plastic's history from a 19th-century ivory substitute for billiard balls, advanced by mass production and WWII, leading to postwar consumer boom. It urges reducing use through actions like reusable bags and avoiding microbeads.
