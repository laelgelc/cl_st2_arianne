Eric Darier joined the "We are fed up" march against agribusiness in Berlin on January 17, noting a large turnout that highlighted widespread concern for food production and its origins. He was surprised by Germany's strong food movement, akin to North America's. The post critiques food system failures, including pesticides, genetically engineered seeds, industrial animal farming, pollution from fertilizers, weakened protections via TTIP/CETA, and threats to bees. It emphasizes hope from people adopting organic, low-meat diets, buying local, gardening, and joining food justice groups. Darier urges readers to connect with local farms and movements for better food systems.
