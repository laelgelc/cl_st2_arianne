The blog post highlights how the Russian war on Ukraine, COVID-19, and economic chaos are driving global food price inflation, hunger, and inequality, disproportionately affecting vulnerable populations amid climate impacts. It notes a recent drop in the UN FAO food price index, still 13% higher than last year, with local prices tripling in some regions. Grain shipments from Ukraine offer short-term relief, but the broken food system is dominated by big corporations profiting from speculation while destroying ecosystems and Indigenous lands. It calls for political vigilance, transparency, support for local farmers and agroecology, windfall taxes on profiteers, and regulatory reforms to promote food sovereignty and sustainable practices.
