HD Hyundai Construction Equipment has pledged to halt sales of heavy machinery in Amazonas, Roraima, and Pará states, cease maintenance and parts supply, and terminate a dealership contract to prevent its excavators from aiding illegal gold mining in Kayapó, Munduruku, and Yanomami Indigenous territories. This follows a Greenpeace report revealing 176 excavators in these areas from 2021-2023, with 43% from HD HCE, the most popular brand among miners. Greenpeace campaigns, including press conferences and demonstrations, pressured the company. The decision is a victory for Indigenous peoples, but other manufacturers and the Brazilian government must also act to eradicate illegal mining.
