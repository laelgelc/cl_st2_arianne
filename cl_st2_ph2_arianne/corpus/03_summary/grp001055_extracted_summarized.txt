Greenpeace supporters helped convince Samsung to announce in June its initial steps to shift production lines from fossil fuels to renewables, offering hope amid global extreme weather. This aligns with South Korea's transition from nuclear and fossil fuels. Greenpeace East Asia outlined specific actions for Samsung to power factories in China, the US, and Europe with renewables, urging expansion to South Korea and Vietnam, and sent a report to company leaders. Facebook committed to 100% renewable energy globally by 2020. Greenpeace aims to push more companies toward renewables.
