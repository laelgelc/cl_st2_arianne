US President Obama announced the world’s largest ocean sanctuary, and governments are meeting at the UN to develop a treaty for protecting the high seas, where less than 1% is currently protected. Scientists recommend at least 30% protection to revive marine life, rebuild fish stocks, and combat climate change. Governments committed to 10% by 2020, but most lag behind. Greenpeace is advocating for strong sanctuary rules. Key benefits include quadrupling biomass and biodiversity, boosting economies through tourism and fisheries, and enhancing climate resilience via carbon storage. More work is needed for a robust UN deal.
