Supporters from countries like Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Mexico, the US, UK, Germany, Netherlands, Australia, and Colombia called Samsung, receiving mixed responses on disposal plans, from destruction to recycling or no information. Greenpeace Korea protested at Samsung's HQ, urging CEO Kwon Oh-hyun to rethink product design and reuse materials. Over 30,000 signed a petition; calls to action include signing, calling Samsung, and sharing.
