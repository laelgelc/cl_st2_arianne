The Vital Ocean Voices series shares stories from Indian Ocean coastal communities on impacts of destructive fishing, pollution, and climate breakdown. In Seychelles' Anse Royale, the Watershed Committee, including Terence Vel and Monica Samson, restores mangrove wetlands through a 2016 program involving nurseries, community planting, and workshops. This Ecosystem-Based Adaptation effort combats flooding, supports biodiversity, filters pollution, and aids fishing livelihoods. Community engagement fosters ownership, increasing mangrove species from three to six despite past destruction from settlement and development.
