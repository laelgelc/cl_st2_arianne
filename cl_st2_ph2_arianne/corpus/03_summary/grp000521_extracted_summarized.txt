The blog post commemorates the 50th anniversary of "The Limits to Growth," a 1972 book by MIT scientists presenting 12 scenarios on ecological risks from unchecked growth, not specific predictions.

Updates confirm unsustainable consumption, with quotes from authors like Donella Meadows emphasizing overlooked interventions and ideological attacks from limitless-growth advocates.
