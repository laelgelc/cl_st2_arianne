Families have launched petitions, websites, and pickets; supporters include Nobel laureates, leaders like Angela Merkel and Hillary Clinton, and organizations sending 1.5 million emails and gathering a million signatures. The Netherlands seeks their release via the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea. It frames them as heroes in a history of non-violent resistance, criticizing Russia's overreaction and frivolous charges like piracy and hooliganism, which may bolster the climate movement.
