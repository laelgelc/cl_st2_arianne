The blog post discusses the WHY PLASTIC? three-part documentary series by THE WHY Foundation, highlighting plastic's role in a major environmental crisis amid confusion and misinformation. It critiques reliance on recycling and self-regulation, urging big brands like Coca-Cola—named the top plastic polluter—to shift from single-use packaging to reuse and refill models. "The Recycling Myth" exposes recycling's failures, including waste export, incineration, bribery, fraud, and greenwashing in a multi-billion industry. "Coca-Cola’s Plastic Promises" uncovers Coke's flawed 'World Without Waste' strategy. The campaign aims to raise awareness, reaching over 100 million people worldwide.
