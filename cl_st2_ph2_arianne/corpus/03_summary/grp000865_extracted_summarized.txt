The Amazon faces record deforestation, with 9,762 km² destroyed from August 2018 to July 2019—a 30% increase and the highest since 2008, per INPE data. President Bolsonaro's anti-environmental policies have weakened protections, cutting IBAMA inspections by 22% and fire-fighting budgets by 38%, while dismissing INPE's director amid raging fires. Indigenous rights are violated, exemplified by the murder of guardian Paulo Paulino Guajajara. Deforestation warnings rose 100% from August to October 2019. Urgent action is needed: support forest guardians and reject deforestation-linked beef and soya.
