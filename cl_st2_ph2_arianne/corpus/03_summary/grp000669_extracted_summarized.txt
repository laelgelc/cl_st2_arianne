The blog post criticizes deep sea mining as a destructive industry threatening deep ocean ecosystems, despite existing scientific evidence of long-lasting damage. It argues the precautionary principle should halt mining, faults the ISA for prioritizing economic interests over environmental protection, and accuses companies like DeepGreen and GSR of greenwashing through "minesplaining" and false claims of climate benefits. It rejects the false choice between ocean and land mining, promotes resource efficiency and a circular economy instead, and urges support for a Global Ocean Treaty to protect oceans from exploitation.
