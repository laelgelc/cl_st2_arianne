The blog post criticizes law firm Gibson Dunn & Crutcher for its history of sanctions due to fabricating evidence, lying, and legal misconduct while defending corporations like Chevron. It details how Gibson Dunn used SLAPP suits and RICO claims in a New York court under Judge Lewis Kaplan to attack Ecuadorian pollution victims, their lawyer Steven Donziger, and the Ecuadorian judiciary. Allegations include judicial bias, waived privileges, bribed witness Alberto Guerra (who admitted lying), and trial irregularities. Despite Kaplan's ruling against the victims, foreign courts ignore it, and SLAPP suits threaten free speech.
