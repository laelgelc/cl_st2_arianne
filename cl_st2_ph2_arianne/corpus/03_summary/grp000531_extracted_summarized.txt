Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has exposed energy system vulnerabilities and accelerated a global food crisis, exacerbating food insecurity, especially in the climate-vulnerable MENA region, which relies heavily on Ukrainian and Russian grain imports. This conflict disrupts supply chains, raises food prices, and worsens issues like water scarcity, reduced crop yields, and humanitarian crises in Yemen. Fossil fuels further threaten food security, such as via the FSO Safer tanker. The text calls for shifting to resilient, local, sustainable food systems based on food sovereignty, ecological farming, and community initiatives, while demanding climate justice from rich nations.
