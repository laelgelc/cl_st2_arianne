Greenpeace Argentina, alongside allied organizations, filed a class action lawsuit against the government's approval of Equinor's seismic exploration in the Argentine Sea, citing unconstitutionality and risks to marine life and coastal communities. This sparked the #Atlanticazo movement with widespread protests. The Federal Court in Mar del Plata issued a precautionary measure suspending the project indefinitely, emphasizing the need for transparency, citizen participation, compliance with the Escazú Agreement, and a proper environmental impact assessment addressing cumulative effects and the precautionary principle. The ruling highlights dangers like oil spills and ecosystem harm, marking a victory for public action amid ongoing climate concerns.
