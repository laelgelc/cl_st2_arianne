The blog post criticizes fossil fuel companies like Shell, Total, and Eni for using glossy ads and sponsorships with images of rainbows, happy cows, and wildlife to greenwash their image. Volunteers from Greenpeace and other groups documented over 100 examples in 40 European cities via the interactive #BanFossilAds map, which allows uploading photos and details to expose manipulative strategies. Examples include sponsorships of cultural events by companies like Acea, Lexus, Plenoil, and Endesa. This tactic aims to gain social acceptance and block climate action. Director Adam McKay advocates banning such ads like cigarettes. The post urges using the map's toolkit, documenting claims, and signing the European Citizens’ Initiative for a ban, needing 1 million signatures.
