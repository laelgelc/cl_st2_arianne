In 2015, seven million people halted Shell's Arctic expansion, followed by the Paris climate agreement, signaling a shift from fossil fuels to sustainability and environmental protection. The post urges signing a declaration to #savethearctic. It highlights Arctic warming at twice the global rate, record low January sea ice, and melting enabling destructive trawling in the Barents Sea, risking habitats, bycatch, and ecosystems like coral reefs (30-50% damaged in Norway).
