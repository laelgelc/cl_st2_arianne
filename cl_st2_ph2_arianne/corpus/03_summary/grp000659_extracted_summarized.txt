The Covid-19 pandemic highlighted the vital role of urban green and public spaces for health and well-being, offering relief from stress and reconnection with nature. Benefits include enhanced brain development and cognitive function in children, reduced risks of non-communicable diseases like cardiovascular conditions and diabetes, lower mortality from pollution and inactivity, improved pregnancy outcomes, better perceived general health, and shorter hospitalization times. Green spaces also support mental health by lowering stress, depression, and anxiety. Urban civic spaces provide similar advantages. The 3-30-300 Rule promotes accessible greenery to combat climate change and biodiversity loss, with calls for equitable urban greening by authorities.
