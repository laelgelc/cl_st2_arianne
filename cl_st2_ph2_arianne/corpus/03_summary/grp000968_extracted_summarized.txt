Greenpeace responds to Nestlé's statement on reducing single-use plastics, following a petition signed by over 3 million people. Nestlé pledges to cut single-use plastics, introduce reusable packaging like Häagen-Dazs ice cream containers and dispensers for NESCAFÉ, MILO, and water, and aim for 100% recyclable or reusable packaging by 2025. Greenpeace criticizes the lack of transparency on plastic production volumes, insufficient scale of reusable initiatives, overreliance on recycling (only 9% effective), and absence of plans to reduce overall single-use packaging, urging genuine reductions for a waste-free future.
