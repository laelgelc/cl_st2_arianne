Cabo Pulmo, a coral reef in Baja California Sur, Mexico, hosts diverse marine life including fish, crustaceans, mollusks, birds, and mammals, many at risk. Threatened by overfishing and irresponsible tourism 25 years ago, local communities organized, leading to its 1995 declaration as a National Marine Park. Fish populations rose over 400%, and migratory species like whale sharks, mantas, humpback whales, turtles, and sharks returned. Communities shifted to ecotourism. In 2008, Hansa Urbana's "Cabo Cortés" project threatened the area with pollution and habitat destruction, but campaigns with Greenpeace, including a 220,000-signature petition, led to its 2012 cancellation. The post highlights people power and urges protecting 30% of oceans via sanctuaries and a Global Ocean Treaty.
