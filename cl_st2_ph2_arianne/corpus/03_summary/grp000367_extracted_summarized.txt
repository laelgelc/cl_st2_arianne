The blog post highlights how throwaway plastic destroys the world by harming health, accelerating social injustice, destroying biodiversity, and fueling the climate crisis. It advocates a human rights-based approach prioritizing health, environment, and justice for affected communities. Greenpeace demands a Global Plastics Treaty to keep oil and gas in the ground, end relentless plastic production, and phase out single-use plastics for a safer future. It warns of industry and government efforts to weaken the treaty, but emphasizes building a global movement for an ambitious agreement by 2024 that caps production, phases out virgin plastics, and ensures a just transition to a zero-waste economy.
