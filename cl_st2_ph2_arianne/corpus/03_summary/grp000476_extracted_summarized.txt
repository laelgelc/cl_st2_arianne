The Amazon rainforest is shrinking due to deforestation and intentional fires, driven primarily by agribusiness and meat consumption, which convert 75% of deforested public lands to cattle pastures. These illegal fires, often started by land grabbers, threaten Indigenous peoples, biodiversity, and global climate, with a 52.9% deforestation increase under Bolsonaro's anti-environment policies. Fires rose 16.7% in early 2022, pushing the forest toward a tipping point where 20-25% loss could transform it into a savanna. Solutions include enforcing laws, creating protected areas, recognizing Indigenous rights, and reforming the global food system to prevent destruction.
