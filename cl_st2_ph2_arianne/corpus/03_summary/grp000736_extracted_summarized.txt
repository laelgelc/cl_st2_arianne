The 2020 MV Wakashio oil spill in Mauritius leaked 1,000 tonnes of fuel into a lagoon near a marine reserve, harming communities and marine life. Such disasters underscore the need to ban dangerous fuels in fragile areas like the Arctic and shift shipping from fossil fuels. However, the IMO has backtracked on 2018 commitments to cut emissions aligning with the Paris Agreement, ignoring the climate emergency despite shipping's 1 billion tonnes of annual CO2 equivalent—more than twice the UK's emissions. A strong Global Ocean Treaty in 2021 is urged to enhance governance, accountability, and prioritize conservation over exploitation.
