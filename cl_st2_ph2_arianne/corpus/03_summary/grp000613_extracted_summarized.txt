Cristiane Mazzetti, a senior forest campaigner at Greenpeace Brazil, describes her week-long trip with a team to document Amazon fires and deforestation enabled by Bolsonaro’s government, starting in Porto Velho. Recent rain briefly cleared heavy smoke that obscures the sky and impairs air quality. Interviews with health experts from Fiocruz, Agevisa, and a children’s hospital revealed fires' severe impacts on public health, particularly for children and the elderly, with pollution spreading far via wind. Residents endure annual smoke, low humidity, and nearby fires, threatening livelihoods. This is the first in a series on deforestation, logging, and land grabbing.
