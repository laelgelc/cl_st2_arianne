Greenpeace activists worldwide protested retailers this week, from Colombia to Hong Kong, Canada to Switzerland, demanding an end to single-use plastics and investment in refill and reuse systems, emphasizing there's no "away" for throwaway items. Actions included demonstrations, in-store protests, and petition deliveries. The Reuse Revolution involves people globally replacing single-use plastics with reusables, with over 5 million urging companies and governments to act against plastic pollution. Companies offer false solutions like paper or bioplastics and flawed recycling. Retailers must remove single-use plastics, commit to refill systems, and drive change with brands.
