West African women fish processors, facing job losses from expanding fishmeal factories, gathered in Dakar on World Fisheries Day to protest. These factories process fresh fish into meal for animals in Europe and Asia, threatening livelihoods, food security, and marine ecosystems while contradicting UN sustainable development goals. In Senegal, fisheries provide over 600,000 jobs and 70% of animal protein needs. Women urge the government to halt new factories, stop using edible fish for meal, and support their businesses with refrigerating units instead, as artisanal processing creates far more jobs than factories.
