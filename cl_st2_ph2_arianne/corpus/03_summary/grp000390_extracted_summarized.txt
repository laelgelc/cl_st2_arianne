Quack Pirihi, an Aotearoa activist of Ngāpuhi, Ngāti Wai, Ngati Porou, and Ngāti Whatua o Kaipara heritage, attends the ISA conference in Jamaica with Pacific activists aboard Greenpeace’s Arctic Sunrise to address Indigenous stakes in deep sea mining. She emphasizes cultural connections to land and ocean, warning that mining exacerbates colonization's impacts like incarceration, mental illness, and systemic failures, hindering healing and liberation. Guided by ancestors, she advocates for solidarity, presence in international spaces, and playful protest. Without proper protocols like karakia and karanga, outsiders undermine mana and intrude. Papatūānuku can cleanse, but mining threatens livelihoods and Māori identity tied to the moana.
