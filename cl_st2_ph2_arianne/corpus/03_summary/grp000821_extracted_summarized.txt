In the face of the coronavirus crisis, the authors urge redirecting public funds from planet-destroying industries toward public health, planetary well-being, and a just transition to a harmonious future by 2030. They warn against the "shock doctrine" exploiting workers and call for accountability from leaders, emphasizing community, cooperation, and compassion over blame or division. Choices should protect the vulnerable, learn deep lessons, and foster an open, egalitarian, peaceful world. Amid personal challenges, they highlight acts of courage and the need for vigilance, as crises make the impossible possible.
