The Acampamento Terra Livre, the world's largest Indigenous gathering in Brasília, was canceled due to COVID-19, as Indigenous Peoples from Brazil demand government protection of their rights and lands. Despite isolation, communities face virus risks from illegal invaders like miners and loggers, with ten deaths reported, including a Yanomami boy, echoing historical disease devastations. Additional threats include Amazon fires causing respiratory issues and mercury contamination from mining. Under Bolsonaro, FUNAI funding cuts and policies have doubled deforestation alerts and heightened forest destruction in Indigenous territories, endangering lives, the Amazon, and the climate. The pandemic exposes systemic vulnerabilities, urging governments to prioritize people and the planet.
