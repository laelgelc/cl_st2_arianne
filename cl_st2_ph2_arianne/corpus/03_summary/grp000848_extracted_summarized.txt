Greenpeace cofounder Dorothy Metcalfe passed away on December 10. A seasoned journalist, she managed radio communications and media outreach during the 1971-1972 campaigns against U.S. and French nuclear tests at Amchitka and Moruroa, pressuring leaders like Pierre Trudeau and arranging an audience with Pope Paul VI. With husband Ben, she turned a French deportation into a publicity coup. Born in 1931 in Winnipeg, she became a dedicated peace activist, helping launch Greenpeace through innovative tactics like billboards and boat protests. A Celebration of Life is scheduled for February 18 in West Vancouver.
