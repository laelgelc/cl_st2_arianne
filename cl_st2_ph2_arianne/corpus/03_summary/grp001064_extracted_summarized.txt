The blog post discusses an updated Census of Earth’s Biomass, revealing humanity's disruption of species diversity through habitat loss, deforestation, and extinctions. Plants dominate over 80% of global biomass, mostly terrestrial, while animals comprise just 0.37%, with arthropods accounting for half of animal mass. Humans and livestock make up 96% of mammal biomass, far exceeding wild mammals. Human activities have halved global biomass since agriculture began, depleted fish stocks by 85-90%, destroyed 70% of forests, and caused insect declines via pesticides. It urges halting habitat destruction to preserve biodiversity.
