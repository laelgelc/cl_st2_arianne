The blog post from Greenpeace Korea explains the difference between queen and worker bees, attributing it to prolonged royal jelly consumption, leading to queens living longer, growing larger, and laying millions of eggs. It traces Korean beekeeping history from the Three Kingdoms period, its spread, and cultural symbolism of bees as diligence. It highlights a 16% decline in Korea's honeybee population by early 2022 due to climate crisis, parasites, pesticides, and plant loss, urging a government committee. The post shares facts: bees evolved from carnivores 100 million years ago, have five eyes, communicate via dances for decisions, assign worker duties by age, vary lifespans by season, feed on nectar and pollen from honey plants, and require extensive foraging to produce honey.
