Clara Natanine describes life in isolated Kangiqtugaapik (Clyde River), a Canadian Arctic town of about 1,000 people, where residents rely on hunting marine animals like narwhals, bowheads, and seals for essential food amid high store prices. The community faces a threat from energy companies planning seismic blasting in local waters, endangering wildlife and Inuit cultural traditions tied to the land and sea for thousands of years. Despite historical oppression, the resilient people are rallying to protect their rights and sustainable ways, urging support to stop the blasting.
