The blog post describes the aftermath of a mining dam collapse in Brumadinho, Brazil, causing a catastrophic mudslide with 60 confirmed deaths and over 290 missing. It recounts personal stories of grief, evacuations, and ongoing fears from a potential second dam failure. The disaster, linked to mining greed, echoes past incidents and threatens environmental damage, including sludge spreading up to 220 km, dead fish, and impacts on the Paraopeba River and Indigenous lands. Greenpeace activists are documenting the tragedy, amplifying victims' voices, and demanding justice, investigations, and reparations.
