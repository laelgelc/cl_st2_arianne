The author recalls her childhood in the Philippines, reusing glass Coca-Cola bottles and refilling canisters at local stores, fostering community pride. She contrasts this with current plastic pollution from single-use packaging by brands like Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, Nestlé, and Unilever, which contributes to climate change as plastic derives from fossil fuels. Blaming corporate overproduction, not individuals, she notes the global plastics treaty and Coca-Cola's 25% reusable packaging goal by 2030, but demands stronger commitments: 50% for Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, and Nestlé. People must reject greenwashing for a plastic-free future.
