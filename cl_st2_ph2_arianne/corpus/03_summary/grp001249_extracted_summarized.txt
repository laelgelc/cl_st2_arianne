The blog post discusses how Repsol's departure from the Chukchi Sea leaves Shell as the sole leaseholder in US Arctic waters, explaining why an Arctic oil boom never materialized due to strict regulations, low oil prices, high costs, and ice coverage. It highlights inevitable oil spills that are impossible to clean up in extreme conditions, opposition from local communities, and the broader dangers to climate change.
