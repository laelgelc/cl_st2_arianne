Waya Maweru, a student, barista, and Greenpeace Indonesia activist from Manado, shares childhood memories of Christmas visits to her grandmother in beautiful North Sulawesi, including a trip to Lembeh Island with views of Bitung and Mount Klabat. She laments Bitung's transformation into a site of forest destruction and her favorite brands' role in endangering habitats of the Cenderawasih bird, orangutans, and Sumatran tigers. Inspired on Kuta Beach in Bali, she commits to direct action, joining global activists on a rubber boat to demand Wilmar #DropDirtyPalmOil immediately for greener forests and free wildlife. She invites participation.
