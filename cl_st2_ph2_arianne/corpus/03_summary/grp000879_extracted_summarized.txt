Norway, renowned for its natural beauty and environmental respect—boasting 97% plastic bottle recycling and leading electric car adoption—is paradoxically the 7th largest exporter of climate-damaging emissions through oil production. Despite the Paris Agreement, the government and Equinor continue drilling, ignoring science that warns against burning more oil amid escalating extreme weather like Hurricane Dorian and wildfires in Siberia, the Amazon, and Indonesia. Greenpeace Nordic and Nature and Youth are appealing a lawsuit claiming this violates Norway's Constitution Article 112, which guarantees a healthy environment. The post urges supporters to add statements to strengthen the case against such fossil fuel projects.
