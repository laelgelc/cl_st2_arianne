Vanessa Nakate, a Fridays for Future leader in Kampala, Uganda, highlights how climate disasters disproportionately harm women in African communities. Floods destroy crops, forcing women to restart food production and walk long distances for survival. Droughts dry up water sources, burdening women with carrying heavy loads, causing back pain. Women, responsible for children, face homelessness, trauma, and increased risks of physical and sexual violence. Subsistence farming losses lead to forced early marriages for daughters. Pregnant women endure heightened dangers, often losing lives or dreams. Women's frontline role in climate action deserves respect, as advocating against climate change speaks for millions.
