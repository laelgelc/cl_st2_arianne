Mike Fincken, a judge in the #SaveTheArctic poster competition and captain of Greenpeace's Arctic Sunrise, selected winners Anastasia (21, Russia), Sara (18, Spain), and Emile (20, Canada), who will join him on a voyage to the Arctic. He reviewed over 2000 entries from 75 countries, tweeting favorites like "Bear Walks into a Bar," giraffes above rising seas, a fist throttling a polar bear, and Life of Pi with Arctic animals. The posters embodied "artivism," fighting injustice through art, and he urges using social media to amplify efforts to #SaveTheArctic.
