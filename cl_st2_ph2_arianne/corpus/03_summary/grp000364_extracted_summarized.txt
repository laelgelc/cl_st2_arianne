Over 100 climate activists from 17 countries, representing groups like Greenpeace and Extinction Rebellion, remain detained in Geneva 20 hours after peacefully protesting Europe's largest private jet fair, EBACE. They occupied exhibited jets, chained themselves to gangways, and displayed banners warning that private jets "Burn Our Future," "Kill Our Planet," and "Fuel Inequality," while broadcasting announcements on their environmental and social harms. Private jets symbolize injustice, emitting far more CO2 than trains, with sales booming amid climate crises disproportionately affecting non-flyers. Activists demand a ban on private jets and their immediate release; supporters are urged to sign a petition.
