The blog post recounts the origins of Greenpeace, marking its 50th anniversary in September 2021 from the first campaign against a U.S. nuclear bomb test in Amchitka, Alaska. It details the 1960s Vancouver context, where peace activists, ecologists, and draft resisters like Irving and Dorothy Stowe, Bob Hunter, Ben and Dorothy Metcalfe, Jim and Marie Bohlen, and Bill Darnell converged amid anti-war, civil rights, and environmental movements. They formed the Don’t Make a Wave Committee, inspired by Quaker protests, to sail a boat to confront the test, adopting the name "Greenpeace" to merge peace and ecology ideals.
