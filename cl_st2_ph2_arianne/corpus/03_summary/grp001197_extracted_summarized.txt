The blog post emphasizes that oceans, the origin of all life on Earth, have absorbed 90% of excess heat from greenhouse gas emissions over the past 60 years, preventing a catastrophic 36°C global warming. They provide oxygen, food, and climate regulation but are strained by industrial fishing and pollution. To ensure healthier oceans and a thriving planet, we must create ocean sanctuaries and cut emissions urgently. The author, at UN talks, advocates for a global treaty to protect biodiversity in the high seas, enabling a network of sanctuaries to rebuild marine populations and resilience. Readers are urged to share ocean photos on #HighSeas for support.
