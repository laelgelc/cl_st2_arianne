Greenpeace launched a petition urging Samsung to reuse or recycle materials from 4.3 million recalled Galaxy Note7 phones. The story gained global media attention, with over 25,000 signatures. Samsung acknowledged concerns and is reviewing options to minimize environmental impact, but has not shared public plans. The post calls for increased pressure by phoning Samsung to ask about plans for the phones, recycling or reusing components, and announcement timelines if none exist. Share responses via #SaveTheGalaxy on social media to encourage rethinking of phone design, production, and material reuse.
