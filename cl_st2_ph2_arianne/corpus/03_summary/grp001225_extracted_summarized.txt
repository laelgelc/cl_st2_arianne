The blog post celebrates the creation of the world's largest marine protected area in Antarctica's Ross Sea, covering 1,550,000 km² with most fully protected for 35 years, following years of Greenpeace campaigns at CCAMLR. It highlights this as a victory for wildlife and supporters, amid other recent protections like expansions in Papahanaumokuakea and new monuments. The post stresses the need for high seas sanctuaries via UN action, aiming for 40% ocean protection by 2030 to boost biodiversity and resilience, urging continued public mobilization against fishing interests.
