The blog post warns that deep sea mining threatens the ocean's unexplored ecosystems, unique species, and blue carbon storage, potentially worsening climate change by releasing stored carbon and disrupting marine processes. It highlights risks like irreversible damage to habitats, sediment plumes, pollution, noise, and light disturbances harming wildlife, including potential extinctions. Companies downplay these dangers while pushing mining as a "green solution," but alternatives like recycling are urged. Greenpeace calls for a Global Ocean Treaty to protect international waters and build a movement for healthy oceans.
