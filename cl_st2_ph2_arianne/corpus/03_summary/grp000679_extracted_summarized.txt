On International Workers’ Day, the blog celebrates workers' historical achievements like weekends off and sick pay, highlighting their resilience and collective power. It emphasizes Greenpeace's support for a just transition from polluting industries like fossil fuels and aviation to sustainable ones, ensuring fair treatment through social safety nets, re-training, employment guarantees, and union involvement. Polluters, especially fossil fuel companies, should fund this shift, as their denial tactics harm workers. The post calls for tailored policies, investments in green jobs, and collective action to achieve environmental and social justice.
