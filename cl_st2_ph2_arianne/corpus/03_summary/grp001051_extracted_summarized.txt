The International Whaling Commission (IWC) meeting in Brazil brings together government delegates and NGOs every two years. Key issues include a polarized debate on whaling, with pro-whaling nations seeking to undermine the commercial whaling ban, amid recent controversy over Iceland's killing of hybrid blue whales. Competing visions for the IWC's future are Japan's 'Way Forward' proposal to legitimize commercial whaling and Brazil's 'Florianopolis Declaration' to focus on conservation and whales' role in oceans. A proposed South Atlantic Whale Sanctuary faces political resistance. Greenpeace experts are defending the ban, supporting the sanctuary, and advocating for a conservation-oriented IWC.
