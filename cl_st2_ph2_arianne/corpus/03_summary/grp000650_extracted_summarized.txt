The blog post reflects on Greenpeace's 50th anniversary through virtual mailbag calls, sharing stories like the 1981 "test blockade" of an oil tanker that prevented an oil port's construction. It advocates creative activism, such as boycotting ineffective climate conferences and painting future sea-level rise on buildings. It links pandemics to ecological overshoot from human growth and consumption, urging the environmental movement to address population, capitalism, and contraction. The author finds hope in reconnecting with nature, discusses Greenpeace's evolution, personal experiences, and the importance of creativity in enduring movements.
