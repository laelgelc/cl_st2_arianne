Akiko Tsuchiya, a Greenpeace Japan Communications Officer, visited Amami Oshima after the Sanchi tanker's oil spill reached its shores from the East China Sea. She observed oil lumps on beaches, an oil-soaked fishing net, and wildlife impacts, including a dead streaked shearwater and a choking sea turtle. Clean-up operations collected waste, but toxicity lingers in sand and marine life. Oil spills are inevitable with fossil fuel dependence; she urges reducing petrochemicals like single-use plastics, walking or biking more, and supporting renewables to combat ocean threats like overfishing and pollution.
