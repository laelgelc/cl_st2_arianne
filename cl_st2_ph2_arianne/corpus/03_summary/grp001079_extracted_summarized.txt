Dr. Nate Hagens teaches "Reality 101" at the University of Minnesota, exploring humanity's predicaments like economic decline, inequality, pollution, biodiversity loss, and war through systems ecology, neuroscience, and economics. The text addresses "What can I do?" by advocating non-linear approaches, emphasizing principles like building community cohesion, preserving ecosystems, promoting local energy and food systems, accepting complexity, loving nature, and self-improvement ("sharpen the sword"). It prioritizes reducing consumption, stabilizing population, cutting energy demand, and ending militarism, with actions including campaigns, local initiatives, education, and resource sharing, plus book recommendations for deeper learning.
