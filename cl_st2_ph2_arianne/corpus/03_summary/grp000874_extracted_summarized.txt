In October 2017, eight Greenpeace France activists infiltrated the Cattenom nuclear plant, reaching the spent fuel pool and setting off fireworks to expose security vulnerabilities in France's aging reactors, which could lead to massive radioactivity release if attacked. This non-violent direct action alarmed Luxembourg and prompted a French parliamentary investigation. However, the "Cattenom nine" received sentences including jail time, suspended terms, and €50,000 in damages to EDF. Comparisons highlight harsher penalties than in similar cases in Russia, the UK, and Australia. An appeal on 30 October will argue justification by "state of necessity."
