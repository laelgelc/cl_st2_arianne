Greenpeace activists climbed the 14-storey EU Commission headquarters in Brussels to protest Europe's complicity in global forest destruction, unfurling a banner and spreading ashes symbolizing Amazon fires and indigenous struggles. The EU imports 36% of globally traded deforestation-linked products like beef, palm oil, and soy, accounting for over 10% of worldwide forest loss. Companies failed their 2010 promise to eliminate deforestation from supply chains by 2020. The post calls for a strong EU law banning such products and urges participation in the Commission's public consultation to demand action against deforestation and human rights abuses.
