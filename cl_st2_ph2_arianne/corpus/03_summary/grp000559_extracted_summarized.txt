The blog post argues that plastic waste dumping from Western countries to African and other global majority nations constitutes "waste colonialism," perpetuating exploitation similar to historical colonialism by impoverishing communities, creating health issues, and distracting from sustainable solutions. It cites a UN report on disproportionate impacts on marginalized people of color, references ongoing colonial-like practices like France's "colonial tax" and illegal fishing, and details post-China ban waste shifts to places like Senegal and Kenya. It calls for a strong global plastic treaty with binding rules, reduced single-use plastics, and accountable waste management to end this injustice.
