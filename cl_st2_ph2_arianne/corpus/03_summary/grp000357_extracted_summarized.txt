In South Africa, Common Power's Community Energy Accelerator (CEA) trains young professionals in solar project design to combat the energy crisis marked by load shedding since 2007, caused by mismanagement, sabotage, and corruption at Eskom. Participants like Abongile Gogo, Chitola Mufali, Avuziwe Mfeka, Lucy Mofokeng, and Luvuyo Mdepha highlight benefits including democratized energy access, community empowerment, job creation, affordable green solutions, and independence from outages. The program offers skills in business, digital tools, finance, and engagement, with a pilot collaboration with Greenpeace Africa to mentor developers for community solar and battery projects.
