The Arctic, home to threatened wildlife like polar bears and narwhals, plays a key role in global climate but is warming twice as fast due to Arctic amplification. Melting sea ice reduces albedo, creating a positive feedback loop that alters atmospheric circulations, jet streams, and weather patterns, leading to more extreme events like super-storms, droughts, and floods. These changes cause human and economic losses. Lacking international protection, the Arctic needs ecosystem-based protected areas, as urged by Greenpeace, which calls for public support to create an Arctic Sanctuary.
