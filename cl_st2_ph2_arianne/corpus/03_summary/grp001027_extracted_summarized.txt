European tuna giant Bolton has adopted a progressive sourcing policy after eight years of public pressure, moving from a 2011 laggard to committing that 50% of its tuna (up 22%) comes from selective methods like pole and line or FAD-free purse seining. It will cap FADs at 300, prohibit supply vessels, and reduce bycatch. This follows Thai Union's landmark commitments last year amid Greenpeace campaigns addressing overfishing, bycatch, and labor abuses. The changes signal industry momentum for ocean and worker protection, urging other companies to improve, while highlighting individual actions' impact. Greenpeace calls for an Antarctic ocean sanctuary.
