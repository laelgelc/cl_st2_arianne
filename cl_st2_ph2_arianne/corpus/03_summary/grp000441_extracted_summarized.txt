Alessandro Saccoccio, a Greenpeace campaigner, shares a nightmare about his son wanting a Black Friday video game console, contrasting it with his desire for nature-based memories. He blames consumerism, fueled by ads and brands, for pressuring overconsumption in cities, which generate nearly three-quarters of global emissions and require 1.8 Earths to sustain. The richest 10% cause 36-45% of emissions and threaten nature and food supplies. Solutions include carbon taxes on the super-rich, phasing out fossil fuels, and promoting low-carbon lifestyles through reuse, sharing, and experiences over objects. He advocates regulating ads and teaching children that happiness comes from doing, not buying.
