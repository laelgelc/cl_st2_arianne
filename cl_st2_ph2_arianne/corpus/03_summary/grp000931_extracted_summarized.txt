The blog post highlights the deep ocean's bizarre creatures and mysterious hydrothermal vents, like the Lost City, discovered in 2000, which feature towering chimneys and unique life forms thriving in extreme conditions. These vents, possibly the origin of life on Earth through chemical reactions creating hydrocarbons, remain poorly understood. However, deep-sea mining licenses threaten to destroy them before full study. Greenpeace's Pole to Pole expedition visits the Lost City to advocate for protection against exploitation, urging public support to safeguard vulnerable marine habitats.
