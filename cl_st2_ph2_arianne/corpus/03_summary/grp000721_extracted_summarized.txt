Dorothy Stowe, who would be 100 today, passed away ten years ago in Vancouver, where she co-founded Greenpeace with her husband Irving and other pacifists and ecologists. A 2009 photo captures her at a CD release party for the 1970 concert featuring Joni Mitchell and James Taylor that launched Greenpeace. She exemplified unwavering dedication, modesty, and kindness, focusing activism on issues rather than herself, volunteering for any task, and remaining unintimidated even by figures like Canada's Prime Minister. Dorothy and Irving held their wedding at NAACP headquarters, became Quakers dedicated to peace and justice, adopted the name "Stowe" from Harriet Beecher Stowe, and provided stabilizing, inclusive influence in Greenpeace's early years, inspiring others through hard work and heart.
