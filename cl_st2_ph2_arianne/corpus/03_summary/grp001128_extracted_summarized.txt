The blog post discusses historical barriers preventing women from joining Antarctic expeditions, such as rejections based on assumptions about shops, hairdressers, extreme temperatures, facilities, and scientific capabilities, with some exclusions lasting until the early 1980s. It highlights everyday sexism in this context but notes that women's determination has overcome these obstacles, enabling their active roles in Antarctic science and protection. Greenpeace's Arctic Sunrise expedition, involving female scientists, crew, campaigners, and others, aims to establish the world's largest protected area—an Antarctic Ocean Sanctuary—by year's end, celebrated with a video for International Women’s Day.
