Greenpeace investigated APP and the Sinar Mas Group, uncovering nearly 8,000 hectares of forest and peatland cleared in linked concessions since 2013, including 3,000 hectares in PT Muara Sungai Landak. Despite APP's 2013 Forest Conservation Policy, restoration commitments, and progress like conserving over 500,000 hectares via High Carbon Stock Approach and peatland mapping, the company failed to address group-level deforestation and transparency issues. Consequently, Greenpeace ended its engagement, criticizing APP's untrustworthiness, and will urge customers and investors to demand reforms or withdraw support.
