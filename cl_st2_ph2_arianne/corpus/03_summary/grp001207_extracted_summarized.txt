Greenpeace's Detox Outdoor campaign, launched in late 2015, aimed to eliminate hazardous PFCs from weatherproofing in outdoor gear, with support from the outdoor community and supporters. Gore Fabrics, supplier of GORE-TEX® to brands like The North Face and Mammut, has committed to removing hazardous PFCs from general laminates by 2020 and specialized ones by 2023. This victory stems from hundreds of thousands of actions, including online petitions, product testing votes, and over 150 global activities pressuring brands. Early leaders like Paramo, Rotauf, and Vaude signed PFC-free commitments, with brands urging Gore to act.
