Indigenous leaders and supporters are resisting Kinder Morgan's tar sands pipeline in Canada by building a "Watch House" near the route and protesting, with over 10,000 marching and 170 arrested. The pipeline, lacking Indigenous consent, would transport polluting bitumen, increase supertanker traffic threatening endangered orcas, and risk spills contaminating water. Protesters draw parallels to Standing Rock, where violence occurred and ETP filed a $900 million SLAPP suit against Greenpeace and others to suppress dissent, but it has strengthened the movement. Greenpeace reaffirms its commitment to protecting the coast.
