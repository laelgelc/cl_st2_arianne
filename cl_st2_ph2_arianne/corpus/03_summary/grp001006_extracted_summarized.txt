The blog post critiques ongoing climate inaction amid rising CO2 levels and record emissions, highlighting how unconventional fossil fuels—like tar sands bitumen, heavy oils, synthetic liquids, deepwater oil, biofuels, and fracked tight oil—mask the peak of conventional oil production. These sources are described as low-quality, energy-intensive, environmentally destructive, causing spills, pollution, health risks, and high carbon emissions, while relying on debt and Ponzi-like schemes. The post argues this delays the transition to renewables, exacerbating climate change.
