The Spanish Congress approved the Climate Change and Energy Transition Law, but it lacks ambition to address the climate emergency. It includes measures on public procurement for lower emissions, diet's role in sustainability, climate finance reporting, and a minimum budget percentage for climate action. However, it falls short on taxation reform, ambitious emissions targets (only 23% reduction by 2030), fossil fuel phase-out, and bans on ads or short-haul flights. Greenpeace critiques it as watered-down, highlighting pros like low emission zones and energy renovation, but urges stronger commitments for a fair ecological transition.
