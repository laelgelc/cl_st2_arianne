The blog post discusses the increasing prevalence of underground peat fires, dubbed "zombie fires," in northern Russia, which persist even under snow and pose risks for the 2022 fire season. It highlights the 2021 record of 18.8 million hectares burned, with smoke reaching the North Pole, and ongoing smouldering in the Urals causing smoke in Yekaterinburg. These fires are described as a "climate bomb" due to high greenhouse gas emissions from burning ancient organic matter. Greenpeace Russia, with expertise in combating them, has offered and been accepted to assist the regional government in prevention and extinguishing efforts.
