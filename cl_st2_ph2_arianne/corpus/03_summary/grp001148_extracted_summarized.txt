Jennifer Morgan discusses shocking ocean plastic pollution and Taiwan's efforts to combat it, including a 2002 ban on free plastic bags in mainstream shops, though small businesses still use them. She highlights local innovations for plastic-free living and urges government policy to phase out single-use plastics by 2025. The post also addresses Taiwan's rising carbon emissions, driven by coal power, conflicting with its 50% reduction pledge by 2030. Taiwan aims for 20% renewables, 30% coal, and 50% gas by 2025, phasing out nuclear, but must accelerate to 100% renewables for a just transition.
