The blog post argues that Africa's environmental movement cannot succeed without decolonization, as colonial-era extraction of raw materials persists, benefiting foreign elites while harming ecosystems, economies, and communities. It calls for African leaders to reject Western models, embrace traditional values of collaboration and nature respect, and build inward-focused economies prioritizing collective well-being, local innovation, and informal activities. Examples include Shell's pollution in Nigeria, DRC deforestation amid poverty, and ongoing multinational projects like oil drilling in Namibia, pipelines in East Africa, and auctions in DRC, exacerbating climate crises despite floods, droughts, and rising food prices.
