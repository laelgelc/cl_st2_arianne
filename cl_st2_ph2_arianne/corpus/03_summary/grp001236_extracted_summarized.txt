Greenpeace surveyed smartphone habits in six countries: USA, Germany, Russia, Mexico, South Korea, and China. Findings show higher repair rates in China (66%) and Korea (64%) than in the US (28%) and Germany (23%). Hazardous chemicals like benzene and n-hexane are used in manufacturing, posing health risks. Four in five respondents prioritize phones without such chemicals, easy repair (up to 95% in China), and recycling. Over half believe manufacturers release too many models and should handle recycling. Smartphones generate nearly three million tonnes of e-waste annually, straining the environment. Greenpeace calls for sustainable gadgets and invites involvement.
