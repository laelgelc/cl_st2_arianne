Greenpeace highlights that global brand audits identify Coca-Cola, Nestlé, and PepsiCo as top plastic polluters for three years, as they invest in false solutions and partner with oil companies to produce more plastic. These firms must end reliance on single-use plastic packaging, shift from fossil fuels, and support regulations to reduce their plastic footprint and combat climate change. Plastic, made 99% from fossil fuels, fuels climate issues and is toxic throughout its lifecycle, with only 2% recycled circularly. Millions are demanding change through petitions, lobbying, and community actions to promote refill and reuse.
