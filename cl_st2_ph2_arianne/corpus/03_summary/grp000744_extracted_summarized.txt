The blog post discusses the escalating fires in Brazil's Amazon, the worst in a decade, exacerbated by government policies that weaken environmental enforcement and enable agribusiness and mining. It highlights threats to Indigenous Peoples from land invasions and COVID-19, with over 34,000 cases and 837 deaths. The Amazon's destruction risks biodiversity, climate stability, and regional rainfall, releasing stored carbon in a vicious cycle. Fires also ravage the Cerrado and Pantanal, driven mainly by cattle ranching (80% of Amazon deforestation) and soy production for livestock. The post urges collective action to protect these biomes and Indigenous rights.
