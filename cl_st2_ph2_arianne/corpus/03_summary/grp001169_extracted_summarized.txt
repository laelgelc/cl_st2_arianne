Greenpeace has used giant sun symbols to advocate for renewable energy since displaying one in Paris two years ago during the Climate Conference, demanding a shift from fossil fuels. Recently, suns appeared in Barcelona, Croatia, and various European countries like Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Slovenia, and Brussels. Last week, 65 activists from five countries unveiled a "Go solar!" banner outside the European Commission, urging EU leaders to support renewables and abandon dirty fuels amid reviews of energy legislation. The post calls for signatures on a petition and sharing a video to push for a clean energy future, noting ordinary people and businesses are ready to join the revolution.
