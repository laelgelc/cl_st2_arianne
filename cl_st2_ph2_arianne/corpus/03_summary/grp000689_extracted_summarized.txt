Two hundred Brazilian civil society organizations, including Greenpeace Brazil, sent a letter to the US government urging it not to support President Jair Bolsonaro's destructive environmental policies through secretive negotiations. These talks involve billions in US funds to curb Amazon deforestation, but Bolsonaro's administration has weakened climate commitments below Paris Agreement levels, increased deforestation, harmed Indigenous Peoples, and failed to use existing funds like the Amazon Fund. The letter warns that such a deal would legitimize anti-environmental actions and direct resources to large landowners, undermining US climate leadership under Biden.
