The blog post criticizes the car industry for producing increasingly heavier vehicles, like SUVs, which consume more energy and emit higher CO2, even in electric models due to larger batteries. Examples include the VW Golf's weight gain over decades, leading to 57% more emissions, and the heavier Tiguan. SUVs pose greater accident risks to pedestrians and others, with drivers more prone to risky behavior. The industry prioritizes profits over the Paris Agreement, heavily advertising and investing in SUVs amid booming sales. It calls for smaller electric cars, shared ownership, more public transport, and fewer vehicles, highlighting a Greenpeace protest against SUV imports.
