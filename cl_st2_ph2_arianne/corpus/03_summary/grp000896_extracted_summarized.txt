The blog post outlines five reasons why McDonald’s, KFC, and Burger King must oppose Amazon destruction: their pressure could force President Bolsonaro to protect the forest amid global outcry; the Amazon is vital for global climate regulation, carbon storage, water vapor production, rainfall, Indigenous Peoples, and biodiversity, preventing droughts, famines, heatwaves, and storms; they buy Brazilian beef and soya-fed chicken that fuel deliberate fires for agriculture; they promised to end deforestation but continue sourcing from destructive suppliers and driving meat demand; and other companies like H&M, Timberland, Vans, salmon producers, and investors are already taking stands against Brazilian products.
