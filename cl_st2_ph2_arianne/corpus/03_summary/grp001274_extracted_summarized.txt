The blog post explores tactics for social change, contrasting non-violent approaches of Quakers, Gandhi, and Aung San Suu Kyi with Saul Alinsky's use of ridicule and personalization. It critiques theories like evolutionary, cyclical, conflict, economic, and technological drivers, arguing social systems are complex living entities without a single formula. Drawing from books like "Getting to Maybe" and "The 8 Laws of Change," it emphasizes networks, non-attachment to outcomes, integrity, and disrupting cultural myths through actions. Greenpeace's "mind bombs" and lists of influential books and novels are highlighted.
