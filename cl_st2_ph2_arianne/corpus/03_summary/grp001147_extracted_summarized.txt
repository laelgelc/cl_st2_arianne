The blog post by Greenpeace International's Executive Directors emphasizes resisting powerful institutions destroying the planet through equal acts of courage, from protests to questioning consumerism and powerlessness. It highlights past achievements like exposing trade deals, protecting ecosystems, establishing marine sanctuaries, legal accountability, phasing out single-use plastics, and ending fossil fuels. Urging a focus on "tomorrow," it calls for breaking overconsumption, holding corporations accountable, reducing industrial livestock impacts, promoting equality, and shaking inequitable power structures. Despite disheartening news, they advocate rising through contagious courage, embracing renewables, sustainable agriculture, and empowering leaders to rebuild a positive future.
