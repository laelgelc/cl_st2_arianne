Joanna Sustento, a climate activist from Tacloban, Philippines, recounts losing most of her family in the 2013 super typhoon Haiyan, worsened by climate change. She refuses to stay silent as lives and livelihoods are sacrificed for corporate profits, finding personal strength and support in her journey. In a letter to Shell and the oil industry, she demands justice for her nephew Tarin, lost in the storm, and for thousands killed in affected communities, urging the industry to mitigate climate crisis impacts before it's too late, as even their own families' futures are at risk.
