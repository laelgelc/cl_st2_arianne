The blog post highlights recent extreme weather events in Japan, Europe, and California— including floods, heatwaves, typhoons, and wildfires—as evidence of human-induced climate change driven by CO2 emissions and jet stream shifts. It details tragic deaths, such as children in Japan and Greece, and firefighters in California, amid accelerating Antarctic ice melt and dying ancient trees. The world is off track from Paris Agreement goals, heading toward 3°C warming, but an upcoming IPCC report stresses limiting to 1.5°C through shifts from fossil fuels and protections for oceans, forests, and farming. It urges immediate action from leaders for climate justice.
