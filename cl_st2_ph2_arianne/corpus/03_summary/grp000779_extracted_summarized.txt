One year after the shocking Amazon fires, destruction continues unabated, with 2020 potentially more devastating for the rainforest and Indigenous Peoples. Greenpeace Brazil's aerial images from Mato Grosso reveal ongoing fires despite a government ban, highlighting its ineffectiveness. Over a million hectares burned last year, and June saw record fire hotspots. President Bolsonaro's policies dismantle environmental protections, enabling unchecked deforestation for pastures. This exacerbates the climate crisis, biodiversity loss, and threats to Indigenous lives, worsened by COVID-19's high mortality rates and smoke-related respiratory risks. Pressure from investors and the public demands stronger laws, funding for agencies, Indigenous rights protection, and an end to business with forest destroyers.
