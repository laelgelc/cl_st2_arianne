The blog post describes the author's experience as a volunteer deckhand on the Greenpeace ship Arctic Sunrise, sailing in the Sylt Outer Reef marine sanctuary off Germany's coast. It explains nautical terms like bulkheads for walls, deckheads for ceilings, and the constant wobbling at sea affecting daily life in areas such as the mess (dining room) and galley (kitchen). Campaigner Thilo Maack notes that while dumping and drilling are banned to curb ocean exploitation, industrial bottom trawling continues, gouging the seabed and catching brown shrimp along with up to 80% bycatch, including endangered harbor porpoises, discarded dead—amid risks to a third of species in this "sanctuary."
