Sri Lanka is enduring a severe environmental disaster as tons of plastic pellets, microplastics used for single-use packaging, have washed ashore near the capital, devastating beaches and threatening marine life. Authorities warn against touching them due to potential toxicity. The incident stems from the X-Press Pearl ship catching fire on May 20 from a nitric acid leak, leading to containers of pellets falling overboard. Shipping companies should be held accountable, and plastic classified as hazardous with IMDG codes. The crisis highlights a broken system where fossil fuel and consumer brands prioritize profits, fueling plastic pollution, climate change, health issues, and social injustice. Brands like Coca-Cola, Nestlé, and Pepsi must abandon single-use plastics for global reuse systems.
