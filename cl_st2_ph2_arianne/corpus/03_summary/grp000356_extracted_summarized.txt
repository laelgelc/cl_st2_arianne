On World Environment Day, the author expresses pride in Greenpeace's global community of volunteers, supporters, activists, and campaigners who work tirelessly to protect the environment daily. Their passion inspires perseverance amid visible climate change impacts, such as extreme weather events. Leaders are ignoring these warnings, exemplified by Shanghai's hottest May day in 100 years and Italy's severe flooding causing widespread damage and over a dozen deaths. Such events should not become the new normal, and accompanying images highlight global difficulties, urging unity in the fight against climate change.
