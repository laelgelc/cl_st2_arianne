Indigenous Peoples in Brazil demand an end to Amazon destruction and violence against forest guardians. At the 18th Free Land Camp in Brasilia, over 5,000 leaders from 120 groups gather for 10 days of non-violent protests under the theme "Retaking Brazil: Demarcating Territories and Indigenize the Politics," calling for immediate land demarcation and addressing issues like health and education. They denounce threats including deforestation, mining expansion via bills like PL 191/2020, and the #PacotedaDestruição. A petition with 517,000 signatures, symbolized by a totem pole with ribbons, was delivered to the Ministry of Justice amid rising murders and invasions, as per CIMI data.
