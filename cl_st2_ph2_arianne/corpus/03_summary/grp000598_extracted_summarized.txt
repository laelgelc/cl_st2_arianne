Greenpeace USA urges Senators to end fossil fuel subsidies and back climate provisions in the Build Back Better Act, while over 75,000 people petition for an EU ban on fossil fuel ads and sponsorships. At COP26 in Glasgow, leaders must signal the end of the fossil fuel era, with oil giants like BP and Shell facing limited access due to emissions plan requirements. In a U.S. Congressional hearing, executives from ExxonMobil, BP, Chevron, Shell, and lobbying groups refused to halt opposition to emissions reductions, engaging in greenwashing and disinformation. The committee chair announced subpoenas for related documents.
