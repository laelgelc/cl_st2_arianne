Thai mackerel, once abundant and affordable, is now scarce due to unregulated overfishing of juveniles, with 2020 catches ten times lower than in 2014. Fish are smaller, often imported, and more expensive, threatening food security for the poor. Local fishers from 23 provinces campaigned against catching juveniles, establishing nurseries and urging supermarkets to stop sales. They organized the "Reclaim Mackerel Chili Paste" voyage, sailing over 1,000 km from Pattani to Bangkok's parliament on World Oceans Day to demand enforcement of Section 57 of the Fisheries Act. Media coverage raised awareness, prompting a government promise, but no action has followed, leading to a 60-day ultimatum.
