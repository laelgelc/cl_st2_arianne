Today marks International Whale Shark Day, celebrating these gentle giants that resemble a mix of whale and shark but pose no threat to humans. Found in tropical oceans like the Maldives, Philippines, and Mexico, they are the largest non-mammalian vertebrates, feeding mainly on plankton. Despite their docile nature, they are hunted for fins and meat, making them vulnerable to overfishing due to slow breeding. Each has unique patterns like fingerprints for tracking. The IUCN lists them as highly vulnerable, and while Indonesia has conservation laws, enforcement is weak. Raise a glass to protect them and their ocean home.
