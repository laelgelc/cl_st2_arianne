Greenpeace organizations in neighboring countries like Slovakia and Romania are supporting Ukrainian refugees with supplies, tents, food, and aid amid the fastest-growing refugee crisis since World War II. The blog links the war to fossil fuel dependence, urging a transition to renewables for peace and sustainability. Activists have protested Russian oil and gas imports through non-violent actions in Germany, Spain, France, and elsewhere. Global peaceful protests oppose the invasion, echoing Greenpeace's 50-year history of fusing peace and ecology against war and militarism.
