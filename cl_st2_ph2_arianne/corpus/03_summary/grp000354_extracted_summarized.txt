Roger Payne (1935-2023) recorded "Songs of the Humpback Whale" in 1970, selling over 100,000 copies and inspiring the global anti-whaling movement, including Greenpeace. His work founded Ocean Alliance and helped secure the 1982 commercial whaling moratorium. Greenpeace activist Rémi Parmentier used the album in campaigns, arranging its French release in 1978 to promote the Rainbow Warrior's anti-whaling missions. Kelly Rigg recalls Payne's supportive testimony against offshore oil drilling in 1982, highlighting his respect for young campaigners. Payne's empathetic listening to whales and humans deepened humanity's connection to nature.
