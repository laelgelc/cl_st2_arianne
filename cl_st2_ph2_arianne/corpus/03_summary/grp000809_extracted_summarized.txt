In September 2019, over seven million people in 180 countries, led by youth through groups like Fridays For Future, protested for climate action, marking the largest global climate demonstration in history. Examples included tag-teaming in Moscow, protected marches in Kabul, plastic outfits in Nairobi, and events across Latin America. Diverse groups—unions, NGOs, grandparents, teachers, and parents—joined with creative elements like color, banners, music, and dance. Amid COVID-19, the movement shifts to digital strikes on April 24, 2020, demanding green legislation like the Green New Deal, amplified via social media and technology for global connection and debate.
