Madjuri, a lifelong fisherman in Karimun Jawa, Indonesia, describes how his home, a national marine park rich with turtles, sharks, and fish, has been harmed by coal barges. Previously, locals caught abundant fish nearby, but now barges pollute the ocean with black runoff and smoky fumes causing coughing and vomiting. They destroy reefs, traps, and bait by anchoring, scaring away fish, and their bright lights steal cuttlefish from local fishers. Despite complaints to authorities, nothing changes, threatening families' livelihoods and the area's pristine nature for future generations. He urges standing against these destructive barges.
