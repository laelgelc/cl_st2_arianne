The blog post celebrates World Photography Day on August 19, quoting Robert Capa's advice on getting close for better photos. Written by Sudhanshu Malhotra, Greenpeace International's Multimedia Editor in Hong Kong, it explores photography's profound, personal yet public nature and its 19th-century origins in bearing witness through landscapes and portraits. Over 200 years, images have served as court evidence and inspired action. As an ally to environmental movements, photography communicates universally. The post features 12 iconic Greenpeace images, including a plastic-entangled turtle, bloodied whale prompting whaling bans, oil-soaked pelicans, deforested Indonesia, Standing Rock protesters, and a victorious woman against a coal company, urging readers to join the movement.
