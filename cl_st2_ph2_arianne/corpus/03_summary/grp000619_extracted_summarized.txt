The blog post argues that to avoid climate disaster and meet the Paris Agreement's 1.5°C goal, society must transform food systems, as farming contributes one-quarter of global GHGs, with livestock accounting for 14.5% and half of methane emissions. It criticizes the UN Food Systems Summit (UNFSS) for corporate dominance, sidelining smallholder farmers and Indigenous Peoples, and favoring industry fixes like GM chickens over reducing meat and dairy by 50% by 2050, as per Greenpeace's report. It urges amplifying local voices, embracing ecological systems, and resisting livestock lobby expansion to prevent deforestation, health crises, and inequity.
