The deep ocean harbors ancient coral reefs, underwater mountains, and long-lived sea creatures, offering clues to life's origins. A new industry seeks to mine the seabed for corporate profit, but scientists warn this could cause irreversible damage to marine life and carbon-storing processes, exacerbating the climate crisis. Amid negotiations for a Global Ocean Treaty, the industry lobbies governments, with an area the size of France and Germany already opened for exploration. Greenpeace investigations reveal a web of Global North-based companies exposing Global South sponsoring states to risks, undermining corporate claims. Activists reject this, urging protection over exploitation; watch Ocean Witness and support the treaty.
