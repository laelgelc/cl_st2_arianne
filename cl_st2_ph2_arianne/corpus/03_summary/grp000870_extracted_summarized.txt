Kate Nelson shares her 11-year journey to living plastic-free after witnessing ocean plastic pollution in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. She eliminated single-use items like straws, bags, bottles, and cups by using reusables such as cloth bags, glass jars, and refillable vessels. This lifestyle fostered creativity, healthier eating, and community connections. She promotes Global Refill Day on November 6, urging people to bring reusables to stores, request fillings, and share photos with #ReuseRevolution and #BreakFreeFromPlastic to normalize reuse, inspire others, and push companies toward refillable solutions for systemic change.
