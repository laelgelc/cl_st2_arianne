The blog post links human-induced climate change and the Ukraine war to fossil fuel dependency, as stated by Ukrainian scientist Svitlana Krakovska. It criticizes fossil fuel companies for profiting from conflicts and crises, urging governments to phase out fossil fuels immediately for peace and climate security. Fossil fuels comprise over 80% of global energy, fueling geopolitical imbalances and wars, including Russia's invasion. It advocates reducing energy demand through efficiency and transitioning to renewables, which are faster to install, cheaper, and less prone to power struggles. The post calls for divesting from Russian fossil fuels, embargoing them, and providing humanitarian aid, noting historical oil-related conflicts and companies exploiting the crisis.
