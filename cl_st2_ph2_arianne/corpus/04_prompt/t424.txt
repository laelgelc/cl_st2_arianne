Siberia has emerged as a climate crisis hotspot with mega fires ravaging Taiga forests, blanketing Russian cities in haze. Authorities have inadequately resourced firefighting, endangering communities and exacerbating climate change. Since 2020, 19 million hectares—larger than Greece—have burned, mainly in Far Eastern Russia and Eastern Siberia, with smoke worsening air quality and respiratory issues amid COVID-19. Greenpeace Russia documented fires in Krasnoyarsk and deployed volunteers to combat rare blazes in the Denezhkin Kamen reserve near the Urals, triggered by drought, heatwaves, and lightning. This is a climate emergency; authorities must halt forest protection cutbacks to safeguard people and the planet.
