In 1971, a group of activists, funded by a rock concert featuring Joni Mitchell and James Taylor, sailed the boat "Greenpeace" to Amchitka Island to protest a US nuclear test. The voyage faced internal conflicts, ego clashes, and interception by the US Navy, failing to reach the site. Despite this, it sparked massive media attention, leading to the cancellation of further tests and Amchitka's designation as a bird sanctuary. Bob Hunter recounts his initial despair over the "failure," but recognizes it as the successful start of Greenpeace, now a global organization with millions of members.
