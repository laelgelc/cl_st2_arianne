Policy-makers are gathering in Nairobi for UNEA 5.2 to address the plastic pollution crisis, offering a chance for substantial decisions. Fishers report declining fish stocks, plastic in nets and fish, threatening food security, and urge enforcement of existing laws. Despite Kenya's plastic bans, pollution persists amid pressure to relax restrictions. The post calls for a strong global plastics treaty covering the full life cycle, including legally binding measures, keeping oil and gas in the ground, promoting refill and reuse, waste management, and just transitions. Examples highlight severe impacts in South African townships like Lenasia, where plastic exacerbates flooding and living conditions, and in remote Congolese areas affecting fishers.
