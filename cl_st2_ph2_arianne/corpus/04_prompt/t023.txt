Mr. Mindbomb is a biography of Greenpeace co-founder Robert Lorne Hunter (1941-2005), edited by his wife Bobbi Hunter, featuring accounts from friends, family, and colleagues. It details his early life, journalism career, pacifist influences, and pivotal role in Greenpeace's formation, including campaigns against nuclear testing and whaling using "mindbomb" tactics. Contributors recount his humility, humor, and inspiration in global ecology actions, his post-Greenpeace work as an ecology reporter, and his enduring legacy through books like 2030: Thermageddon. Family reflections highlight his passing and spirit of positive change.
