Sophie Marjanac, an environmental lawyer with Client Earth, discusses her background in the Blue Mountains and shift to environmental law via university activism and land rights work with Indigenous Australians. She emphasizes the intrinsic link between environmental protection and human rights, highlighting a wave of climate lawsuits against governments and fossil fuel companies, inspired by cases like Urgenda in the Netherlands. Despite setbacks, she advocates persistence, notes the groundbreaking Philippines investigation into carbon majors' human rights impacts, advises seeking support from defender networks, and draws hope from passionate youth demanding climate action.
