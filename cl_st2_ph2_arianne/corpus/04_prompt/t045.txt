On International Women’s Day, fossil fuel companies use PR to promote gender diversity, but they drive the climate crisis, exacerbating inequalities and violence against women and gender minorities. These groups face higher risks in disasters, limited relief, and increased sexual and physical violence, especially in "man camps" near extraction sites, as seen in North Dakota's Bakken oil boom. The patriarchal industry has low female employment, large gender pay gaps, and fuels inequality. A shift to renewables is urged to end this, banning new projects and phasing out fossil fuels for climate justice.
