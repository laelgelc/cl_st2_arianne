Israel's Energy Minister Yuval Steinitz announced the country will eliminate coal and oil use by 2030, promoting electric vehicles, gas-powered trucks, and electricity from gas and renewables. Greenpeace Israel campaigned against coal plants in Hadera and Ashkelon, highlighting their health, financial, and climate harms, including greenhouse gas emissions and premature deaths. Instead of installing scrubbers, they pushed for shutdowns, securing commitments to close old units by 2022 and end coal imports. The group advocates for 100% renewables, emphasizing solar to meet Paris Agreement goals and protect future generations.
