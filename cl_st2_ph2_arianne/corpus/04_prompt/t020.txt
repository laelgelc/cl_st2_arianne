The blog post discusses how corporations use SLAPPs (Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation) to intimidate and silence environmental defenders through meritless lawsuits that drain time and resources. It cites reports documenting 355 global SLAPP cases since 2015, mostly in the Global South, with the fossil fuel industry targeting over 150 entities. Anti-SLAPP efforts include a proposed US federal bill and EU directive. Greenpeace shares its anti-SLAPP toolkit, emphasizing raising awareness, funds, and voices, and celebrates a recent court dismissal of a $100 million lawsuit against it. SLAPPs threaten free speech and public participation.
