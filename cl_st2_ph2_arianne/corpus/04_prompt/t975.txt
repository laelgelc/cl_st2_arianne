The blog post highlights global support for the Arctic 30—Greenpeace activists, journalists, and crew arrested by Russia during a peaceful protest against Gazprom's Arctic oil platform. Families have launched petitions, websites, and pickets; supporters include Nobel laureates, leaders like Angela Merkel and Hillary Clinton, and organizations sending 1.5 million emails and gathering a million signatures. The Netherlands seeks their release via the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea.
