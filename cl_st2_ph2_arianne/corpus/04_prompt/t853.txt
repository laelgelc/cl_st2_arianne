Greenpeace has launched a campaign to protect the Amazon Reef, a unique 9,500-square-kilometer biome discovered in 2016 at the Amazon River mouth, featuring giant sponges and rhodolith in low-light, muddy waters spanning Brazil to French Guiana. The reef faces threats from oil exploration by Total and BP, with drilling blocks just eight kilometers away risking spills that could harm the ecosystem and endangered species like manatees, turtles, and otters. The Esperanza ship is embarking on an expedition to explore the reef underwater using submarines, urging supporters to demand companies abandon exploration.
