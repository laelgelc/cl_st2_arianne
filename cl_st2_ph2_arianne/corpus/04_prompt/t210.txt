The 2021 climate crises, including heat waves and floods, signal a "code red for humanity," disproportionately affecting developing nations but now impacting all. Ending corporate greed is vital to redirect super-rich resources from destruction to climate solutions, such as through taxing excessive wealth. Strategies include banning fossil fuel ads, supporting Indigenous resistance, and accelerating renewables. With 183,000 ultra-wealthy individuals wielding outsized influence, taxing them enables systemic change. Marking 50 years since "The Limits to Growth," society remains unsustainable amid rising inequality. Greenpeace allies with the Fight Inequality Alliance to prioritize planetary well-being over private profit, as COVID inequalities preview climate disparities.
