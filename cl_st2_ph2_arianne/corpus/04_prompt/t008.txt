The blog post critiques a UN FAO report claiming meat, eggs, and milk provide essential nutrients difficult to obtain from plant-based foods, making them vital for health, especially for vulnerable groups. It highlights how this aligns with meat industry messaging, with the report reviewed by livestock organizations like the Global Dairy Platform and International Meat Secretariat. Some authors are linked to the pro-meat Dublin Declaration, raising objectivity concerns. This contrasts with evidence from EAT-Lancet and nutrition bodies showing well-planned plant-based diets meet nutritional needs. The post compares meat industry tactics to those of fossil fuels, downplaying climate impacts.
