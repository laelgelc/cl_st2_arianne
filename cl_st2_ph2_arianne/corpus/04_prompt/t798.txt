The blog post marks International Human Rights Day on December 10th, leading to the 70th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, highlighting climate change as a human rights crisis. It details how 50 major investor-owned carbon producers caused 16% of global temperature rise and 11% of sea level rise from 1880-2010. A national inquiry in the Philippines, initiated by survivors of Typhoon Haiyan and supported by Greenpeace, investigates these companies' responsibility for climate-related human rights abuses. It urges the companies to attend a December 11th meeting in Manila and calls for public support to demand climate justice and a shift to 100% renewable energy, amid global legal actions.
