Following the Galaxy Note7 fiasco, Samsung faces a crossroads for a fresh start benefiting consumers and the planet. Greenpeace highlighted potential waste from 4.3 million faulty phones, including tonnes of cobalt, gold, silver, and tungsten if not reused. Public and governmental pressure prompted Samsung to acknowledge concerns and review options to minimize environmental impact. The post calls for Samsung to lead by creating durable, repairable devices from recycled materials, aligning with circular economy principles on their website. Greenpeace demands transparency on phone plans and urges rethinking product design, production, and reuse to avoid destruction.
