The blog post highlights the 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Olympics' commitment to renewables, with six venues powered by clean energy and a zero-emissions target. It discusses climate change's impacts on winter sports, including melting snow forcing athletes to seek new training sites and a study finding nine past and future Olympic cities may soon be too warm to host games. It criticizes sponsor Samsung for a 55% emissions rise since 2010 and using only 1% renewables, contrasting this with their taglines, and urges their CEOs to shift to clean energy to combat the crisis.
