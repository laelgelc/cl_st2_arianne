Greenpeace's Arctic Sunrise is sailing south for three months to advocate for an Antarctic Ocean Sanctuary, the world's largest protected area, covering an area six times the size of Italy. A team of campaigners, scientists, and journalists will explore seabed habitats, document fishing impacts on penguins and whales, and highlight threats like overfishing, plastic pollution, and climate change. Leaders from 24 countries and the EU will decide in October 2018. The post urges supporters to sign and share a petition to persuade politicians, emphasizing healthy oceans' role in sustaining wildlife, livelihoods, and the planet.
