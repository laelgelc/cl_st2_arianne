Greenpeace's Rainbow Warrior expedition in the Philippines' Verde Islands revealed plastic pollution affecting even small marine life. Nestlé uses 1.7 million tonnes of plastic yearly, with a 5% increase over five years, 98% in single-use packaging, ranking it third among global plastic polluters. The blog urges Nestlé to phase out single-use plastics, invest in refill and reuse systems, and take responsibility for the "plastic monster" it created. As part of #BreakFreeFromPlastic, activists delivered a plastic monster to Unilever in Rotterdam and are now sailing the Rhine River on the Beluga to confront Nestlé, noting its acknowledgment that recycling alone is insufficient but lacks urgent action.
