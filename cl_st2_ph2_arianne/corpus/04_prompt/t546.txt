Twenty-two Greenpeace USA activists peacefully shut down the busiest U.S. oil shipping channel by suspending from the Fred Hartman Bridge in Baytown, Texas, planning to remain for 24 hours to challenge the fossil fuel industry. The channel handles over 700,000 barrels of oil daily, potentially rising to 2 million. Dramatic footage underscores the climate crisis urgency. Activist Irene Kim highlighted the emergency, urging bold leadership and systemic change, noting communities' suffering from fossil fuels. Greenpeace calls on Democratic debate candidates in Houston to support a Green New Deal and reject fossil fuels.
