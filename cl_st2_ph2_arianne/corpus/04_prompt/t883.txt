Carl Safina, aboard the Greenpeace ship Arctic Sunrise in the high Arctic near Svalbard, documents trawling as shrinking sea ice and warming waters draw fish and vessels northward. Trawling, often dragging nets across the seafloor like ocean bulldozers, causes overfishing, massive bycatch of unwanted species, seafloor destabilization, coral destruction, harm to delicate creatures like anemones and sponges, and crushing of seabed life, reducing fish habitats and food sources. He advocates for trawl-free zones to protect the ocean, noting a recent agreement with retailers and fishing companies to halt expansion until protections are established, emphasizing moral responsibility for future generations.
