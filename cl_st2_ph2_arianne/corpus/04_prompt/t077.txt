The blog post discusses Romania's challenging transition from coal, highlighting past failures in the 1990s that caused job losses and social scars in regions like Jiu Valley. Greenpeace Romania advocates for a just transition to renewables, proposing energy communities and prosumers—former miners producing and consuming electricity via photovoltaic systems—to preserve local identity and combat energy poverty. Authorities have incorporated these ideas into the Just Transition Plans, funded by EU programs, including subsidies for household solar panels and small-scale renewables for public buildings. A 2032 coal phaseout is set via the Decarbonisation Law, with plans for workshops to establish legal frameworks.
