The Greenpeace blog post exposes the fossil fuel industry's decades-long involvement in unlawful activities, including lies about the climate crisis and 26 examples of credibly alleged or proven crimes by Europe-based companies like Shell, TotalEnergies, and Equinor. It highlights corruption as the most recurrent offense, emerging greenwashing, and severe impacts in the Global South, such as in Nigeria and Sudan. The industry drives one-third of global emissions, exacerbating climate disasters like Pakistan's floods and Philippine typhoons. Greenpeace calls for halting new projects, accountability, and climate justice to end these crimes.
