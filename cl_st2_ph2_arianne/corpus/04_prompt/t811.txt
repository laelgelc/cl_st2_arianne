Greenpeace USA evaluated 17 major smartphone, tablet, and PC producers on three key areas: renewable energy transition, reducing resource consumption, and eliminating hazardous chemicals. Highlights include Apple's leadership in 100% renewable supply chains, while Samsung and Huawei lag in reporting emissions. Fairphone, Dell, and HP lead in durable, repairable designs to combat e-waste, but many companies still use PVC and BFRs. The average grade was D+, with Fairphone scoring B. The post urges public action via tweets to companies like Samsung, Huawei, and Amazon, and shares facts on electronics' environmental impact, re-launching the Guide to Greener Electronics.
