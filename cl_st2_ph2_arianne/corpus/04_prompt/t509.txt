The anonymous author recounts a visit six months ago to the Geraizeiros community in Bahia, Brazil, with journalists, where armed men posing as police intimidated them with assault rifles, demanding entry without warrants or identification. The men left after two hours but threatened to return, leaving the community in fear. This reflects ongoing violence from agribusiness expansion, like Agronegócio Estrondo, which has deforested vast areas for soya farming, invading traditional lands. Soya is sold to traders Cargill and Bunge, supplying fast food chains. The post highlights connected human and environmental rights abuses and urges demanding change.
