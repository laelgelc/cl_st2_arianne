The blog post critiques the ineffectiveness of protected areas in halting biodiversity decline, noting their massive expansion since 1965 yet accelerating losses in terrestrial and marine species. Authors Mora and Sale argue that "paper parks" fail due to poor management, poaching, development, pollution, and global warming, which transcend boundaries.
