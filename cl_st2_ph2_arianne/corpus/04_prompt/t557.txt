Forest fires rage across over five million hectares in Siberia, with less than 90% managed. A Greenpeace Russia team documented the catastrophe in Krasnoyarsk, interviewing locals enduring thick smoke causing headaches, respiratory issues, and health risks like toxins and carcinogens. Residents, including children, suffer indoors and out, with no escape as haze blankets vast areas. Fires burn in "zones of control" where extinguishing is optional. A Greenpeace petition with over 400,000 signatures prompted proposed law changes to shrink these zones, boost fire protection budgets, and avert future wildfires, saving forests and reducing CO2 emissions.
