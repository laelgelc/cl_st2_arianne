Veronica, a Jakarta mother of two, shares her experience as a plaintiff in a 2021 lawsuit against Indonesian officials for failing to ensure clean air. The court ruled the government negligent, mandating air quality standards and public-involved strategies, though not declaring it a human rights violation. She feels relieved yet anxious about implementation, amid ongoing issues like deforestation, forest fires, and urban tree loss. Veronica urges public awareness, government transparency, strict sanctions on polluters, and small actions like using public transport to protect vulnerable groups from pollution's health and economic impacts.
