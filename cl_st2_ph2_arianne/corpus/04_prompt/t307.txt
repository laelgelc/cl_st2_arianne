The blog post exposes the dark side of illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing, a billion-dollar industry linked to murder, slavery, corruption, and deception. It highlights Sea Shepherd's 110-day chase of a notorious poaching vessel and statistics showing 8-14 million metric tons of illegal fish worth $9-17 billion annually, including $2.4 billion in U.S. imports in 2019. The post discusses the perilous role of fishery observers, as explored in the documentary "Murder at Sea," and human rights abuses like modern slavery in films "Buoyancy" and "Ghost Fleet," featuring activist Patima Tungpuchayakula's rescue efforts.
