Four years after Angela Merkel committed Germany to a 40% greenhouse gas emissions cut by 2020 at the Paris Climate Agreement, three organic farming families—the Blohms, Lütke Schwienhorsts, and Backsens—are suing the government for climate inaction, marking the first such federal court defense. Germany has abandoned its targets amid rising temperatures impacting global agriculture. The Blohms face reduced apple yields and pest invasions, forcing cherry tree removal; the Lütke Schwienhorsts endure prolonged droughts threatening their business; and the Backsens confront rising sea levels endangering their island farm's future. Supporters are urged to join calls for accountability.
