Instead, they deposit the money in a safe account until policies align with the Paris Agreement. It warns of stranded fossil fuel assets risking an economic meltdown like 2008, urges scaling up global divestment efforts by institutions and individuals, and cites a UN report needing $90 trillion for renewable solutions to meet climate goals.
