Corporations have created a plastic monster, with over 90% of plastics unrecycled and production set to quadruple by 2050, making recycling insufficient. A growing global movement, with over 3 million supporters and 1,400 allies in Break Free From Plastic, conducted 239 cleanups across 42 countries to identify top polluters. Greenpeace's "Crisis of Convenience" report surveyed 11 major companies, revealing no comprehensive plans to abandon single-use packaging despite commitments; most plan increases. Greenpeace is deploying ships Rainbow Warrior and Beluga to highlight pollution origins, urging companies like Nestlé and Unilever for transparency, reduction, and alternatives to slay the plastic monster.
