The blog post describes the collapse of a Vale-operated tailings dam in Brumadinho, Brazil, releasing 13 million cubic meters of toxic mining waste, killing 110 people and leaving over 230 missing. It severely impacted the Pataxó Hã-hã-hãe Indigenous community's Naô Xohã village, contaminating the Paraopeba River and preventing fishing and bathing. Leaders Hayô and Werymerry express despair, referencing the 2015 Mariana disaster, and oppose mining on Indigenous lands. The community, including vulnerable members, relies on donations, with Greenpeace documenting the tragedy and demanding justice.
