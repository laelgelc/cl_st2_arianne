Oil companies like BP are investing billions in new oil and gas drilling, which, if burned, will exceed the Paris Agreement's 1.5ºC warming limit, worsening climate disasters like floods and wildfires. They rely on unrealistic carbon capture technologies and massive tree planting, which could harm food production and human rights, to offset emissions. This ignores IPCC and IEA warnings that such removals are unfeasible. Instead, emissions must be rapidly reduced, with no new fossil fuels and a phase-down of current production, redirecting funds to clean energy.
