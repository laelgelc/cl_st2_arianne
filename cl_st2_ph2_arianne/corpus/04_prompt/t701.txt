Humanity has breached four of nine ecological boundaries, including nutrient cycles, by overloading watersheds with 8.5 million tonnes of phosphorus and 54 million tonnes of nitrogen annually from agriculture and runoff, causing eutrophication, dead zones, and mass die-offs in lakes like Erie and oceans like the Baltic Sea. The natural nitrogen cycle involves bacteria fixing atmospheric N2 for plants, aided by crop rotation and animals, but human activities have doubled inputs, increased N2O emissions, acidified soils, and reduced biodiversity. Solutions include sparing fertilizer use, managing manure, bioremediation with plants and fungi, and restoring natural ecosystems to respect nature's limits.
