The DRC government auctioned 27 oil and three gas blocks overlapping sensitive ecosystems like peatlands and Virunga National Park, framing it as nationalism to boost the economy and prioritize people over wildlife. Critics argue this enriches elites, entrenches neo-colonialism benefiting foreign powers seeking Russian fuel alternatives, and harms communities through displacement, pollution, and disrupted livelihoods without consultation. True nationalism requires reimagining development via local manufacturing, solar energy, nature conservation, and eco-tourism to foster jobs, good governance, and equitable wealth distribution, questioning the current socio-economic model's effectiveness for Africa.
