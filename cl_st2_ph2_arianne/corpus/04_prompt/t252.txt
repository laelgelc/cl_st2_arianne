The blog post contrasts natural Amazon mist with harmful smoke from deforestation-related fires, highlighting their severe health impacts. A 2020 report notes 2,195 hospitalizations in 2019 for respiratory diseases due to fire pollution, costing BRL 5.64 million, with peaks during fire season. Smoke exacerbates conditions like asthma and increases COVID-19 severity, as seen in Rondônia. Air quality often exceeds WHO limits, affecting children and the elderly most. Fires contribute to climate emissions and biodiversity loss, urging government action to protect the forest for public health.
