The blog post criticizes Brazilian President Bolsonaro's three-year anti-environmental agenda, highlighting a 52.9% rise in Amazon deforestation, fires devastating the Cerrado and Pantanal (which lost a third of its area in 2020), and a 10% increase in greenhouse gas emissions, making Brazil the world's fifth-highest emitter. It notes weakened environmental agencies like IBAMA and ICMBio through budget cuts (30% and 32.7%) and staff reductions (10%), enabling violence against Indigenous peoples and activists (20 killings in 2021, 1,576 land conflicts in 2020). Over 1,500 new pesticides were approved, many EU-banned, amid Bolsonaro's attacks on NGOs and poor handling of COVID-19 and the economy. The post urges preventing his reelection.
