The GAIPE investigation into Berta Cáceres' 2016 murder reveals that DESA, the company behind the Agua Zarca dam, the Honduran government, and financing banks played roles in planning, executing, and covering up the crime starting in November 2015. DESA deployed security, hitmen, and influenced law enforcement to repress Lenca activists opposing the dam. The government protected DESA while denying Berta security and directed forces against opponents. Banks ignored repression. The report highlights rising murders of environmental defenders, with 200 killed globally in 2016, emphasizing systemic attacks in Honduras and the need for justice.
