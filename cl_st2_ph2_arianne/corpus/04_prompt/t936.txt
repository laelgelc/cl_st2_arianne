On World Food Day, Greenpeace highlights celebrations by food lovers and asserts that organic, local, seasonal food beneficial for people and the planet is a human right, accessible to groups like farmers in Argentina, city dwellers in France, children in the Philippines, and foodies in the USA. They urge governments to make ecological food available at fair prices for consumers and farmers. Emphasizing personal action, the post lists five fun ideas: buying and distributing ecological produce, hosting meals with it, cooking for those in need, volunteering at farms or gardens, and pursuing further actions to reform the food system, plus invites reader suggestions.
