Samsung Electronics has committed to 100% renewable energy in the US, China, and Europe by 2020, including its manufacturing factories, following Greenpeace's global campaigns. It plans onsite solar and geothermal installations near its Korean semiconductor plants in Hwaseong, Pyongtaek, and Suwon, while supporting South Korea's goal of 20% renewable energy by 2030. Samsung will join the CDP supply chain program next year to address climate risks. This step addresses its 16,000GWh energy use in 2016, equivalent to the Dominican Republic's, aiding the shift from fossil fuels. Greenpeace urges follow-through and expansion to regions like Vietnam.
