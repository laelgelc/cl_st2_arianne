August Maluka, a Greenpeace Africa mobilisation officer, describes phone calls with his sister in Beira, Mozambique, amid Tropical Cyclone Idai's aftermath. She reports rising death tolls, power outages, long lines for food and water, and bodies washing ashore. Volunteering as a relief worker, she notes pervasive grief, mud-covered streets, and risks of cholera from destroyed water access and poor sanitation, with a vaccination campaign upcoming. Despite the devastation, Maluka highlights African resilience, with communities supporting each other and boatmen rescuing the stranded, revealing their true character in catastrophe.
