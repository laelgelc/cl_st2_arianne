The blog post advocates for cities prioritizing people over cars, noting that over half the world's population lives in cities, projected to reach 70% by 2050. It highlights cars' negative impacts: noise, smell, space consumption, health risks from air pollution killing 4.2 million annually, and climate harm. A Greenpeace report warns only ten years remain to phase out fossil fuel vehicles. The vision includes clean, connected, community-focused cities with benefits like reduced pollution (e.g., Paris' 2015 car-free day cut nitrogen dioxide by 40% and noise by half), more green spaces, active transport infrastructure, and investments in renewable public transit and electric car sharing to cool urban areas.
