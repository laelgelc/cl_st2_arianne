The blog post honors women who helped found Greenpeace nearly 50 years ago, during Women’s History Month, focusing on their roles in the inaugural voyage protesting U.S. nuclear tests near Amchitka Island. Dorothy Stowe co-founded Greenpeace and provided stabilizing leadership. Marie Bohlen proposed sailing to the test site and co-founded the Don’t Make A Wave Committee. Dorothy Metcalfe relayed media reports, encouraged the crew to persist, and lobbied Canadian MPs. Zoe Hunter introduced Bob Hunter to pacifism and helped provision the ships. It notes the all-male crew was a mistake, overlooking women's essential contributions.
