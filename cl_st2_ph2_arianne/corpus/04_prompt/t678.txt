Governments will meet in Hobart, Australia, in late October to decide on creating a vast Antarctic Ocean Sanctuary in the Weddell Sea, spanning nearly two million square kilometers—the largest protected area on Earth. Additional proposals aim to establish a network of sanctuaries. The meeting, run by CCAMLR (24 countries plus the EU), requires consensus, so one objection could block or weaken the EU-proposed sanctuary. It would restrict industrial fishing, protect wildlife like whales and penguins amid global threats like pollution and climate change, and preserve the Antarctic as a key carbon store. Over two million people support it, presenting a major opportunity.
