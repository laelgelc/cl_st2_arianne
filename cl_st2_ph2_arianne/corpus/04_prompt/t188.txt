The Greenpeace blog post recommends environmental films and documentaries, starting with the satirical "Don't Look Up," which allegorizes the climate crisis through a comet threat and scientists being ignored, resonating with Greenpeace co-founder Rex Weyler. It lists others: a documentary debunking meat myths featuring Arnold Schwarzenegger; "Sexy Killer" exposing Indonesia's coal industry scandals; a film on coral bleaching in Australia; Leonardo DiCaprio's global climate journey; the story of Greenpeace's founding; "Parasite" on inequality and climate impacts; Sylvia Earle's ocean advocacy; a minimalism doc promoting less consumption; and stories of Brazilians affected by climate change. It invites readers to share favorites.
