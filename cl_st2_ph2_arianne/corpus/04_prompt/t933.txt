Greenpeace's origins trace back to the 1971 Amchitka nuclear protest, where the Phyllis Cormack crew interacted with Kwakwaka’wakw communities in ‘Yalis, receiving blessings, ceremonial adoption, and a Sisiutl crest as a gift. The sacred symbol, representing balance and protection, was later altered and hybridized for Greenpeace's anti-whaling campaign, constituting cultural appropriation. In 2015, Greenpeace collaborated with Kwakwaka’wakw artist Beau Dick to redesign it, held a renewal potlatch ceremony with apologies, and blessed a ship with the new flag, aiming to correct narratives and retire the old version.
