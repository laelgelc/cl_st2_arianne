Following Greenpeace East Asia's July ranking of 30 global companies on phasing out microbeads in personal care products, several firms responded: Amway Taiwan will replace microbeads with biodegradable ingredients from October 1, 2016, in its sole affected product; LG H&H commits to stopping use by end-2016; a Japanese company pledges phase-out by June 2018, having switched to plant-derived materials since 2014; Procter & Gamble aims for removal by 2017; Shiseido plans global replacement by 2018; and Estee Lauder expanded its commitment.
