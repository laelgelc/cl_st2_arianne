The blog post recounts the 1945 atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, which killed over 214,000 by year's end and caused lasting radiation effects. It discusses Eisenhower's 1953 "Atoms for Peace" speech promoting nuclear power, leading Japan to build its first plant in 1966 and expand despite global incidents like Three Mile Island and Chernobyl. The 2011 Fukushima disaster displaced over 160,000, with many still affected. The author argues nuclear energy is not peaceful, urging Japan to abandon it for renewable energy to foster peace and development.
