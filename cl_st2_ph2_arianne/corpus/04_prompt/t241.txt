The blog post discusses climate injustice, emphasizing that those least responsible for cumulative greenhouse gas emissions suffer most from climate change effects like heat waves, droughts, and storms. It highlights disparities: the US accounts for over 25% of emissions since the 1750s, Africa only 3%; the wealthiest 5% caused 36% of emissions from 1990-2015, while the poorest half contributed less than 6%. Twenty companies are linked to over one-third of recent emissions. Vulnerable regions like small islands and sub-Saharan Africa face existential threats. It calls for accountability, financial aid from wealthy nations, and justice-focused policies at events like the Glasgow conference.
