Greenpeace warns that logging giant Resolute Forest Products is suing Greenpeace entities and Stand.Earth to silence advocacy for forests, oceans, and climate. For years, Greenpeace has campaigned to protect the Great Northern Forest from unsustainable logging, prompting changes from companies like Kimberly Clark. Refusing solutions, Resolute launched major lawsuits. Supporters worldwide are recording voices saying "our voices are vital" to counter this. Milestones include videos from Mark Deklin, Emma Thompson, Tamra Davis, and Jennette McCurdy; a song from Yon Yonson; and digital backgrounds from Hannah Rosengren as recordings reached 10,000.
