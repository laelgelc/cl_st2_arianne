Dorothy Stowe, Greenpeace co-founder, died on July 23, 2010, at 89 in Vancouver. Born in 1920 in Rhode Island to Jewish immigrant parents, she studied English and philosophy, became a psychiatric social worker, and led a union during the McCarthy era. Married to Irving Stowe in 1953, they campaigned against nuclear weapons, drawing from Quaker principles. After immigrating to New Zealand and then Canada, they formed the Don't Make a Wave Committee in 1968, leading to the 1971 Greenpeace voyage that pressured the U.S. to end nuclear tests. The group became Greenpeace in 1972, now global. Dorothy inspired activists worldwide, hosting figures like Bono and Kumi Naidoo, embodying lifelong dedication to peace, justice, and ecology.
