Annisa Rahmawati, a Greenpeace Indonesia forests campaigner, highlights Indonesia's vast biodiversity-rich forests and its high carbon emissions from deforestation and fires, paralleling global crises like the Amazon. She urges companies to drop deforestation-linked suppliers and consumers to demand deforestation-free products across commodities like palm oil, soya, and meat, criticizing government complicity. Greenpeace's 2018 campaign mobilized 1.5 million against Wilmar and Mondelez, leading to Wilmar's NDPE commitments and a joint statement for monitoring. However, 2019 collaborations failed to establish a credible platform, prompting Greenpeace to withdraw.
