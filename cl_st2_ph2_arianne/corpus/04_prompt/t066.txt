Air pollution poses major health risks, with 99% of the global population exposed to unsafe levels per WHO guidelines. Greenpeace India launched the "Power The Pedal" campaign, providing bicycles to low-wage women in Delhi and Bengaluru for empowerment and cleaner transport, and delivered a petition with an art installation to revise air quality standards. In Indonesia, Greenpeace supported a successful lawsuit upholding citizens' right to clean air in Jakarta. In Malaysia, they filed a human rights complaint, created murals and art installations, and demanded a Clean Air Act via a banner. In Colombia, a clean air capsule highlighted pollution in Bogotá.
