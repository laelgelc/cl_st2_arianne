Rex Weyler reflects on 50 years of activism, inspired by mentor Ira Sandperl's secret to organizing: "Be organized." He emphasizes seeking truth through relentless research, avoiding echo chambers and confirmation bias, embracing deep diversity of ideas, and practicing deep ecology to understand nature's workings. Solutions should localize, focusing on community ecosystems and self-reliance. Creativity thrives in inclusive environments, while addressing overshoot—the deeper crisis beyond climate change—requires reduced consumption. Effective communication uses narratives to disrupt cultural myths, and personal growth involves self-examination and quieting the ego.
