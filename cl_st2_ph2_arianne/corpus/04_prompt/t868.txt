Samsung is recalling 4.3 million Galaxy Note 7 phones after nearly 100 explosion cases, equivalent to 730,000 kilograms of technology, and plans to dispose of them without repairing, refurbishing, or reselling. The company sold 1.8 million in 10 countries and is collecting them globally. Greenpeace urges transparency in publishing disposal plans, avoiding dumping or burning to prevent waste and environmental harm, and ensuring safe recovery of precious materials like gold, cobalt, and tungsten through dismantling and reuse. This crisis offers Samsung a chance to lead in innovative electronics design and recycling.
