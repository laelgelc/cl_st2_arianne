Governments recently met in Hobart, Australia, to negotiate a new Antarctic Ocean Sanctuary, but it failed due to opposition from Russia, China, and Norway, with Russia and China using delaying tactics. Despite support from 22 of 25 countries, the Antarctic Ocean Commission (CCAMLR) requires unanimous agreement, allowing minorities to block progress. This leaves Antarctic wildlife vulnerable to overfishing, pollution, and climate change. The post calls for broader systemic changes, including a new UN global ocean treaty to protect one-third of the world's oceans, and vows to continue the campaign with 2.7 million supporters.
