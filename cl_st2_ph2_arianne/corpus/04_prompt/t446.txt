The COVID-19 crisis exposes flaws in socio-economic systems, highlighting vulnerability and interdependence, and calls for a green, just transition to resilient practices within ecological limits. It advocates rethinking production, consumption, work, and more through commons-based models like distributed manufacturing, open access licensing, Distributed Cooperative Organizations (DisCOs), platform cooperatives, and farmland trusts. Commons involve resources, communities, and governance rules, exemplified by Wikipedia, community-supported agriculture, and open-source responses to the pandemic. The movement promotes care, openness, collaboration, and abundance, complementing degrowth and ecofeminism for fairer, participatory alternatives.
