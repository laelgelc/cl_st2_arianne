The Salish Sea, spanning coastal waters off British Columbia and the US northwest, is a biologically diverse ecosystem supporting over 200 bird and mammal species. It faces risks from the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion, which will increase tanker traffic sevenfold, carrying tar sands oil and heightening noise pollution and oil spill dangers. Highlighted species at risk include the giant Pacific octopus, known for its size and speed; endangered southern resident orcas, threatened by noise and spills; clever sea otters vulnerable to oil; migrating grey whales; and record-holding leatherback turtles. Written by Greenpeace USA climate campaigner Vicky Wyatt.
