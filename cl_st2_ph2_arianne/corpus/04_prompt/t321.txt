The blog post, part of the "LIVE from the Pacific" series, recounts a ship's voyage from the Caribbean to the Pacific via the Panama Canal, involving a two-day queue, nine-hour crossing through six locks, and half-day mast maintenance, totaling three days. Crew observed wildlife like cranes, waterfowls, and a crocodile during the transit, with precautions against Canal staff due to the pandemic.

Caribbean sightings included flying fish and seabirds like pelicans and boobies.
