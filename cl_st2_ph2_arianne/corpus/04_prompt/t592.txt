Nine years ago, major brands promised to end deforestation by 2020, but with 200 days left, forests continue to be destroyed, with an area the size of Spain at risk since the pledge. Greenpeace surveyed over 50 companies; few responded, and none demonstrated efforts to sever ties with deforestation-linked suppliers like Cargill, which won't meet the deadline. Brazil's Cerrado has lost nearly half its vegetation to soya and cattle farming, threatening indigenous communities. Greenpeace activists disrupted the Consumer Goods Forum Summit to demand action amid a climate and wildlife emergency, urging companies to end deforestation and restore forests or face extinction.
