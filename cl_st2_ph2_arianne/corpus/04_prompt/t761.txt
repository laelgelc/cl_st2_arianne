Read the summary below.

TASK:

Write a blog post based ONLY on the summary provided below:
- DO NOT include titles.
- DO NOT invent information.
- DO NOT include analysis unrelated to the summary.

The blog post encourages people to check in to the Weddell Sea on Facebook to highlight its preciousness and the need for Antarctic protection, joining a global effort. Written by Aakash Naik, a digital campaigner, it contrasts this with typical check-ins and promotes creating the world's largest ocean sanctuary this year to safeguard penguins, whales, and seals from industrial fishing vessels depleting krill near colonies and feeding areas. Mass check-ins can spark conversations and awareness. Instructions include searching for Weddell Sea, posting a comment, and sharing a petition link at www.protecttheantarctic.org.
