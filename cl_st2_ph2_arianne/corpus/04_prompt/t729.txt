USER PROMPT:
Read the summary below.

TASK:

Write a blog post based ONLY on the summary provided below:
- DO NOT include titles.
- DO NOT invent information.
- DO NOT include analysis unrelated to the summary.

The blog post highlights the severe impacts of single-use plastics on oceans, marine life, drinking water, and food chains, with a truckload entering oceans every minute. It criticizes major brands like Coca-Cola and Unilever for inadequate plans focused on recycling rather than reducing production, as over 90% of plastic isn't recycled. It celebrates community-led efforts, such as bans in Mexico and Scotland, and cup discounts in Greece. Readers are urged to join the Plastic-Free Future Facebook group, conduct brand audits, post polluting plastic photos with #IsThisYours?, and use the Million Acts of Blue toolkit for local campaigns.
