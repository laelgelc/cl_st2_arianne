The blog post reflects on past large-scale climate marches in 2019 and notes how the global pandemic has enforced physical distancing, limiting street protests. However, activists worldwide continue demanding climate action through innovative means like online actions, trending hashtags such as #DigitalStrike by Fridays For Future, virtual and holographic marches, distanced physical protests, social media solidarity symbols, and home-projected banners using lights and shadows.
