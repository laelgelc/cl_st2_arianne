On World Fisheries Day, the post highlights small-scale fishing as innovative and sustainable, with fishers adopting low-impact practices and connecting to consumers via a new market valuing product stories and planetary links. This community includes fishers, restaurateurs, retailers, NGOs, and more, using technologies like peer-to-peer platforms, IoT, social media, and blockchain to foster fair seafood. Despite being minor in a high-volume industry, these initiatives blueprint a transition. Greenpeace launches its Roadmap to Fair Fisheries, focusing on Greece, Italy, and Spain while seeking global ties, expressing solidarity with movements for alternative food systems and inviting collaboration.
