The blog post critiques the culture of extravagant consumption leading to massive electronic waste, highlighting planned obsolescence in devices like iPhones, where companies such as Apple design hard-to-repair products and lobby against right-to-repair laws. It discusses destructive mining for minerals, short device lifespans, and annual e-waste exceeding 65 million tonnes.
