The blog post highlights how LGBTQIA2S+ individuals face disproportionate discrimination during climate crises, exacerbating inequalities in housing, healthcare, and resource access. It emphasizes the interconnectedness of queer and climate movements, urging unity for people and the planet. Greenpeace stresses fighting for all, noting the rainbow flag's green for nature. Key issues include higher homelessness rates—120% risk in the US, with LGBTQIA2S+ youth comprising 40% of homeless youth, worse for BIPOC—and vulnerability to pollution and disasters. Examples include trans people denied shelters during Hurricane Katrina, with one jailed, and Aravanis excluded from aid after the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami.
