Greenpeace activists aboard the ship Esperanza protested at the International Seabed Authority's (ISA) 25th Assembly in Jamaica, highlighting the ISA's failure to protect deep oceans from mining. The post outlines four reasons: the ISA is obsessed with exploitation over protection, lacking capacity to address environmental stresses; it ignores concerns by prioritizing company-led, non-independent environmental impact assessments; it favors mining companies, never denying licenses and allowing cozy industry ties; and it undermines a strong Global Ocean Treaty by lobbying for weaker governance. The author urges signing a petition for ocean sanctuaries prioritizing protection.
