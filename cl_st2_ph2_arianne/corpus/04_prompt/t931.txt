The blog post criticizes Herakles Farms' palm oil project in Cameroon, which aimed to destroy 70,000 hectares of forest despite lacking a valid land lease and facing local opposition. The company is accused of intimidating critics, violating judicial independence, and seeking presidential intervention to enforce a burdensome New York arbitration clause for employee grievances. The project is in crisis, with halted operations, minimal development, unpaid rents and taxes, unfulfilled promises, and worker layoffs. New management and investors persist amid lawsuits for unpaid wages and discrimination. Activist Nasako Besingi was convicted for peaceful protests. Greenpeace advocates sustainable land use respecting communities and environment.
