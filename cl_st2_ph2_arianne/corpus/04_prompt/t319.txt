Greenpeace celebrated its 50th anniversary with a global design contest, receiving over 200 entries from supporters worldwide. Judges, including Thai street artist Muebon and representatives from Brazil, Hong Kong, Indonesia, the Philippines, Russia, Norway, and Africa, selected winners capturing the organization's history and future vision. Leire Dominguez from Barcelona won with a design featuring a peace dove forming "50" from a Greenpeace ship, symbolizing evolution from anti-nuclear actions to environmental justice. Russian artist Nickolay Drozdovskiy was shortlisted, inspired by planetary protection. More celebrations and shortlisted shout-outs are upcoming.
