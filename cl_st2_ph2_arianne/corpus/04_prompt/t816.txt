Greenpeace activists took to the streets to photograph people supporting protection of the Great Northern Forest, aiming to safeguard its critical landscapes for unique species and global climate stability. They urge a movement to pressure Essity to stop destroying the forest. Portraits of nearly 300 diverse supporters were brought to a threatened Swedish forest site, facing imminent logging, near a barren clearcut. Quotes from participants emphasize saving old forests for wisdom, roots, and a future of biodiversity and climate stability.
