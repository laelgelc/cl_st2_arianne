Indigenous Peoples in Brazil's North and Northeast regions, facing invasions by land grabbers, loggers, and drug traffickers, have formed Guardians of the Forest groups to monitor and protect their territories. On November 1, 26-year-old Guardian Paulo Paulino Guajajara was murdered by armed loggers in an ambush on his land, while Laércio Souza Silva Guajajara survived being shot. Paulino used technology to document invasions and deforestation. This killing reflects escalating threats under Bolsonaro's agenda and a system of resource extraction profiting multinational corporations. From 2000-2018, 42 Guajajara were murdered; in 2019's first nine months, 160 invasions occurred in 153 Indigenous Lands. Indigenous leaders in Europe are urging global pressure on Brazil to uphold rights and protections.
