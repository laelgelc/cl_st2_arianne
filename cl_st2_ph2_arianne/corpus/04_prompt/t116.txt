GreenAct is an ads-free, community-owned app for Android and iOS, designed to enhance environmental activism by providing instant notifications and access to Greenpeace volunteer communities. Users can log in, participate in activities, groups, and campaigns with Greenpeace or other organizations. Currently available in select countries like Austria, Belgium, and Brazil, it was created with Open Social and acts as a gateway to independently managed communities, each handling user data under their own privacy policies. As part of Greenpeace's tech vision, it aims to support mobilization, with plans to expand as a mobile hub for environmental activism.
