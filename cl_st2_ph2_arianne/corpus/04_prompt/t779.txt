The blog post urges governments and corporations to end fossil fuel addiction urgently. It highlights Samsung, a Winter Olympics sponsor in South Korea, as having the potential to transform the global tech industry by committing to 100% renewable energy. Samsung's energy footprint exceeds that of a small country, with less than 1% from renewables, relying instead on coal despite its PR claims. Greenpeace, supported by thousands, calls on Samsung's CEOs to #DoBiggerThings through global activism in cities like London and New York, and encourages a virtual banner drop via tweets to push for the switch.
