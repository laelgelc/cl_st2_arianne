The blog post criticizes Norway for failing to protect oceans despite its nature-loving image. It highlights Norway's opposition to a strong Global Ocean Treaty, blocking protected areas in the Central Arctic Ocean in 2016 and the Antarctic last year with Russia and China. Norway spends more on oil exploration (€6.9 million) than ocean protection and plans Arctic drilling. Prime Minister Erna Solberg dismisses ocean protection for not creating jobs, ignoring scientific warnings. Less than 1% of coastal areas are protected, far below the 10% promised by 2020, and Norway resists targets like 30% global ocean sanctuaries.
