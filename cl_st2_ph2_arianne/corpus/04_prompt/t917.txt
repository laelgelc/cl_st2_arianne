In April 2014, the Republic of the Marshall Islands filed lawsuits at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) against nine nuclear-armed nations. In March 2016, the ICJ heard preliminary oral arguments from the Marshall Islands against the UK, India, and Pakistan. The cases stem from U.S. nuclear tests (1946-1958) that contaminated the islands, causing severe radiation impacts; in 1985, Greenpeace's Rainbow Warrior aided relocation of Rongelap residents. Tony de Brum recounted children mistaking 1954 radioactive fallout for snow and eating it. The Marshall Islands alleges breaches of international law requiring good-faith nuclear disarmament negotiations. A decision is expected in six months; Greenpeace supports the effort.
