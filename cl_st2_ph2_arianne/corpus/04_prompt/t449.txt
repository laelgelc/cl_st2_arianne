The blog post expresses frustration with neoliberal policies that have limited options during crises like Covid-19 and climate change. It advocates for relocalisation to build resilient, sustainable supply chains that strengthen global communities through internationalism and solidarity, not isolationism. Critiquing free trade for benefiting corporations while harming people and the environment, it calls for rethinking trade rules to prioritize human dignity, fair wages, and ecological sense. Tariffs are presented as potentially useful tools for economic diversification and just transitions, paired with policies like affordable housing and basic income to ensure accessibility.
