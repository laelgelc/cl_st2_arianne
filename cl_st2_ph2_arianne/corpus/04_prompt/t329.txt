The Saya de Malha Bank in the Indian Ocean, part of the Mascarene Plateau connecting Seychelles, Mauritius, and Réunion, hosts diverse wildlife including pygmy blue whales, sperm whales, flying fish, and tuna. It features the world's largest seagrass meadow, a major carbon sink that stores carbon to slow climate breakdown and supports species like dugongs and tiger sharks. Recognized as an Ecologically and Biologically Significant Area under shared Seychelles-Mauritius governance, with international waters. Greenpeace's Arctic Sunrise expedition mapped wildlife using binoculars, hydrophones, and eDNA from water samples. Amid ocean pressures like 71% shark decline from bycatch, it calls for ocean sanctuaries and a Global Ocean Treaty.
