Greenpeace advocates for affordable clothing free from hazardous chemicals. They launched the Detox My Fashion campaign in 2011 and suspended textile product sales in 2012 until transparent proof of chemical-free production. Since then, 80 companies committed to eliminating hazardous chemicals by 2020. The "Destination Zero" report highlights progress in transparency and supply chain improvements, sparking industry initiatives. A 2018 pilot demonstrated feasible Detox-compliant production. From April 2019, Greenpeace trials a new standard for merchandise like t-shirts and bags, using best practices and third-party tools for chemical elimination and transparency, with selected suppliers. The suspension remains broadly in place.
