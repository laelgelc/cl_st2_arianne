The Antarctic, far from sterile, teems with diverse marine life including whales, orcas, seals, fish, seabirds, and unique seafloor species, making it the world's last wild frontier needing urgent protection. Rapid warming on the Antarctic Peninsula affects sea ice and krill, the food web's foundation, while industrial fishing depletes stocks. The Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) can establish marine reserves, but progress since a 2009 agreement has been slow. The Antarctic Ocean Alliance's new publication proposes a network of 19 reserves covering over 40% of the Southern Ocean. At the October 2012 CCAMLR meeting, members can create this network, inspiring global high-seas protection. Sign the petition to urge action.
