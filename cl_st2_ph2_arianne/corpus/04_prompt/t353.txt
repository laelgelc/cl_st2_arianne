The blog post contrasts the ocean's beauty with hidden threats like pollution, overfishing, illegal fishing, eutrophication, climate crisis, and plastic pollution. On International Women’s Day, it celebrates women worldwide fighting to preserve ocean health, social stability, and food security, noting that one billion people rely on fish as their main animal protein source, with 70% in Senegal. In West Africa, women and small-scale fishermen oppose the fishmeal and fish oil (FMFO) industry and foreign vessels overexploiting stocks, exporting products to Asia and Europe, which harms local communities. It calls for government measures, including legal status for women, and invites a global online applause to thank these women.
