Mexico's presidential decree of December 31, 2020, prohibits transgenic corn and phases out glyphosate by 2024 to achieve food sovereignty through sustainable agri-food systems that produce healthy, environmentally friendly food. Greenpeace Mexico, after 21 years of advocacy with various groups, celebrates this as a victory against GMOs and glyphosate, which pose health risks, contaminate ecosystems, and threaten agricultural diversity. The decree bans glyphosate in government programs and GM corn in diets until sustainable alternatives are implemented. Mexico, the origin of 59 corn types and other crops, must advance ecological agriculture to protect biodiversity and heritage, aiming for a pesticide- and GMO-free system without seed privatization.
