A Greenpeace report, 'Food Injustice 2020-22', reveals how 20 major agribusiness corporations in grain, fertiliser, meat, and dairy sectors exploited the COVID-19 pandemic and Ukraine war to amass $53.5 billion in shareholder payouts in 2020-2021, exceeding the UN's $51.5 billion estimate to aid 230 million vulnerable people. Market concentration enables these firms to control supply chains and withhold information, inflating prices and profits. The post calls for food sovereignty, returning power to small-scale farmers, and measures like universal basic income, windfall taxes, and dividend taxation to end hunger and promote social justice amid climate crises.
