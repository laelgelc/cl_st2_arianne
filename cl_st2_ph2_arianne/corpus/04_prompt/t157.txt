Read the summary below.

- DO NOT invent information.
- DO NOT include analysis unrelated to the summary.

The blog post exposes carbon capture and storage (CCS/CCUS) as a scam by oil companies like Chevron and Shell, who use public subsidies to feign climate action while boosting oil production. It details failures such as Australia's Gorgon project capturing only 2% of total emissions targets despite $60 million in handouts, and Shell's Quest plant in Canada emitting more greenhouse gases than it captures. CCS requires extra energy, increasing emissions, and globally captures just 0.1% of annual CO2 after decades, often for enhanced oil recovery. Scientists label it a pipe dream subsidizing fossil fuels.
