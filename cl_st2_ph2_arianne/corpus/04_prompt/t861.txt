USER PROMPT:
Read the summary below.

TASK:

Write a blog post based ONLY on the summary provided below:
- DO NOT include titles.
- DO NOT invent information.
- DO NOT include analysis unrelated to the summary.

The blog post explores finding hope amid ecological crises, arguing that logic and big institutions like governments or corporations offer little, as global capitalism and pre-ecological politics fail to address overshoot. Instead, hope lies in nature's long timescales, wildness, and humility; in simple, local communities restoring habitats; in artists inspiring change; and in modest, persevering people. It draws on figures like Rachel Carson, Wendell Berry, and Leonard Cohen, emphasizing patience, persistence like spawning salmon, and returning to indigenous, place-based living over hubristic management.
