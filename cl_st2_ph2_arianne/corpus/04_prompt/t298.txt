The blog post recounts the community resistance in Prachuab Khiri Khan (PKK), Thailand, against proposed coal-fired power plants starting in 1995. Locals, concerned about environmental impacts, lack of transparency in Environmental Impact Assessments, and illegal land acquisition, used non-violent tactics like protests, billboards, and signs to oppose the projects. Greenpeace Thailand supported the movement, including a 2000 Rainbow Warrior visit. Despite the 2004 assassination of leader Charoen Wataksorn, protests intensified, leading to the government's cancellation of the plants. PKK remains coal-free, thriving on fishing, farming, and tourism, inspiring ongoing activism.
