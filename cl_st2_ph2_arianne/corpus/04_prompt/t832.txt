The blog post argues that overconsumption of fashion, driven by online shopping, fails to bring lasting happiness, as new purchases quickly lose appeal. A survey reveals many people, including two-thirds in Hong Kong and 60% in China, own more than needed, spending hours daily on impulse buys to relieve stress or boredom. However, excitement fades fast, leading to guilt and emptiness. Advertisers exploit desires for self-worth, trapping people in "stuffocation"—a cycle of materialism harming the planet. To break free, slow down: pause before buying, sleep on decisions, and opt for nature over malls.
