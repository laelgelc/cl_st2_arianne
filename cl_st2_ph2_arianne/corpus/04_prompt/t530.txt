Greenpeace photographer Jurnasyanto Sukarno documents Indonesia's forest fire crisis, caused by clearing peatlands for palm oil plantations, leading to toxic smoke. At Palangkaraya's Doris Sylvanus Hospital "Oxygen House," he witnesses a family seeking treatment for their 50-day-old baby Rafa, who struggles with smoke inhalation. The infant receives oxygen and steam therapy amid emotional distress. Sukarno reflects on the plight of children lacking protective masks and families repeatedly visiting hospitals. He notes the crisis is the worst since 2015, with no government revocation of palm oil licenses or sanctions on companies.
