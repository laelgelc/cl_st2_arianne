The blog post commemorates the 32nd anniversary of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster, highlighting its widespread contamination and ongoing risks in Europe, Belarus, Ukraine, and Russia. It criticizes Rosatom's plan to deploy the world's first floating nuclear power plant, 'Akademik Lomonosov,' in the Russian Arctic to support fossil fuel extraction along the Northern Sea Route.
