Greenpeace East Asia tested 30 major cosmetic brands after finding microplastics in 170 seafood types, ranking them on commitments to eliminate microbeads—tiny plastics in exfoliants that pollute oceans, harm marine life, and enter the food chain. Brands' pledges often have loopholes due to varying definitions, allowing continued use. None met full environmental standards; even top scorers like Beiersdorf only removed polyethylene, ignoring other plastics. The solution is government bans on all solid microplastics in personal care products, as in the US, while consumers can use apps and guides to avoid them.
