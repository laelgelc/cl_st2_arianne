The Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) has disassociated from the Swiss-German timber group Danzer, revoking all its FSC certificates worldwide due to human rights violations in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). This follows a 2011 Greenpeace complaint against Danzer's subsidiary Siforco, which involved illegal logging and calling police and military to suppress community protests in Yalisika, resulting in injuries, property destruction, rape allegations, and one death. Greenpeace welcomes the decision as a signal against unacceptable practices, though it may not rectify past harms. It highlights ongoing violent conflicts in DRC logging and calls for strengthening FSC in high-risk areas.
