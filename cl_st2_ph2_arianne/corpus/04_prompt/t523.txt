The blog post explores the Gaia hypothesis, portraying Earth as a self-regulating living system, drawing from Greek mythology, Indigenous concepts like Mitákuye Oyás’in, and scientific ideas from Howard Odum, Gregory Bateson, Erwin Schrödinger, Herman Daly, Rachel Carson, Ilya Prigogine, Lynn Margulis, and James Lovelock. It discusses life's co-evolution, waste metabolism, atmospheric balance, and evolutionary examples like ancient oxygen crises.
