Greenpeace staff in Helsinki, inspired by a documentation trip, discussed the stunning beauty and logging devastation of the Great Northern Forest. This vast forest spans Canada, Scandinavia, and Russia, holding nearly a quarter of the world's trees, storing more carbon than tropical rainforests, and serving as home to Indigenous peoples like the Sami and Cree, plus diverse wildlife. Only 3% is protected, with logging turning it into disposable products, risking it becoming a carbon bomb. They urge protection to combat climate change and offer an AR app experience via Arilyn to virtually explore its wonders and threats.
