The blog post highlights a 21.97% increase in Amazon deforestation, the highest since 2006, with 13,235 km² destroyed between August 2020 and July 2021 under President Bolsonaro's administration. It criticizes the government for slashing environmental protections, weakening monitoring agencies, and endangering Indigenous Peoples. Released post-COP26, the data exposes Bolsonaro's greenwashing, as the summit's agreement permits further destruction. Deforestation contributes to Brazil's high carbon emissions, health risks from fire smoke, climate imbalance, and violence against Indigenous communities, with 263 killed in 2020. It urges world leaders to reject deals with Bolsonaro, demand deforestation-free supply chains, and support Indigenous sustainable practices.
