The blog post outlines ten reasons against Arctic oil drilling: its extreme danger in a harsh environment; unnecessary due to potential for fuel-efficient vehicles if laws aren't blocked; incompatibility with climate goals in a fragile region; challenges drilling relief wells amid short seasons, risking prolonged spills; impossibility of oil recovery in ice; inadequate response capacity with few ships; slow natural breakdown of oil in cold conditions; vulnerability of wildlife like birds, whales, seals, polar bears, and foxes; high costs, as seen in Cairn Energy's billion-dollar failures; and limited supply equivalent to just three years of global demand, deeming the risks unjustified.
