Greenpeace's blog post details their ongoing fight against palm oil-driven forest destruction, noting that major brands like KitKat, Colgate, Dove, and others source from 24 of 25 notorious Southeast Asian companies. These firms have destroyed over 130,000 hectares of rainforest since 2015, alongside issues like worker exploitation, community conflicts, illegal deforestation, and fires. Despite 2010 promises to buy only from responsible suppliers, brands continue using "dirty" palm oil via trader Wilmar. The post calls for brands to prove non-destructive sourcing and urges public action.
