Greenpeace International's 2017 Annual Report expresses gratitude to supporters amid lawsuits exceeding a billion dollars from Resolute Forest Products and Energy Transfer Partners, aimed at silencing activism. It highlights global achievements, including Make SMTHNG week events promoting creation over consumption, campaigns pressuring Thai Union for sustainable fisheries, EU glyphosate petition, Brazil's Amazon protection, and Samsung's policy shift on Galaxy phones. The organization emphasizes diversity, inclusion, and #MeToo integration, while detailing unseen work like campaign planning, training, scientific support, and ship management. It celebrates successes in coal phase-outs, divestment, and exposing unfair trade deals, urging continued collaboration for a sustainable planet.
