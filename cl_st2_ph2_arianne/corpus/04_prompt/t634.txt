A Polish TV investigation exposed diseased cows being dragged to slaughter in pain and their rotten meat distributed without veterinary checks to 14 European countries, including school canteens. This scandal highlights ongoing issues in industrial meat production, like mad cow disease and listeria, driven by profit-seeking and weak oversight. In Poland, high percentages of diseased livestock are still approved for consumption. The system harms public health, animals, and the environment, contributing to deforestation, pollution, and climate crisis. The post urges better regulation, transparency, and a shift to plant-based diets, with individuals advocating for eco-friendly school meals and using the Greenpeace Cookbook for inspiration.
