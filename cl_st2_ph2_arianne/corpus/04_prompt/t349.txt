The Greenpeace ship Arctic Sunrise is in the Indian Ocean this month to document and expose threats to the oceans. The region hosts diverse wildlife and ecosystems, including pygmy blue whales, dugongs, colorful coral reefs, and the world's largest seagrass meadow. Millions of coastal and island residents depend on the ocean for food and livelihoods. Industrial fishing and climate breakdown are depleting marine life. Governments worldwide must act to protect the oceans—join the journey.
