Greenpeace criticizes COP26 for boosting carbon offsetting scams that endanger Indigenous Peoples, biodiversity, and the 1.5°C goal, with unverifiable benefits often leading to land grabbing and displacement. Examples include airlines offsetting flights via forest protection, TotalEnergies' Congo peatland drilling compensated by non-native tree farms, and JBS's net-zero plan ignoring methane emissions while fueling Amazon destruction. A video series exposes this greenwashing, advocating "real zero" through actual emission cuts, phasing out fossil fuels and industrial meat, protecting rights, and shifting to renewables and plant-rich diets, without offsets.
