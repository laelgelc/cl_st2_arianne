The blog post describes a recently clearcut logging site in the Great Northern Forest, where ancient trees have been reduced to a barren wasteland, destroying habitats for insects, birds, mushrooms, and lichen. Forest campaigner Lina Burnelius from Greenpeace Nordic blames Essity, producer of Tempo and the world's second-largest tissue company, for sourcing pulp from suppliers expanding into critical biodiversity-rich forests in Sweden, Finland, and Russia. It urges Essity to protect these areas by using sustainable forestry outside critical landscapes and recycled materials, calling on readers to demand a cleaner supply chain.
