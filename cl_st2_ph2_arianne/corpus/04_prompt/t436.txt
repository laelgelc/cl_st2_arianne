On Philippine Independence Day, amid Metro Manila's 89-day COVID-19 quarantine—the world's longest—ending June 15 without flattening the curve or mass testing, the Anti-Terrorism Bill threatens to criminalize opposition by broadly defining terrorism, allowing executive tagging of activists as terrorists without warrants, up to 24-day detentions, and 90-day surveillance. It violates the Constitution and international law, neglects vulnerable groups like Muslims and Lumads, stifles activism amid poverty, pandemic, and climate crises, and prioritizes suppression over real threats, while the government pushes business-as-usual recovery like mining and bailouts. Greenpeace supports communities for a #BetterNormal.
