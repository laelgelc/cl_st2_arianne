Greenpeace's Detox Outdoor campaign surveyed major outdoor brands on PFC use, revealing widespread contamination in products. Over 30,000 votes selected 40 items for testing, with PFCs detected in all but four, including high levels of hazardous long-chain PFCs and PFOA in gear from The North Face and Mammut. These persistent chemicals pollute remote areas, enter food chains, and affect wildlife and humans. UK brand Páramo committed to Detox, eliminating PFCs entirely, joining 34 others. The outdoor community is urged to pressure brands like Mammut and The North Face to stop using toxic chemicals and protect nature.
