The blog post describes the Saya de Malha Bank, a remote Indian Ocean underwater plateau the size of Belgium, hosting the world's largest seagrass meadow, shallow corals, and abundant marine life including endangered turtles, sperm whales, and pygmy blue whales. Seagrass meadows capture significant CO2 and serve as nurseries, but are declining due to human activity. It highlights threats from industrial fishing by EU vessels using purse seine nets and longlines, causing overfishing of yellowfin tuna and bycatch of turtles, whales, and sharks. The post calls for a strong Global Ocean Treaty to create sanctuaries in international waters and urges signing a petition.
