Oreo's "Wonderfilled" slogan features videos, TV campaigns, and a song, but its maker, Mondelez, sources palm oil from Wilmar, the world's largest and dirtiest trader linked to forest destruction and human rights abuses in Indonesia. Countries like Italy, Japan, France, and Indonesia are recognizing that companies producing palm oil for Oreo cookies are trashing rainforests. Greenpeace volunteers worldwide have protested to expose this. Over a million people signed a petition urging Oreo to stop buying from forest destroyers; join them to protect forests and dependent lives.
