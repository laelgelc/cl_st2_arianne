The human population has reached 8 billion, with over half living in cities, which produce 70% of CO2 emissions and can drive radical climate transformations. Urban growth over the next 30 years will occur mainly in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean, where cities face social and climate challenges. A justice approach to climate change requires protecting and including marginalized people. The post gathers voices from frontline cities of individuals working for healthier, greener urban spaces. Urban Justice involves addressing inequalities intersectionally, recognizing local solutions for new models centered on climate and social justice, and grassroots movements pushing for inclusion in decision-making. What does #UrbanJustice mean to you?
