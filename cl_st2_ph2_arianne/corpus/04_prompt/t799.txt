Gazprom plans to build the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline through the unique Kurgalsky Nature Reserve in North-West Russia, home to rare species like the Baltic ringed seal, black-throated loon, ruddy turnstone, garden dormouse, peregrine falcon, golden eagle, and a recently discovered white-tailed sea-eagle nest. The pipeline would cut a 3.7 km scar through old-growth forests, causing irreversible damage. Over 38,000 Russians have sent letters to the Ministry of Natural Resources to oppose it, and Greenpeace Russia has filed a Supreme Court lawsuit. The post urges action to prevent this fossil fuel project, as the world shifts to renewables.
