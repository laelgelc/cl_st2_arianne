Cho Sun-Hee, a Seoul-based celebrity photographer, collaborated with Greenpeace Korea on a W magazine photoshoot to leverage celebrities' influence in raising awareness about environmental issues like single-use plastics and climate change impacts, including heatwaves, typhoons, and altered seasons. She emphasizes limiting disposables, the need for government and corporate action, public education—especially in schools—to inspire individual efforts, and using digital editing for visuals on challenges like rising sea levels and solutions like renewable energy. The project deepened her personal commitment, influenced by her son, and highlighted celebrities' sincere participation.
