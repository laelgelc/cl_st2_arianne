Over 5 million people worldwide have demanded companies like Nestlé reduce single-use plastic production. To push for systemic change, join Global Refill Day on November 6 by taking a reusable container to a supermarket, cafe, or restaurant, requesting a fill, photographing before and after, and sharing on social media with #ReuseRevolution, #BreakFreeFromPlastic, tagging the company and @greenpeace. This promotes refillable systems over throwaway packaging, inspired by initiatives like Indonesia's Zero Waste Living Lab, refill stations, zero waste cities, and celebrity commitments. Recent brand audits identified Coca-Cola, Nestlé, PepsiCo, Mondelez, and Unilever as top polluters. Explore more actions via Break Free From Plastic's Global Week of Action.
