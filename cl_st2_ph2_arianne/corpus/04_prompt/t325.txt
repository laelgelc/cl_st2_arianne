The blog post expresses hope for a post-pandemic 2021 with renewed normalcy, but notes that challenges persist as the "new normal." It highlights climate change-linked threats, including Kenya's desert locust invasions risking food security and raising concerns over harmful pesticides. The year began with global extreme weather: Beijing's sandstorms, Australia's floods after bushfires, Nepal's forest fires, Angola's deadly flash floods, Spain's record snowstorm, Indonesia's floods from land clearing, South Korea's coldest day in decades, Cyclone Eloise devastating Mozambique and nearby countries, Texas's polar vortex causing blackouts, and Amazon floods affecting Indigenous communities.
