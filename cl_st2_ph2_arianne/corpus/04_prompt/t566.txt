Steve Sawyer, a key Greenpeace leader, passed away on July 31, 2019, from lung cancer. He served as Executive Director of Greenpeace International from 1988, overseeing triumphs like protecting Antarctica from oil exploration, the Montreal Protocol on ozone-depleting gases, ending sea radioactive waste dumping, and early climate change campaigns. Later, as General Secretary of the Global Wind Energy Council, he boosted wind power growth from 74GW to 539GW globally. Sawyer's early activism included the Rainbow Warrior's missions, such as relocating Rongelap atoll residents and protesting nuclear tests, surviving the 1985 French bombing. He is remembered for his courageous leadership, love of nature, and personal passions like sailing and blues guitar.
