COP27, the 27th UN Climate Summit in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, from November 6-18, 2022, focuses on advancing climate justice and limiting warming to 1.5°C. Key priorities include establishing a loss and damage finance facility funded by polluting nations, rapidly phasing out fossil fuels with no new projects and just transitions, providing $100 billion annually for low-income countries' adaptation and decarbonization, and integrating nature protection with Indigenous involvement. The global climate movement must push governments for urgent action amid growing activism, as recent IPCC reports highlight escalating crises.
