Taiwan's diverse coral reefs are experiencing widespread bleaching due to record-high sea temperatures exceeding 30°C, fewer typhoons, and continuous ocean warming from climate change. Additional causes include pollutants like agricultural pesticides, wastewater, and harmful sunscreen chemicals. Impacts include large-scale coral mortality, ecosystem disruption affecting marine life, coastline erosion protection, tourism, and fisheries, with slow recovery given corals' 1cm annual growth. Prevention requires ambitious carbon reduction by replacing fossil fuels with sustainable energy and ongoing preservation efforts to combat global warming and ocean acidification.
