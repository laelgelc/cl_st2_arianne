The blog post explores the history and benefits of simple living and minimalism, starting with The Minimalists' rejection of consumer-driven lives for greater fulfillment. It traces influences from figures like St. Francis, Quakers, Thoreau, Tolstoy, Gandhi, and Arne Naess, who inspired ecological movements including Greenpeace and deep ecology. Key books such as Diet for a Small Planet, Small Is Beautiful, and Ecotopia advocate reduced consumption for sustainability.
