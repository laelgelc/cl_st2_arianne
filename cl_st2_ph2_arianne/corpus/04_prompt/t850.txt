The blog post discusses the environmental and social impacts of smartphones since 2007, with 7.1 billion produced using over 60 elements, leading to significant mining and processing effects. It highlights 3 million metric tons of e-waste in 2014, with only 16% recycled, and notes that most models lack easily replaceable batteries, contributing to short device lifespans of about 2 years in the US. Manufacturing consumed 968 TWh of energy, equivalent to India's annual supply.
