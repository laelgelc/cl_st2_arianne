Roland Hipp, Managing Director of Greenpeace Germany, celebrates the end of nuclear power in Germany as a people-powered victory after decades of protests against reprocessing plants, waste transport, and new constructions. Key successes include stopping the Wackersdorf plant in 1989, banning waste shipments to Sellafield and La Hague in 2005 after Greenpeace exposed high radiation levels, and rejecting the unsuitable Gorleben repository. He highlights nuclear risks, citing Chernobyl and Fukushima, uranium dependency on Russia, and the lack of safe waste repositories worldwide, urging a shift to renewables for a secure future.
