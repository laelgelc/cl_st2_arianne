The blog post critiques the unsustainable, car-centric vision of future transport promoted by Hollywood and the industry, advocating instead for efficient public systems like trains, buses, and trams that reduce energy use and serve as a social safety net. It highlights successful networks in cities like Moscow, Beijing, and Auckland, and urges reducing cars to improve air quality and reclaim space, as seen in Los Angeles' vast parking areas. Shared electric vehicles are proposed for essential needs, alongside promoting walking and cycling, with examples from London and Copenhagen.
