Sophie Allain recounts Greenpeace's three-year court case with Norwegian youth group Natur og Ungdom, arguing that Arctic oil drilling licenses violate constitutional rights to a healthy environment for future generations. Although they lost in the Court of Appeal, they won key points: Norway's responsibility for emissions from exported oil and confirmation of Article 112's protections. The court ruled licenses do not conflict with the article, prompting an appeal to the Supreme Court. The case highlights Norway's tension between its green ideals and oil economy, amid a global wave of climate litigation and rising activism.
