Greenpeace's Mobility Week features the #MobilityForAll campaign with actions across Europe demanding equitable urban mobility. Highlights include Italy's parking lot transformations for Park(ing) Day; Romania's Critical Mass Bike Ride pushing for 100 km of bike lanes in Bucharest; Belgium's protest against public transport cuts; Hungary's reverse graffiti on Car-Free Day exposing air pollution deaths; and Spain's mobilizations against airport expansions. Pre-week events involved German protests at the IAA against climate-damaging cars and Spain's model train display. The week promotes sustainable transport to cut CO2 emissions, with demands for car-free zones, improved public transport, accessibility, shared mobility, cycling infrastructure, and green spaces.
