The blog post discusses how oil companies are exploiting COVID-19 to promote single-use plastics, spreading misinformation to lobby for bailouts and weaker regulations. It highlights that reusables like cups and bags can be safely used if washed properly, as endorsed by nearly 130 health experts. Plastic is not inherently sanitary; the virus survives longer on it than on cardboard. The post emphasizes washing produce regardless of packaging and notes plastic's environmental harms, including pollution, climate impacts, and waste burdens on low-income communities. Decisions should follow science, not industry lobbyists.
