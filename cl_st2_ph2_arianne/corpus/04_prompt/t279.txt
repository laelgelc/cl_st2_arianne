Emma Mederic, a 23-year-old Seychellois conservationist and Assistant Aldabra Science Coordinator with the Seychelles Islands Foundation (SIF), shares her experiences protecting Aldabra Atoll, a UNESCO marine World Heritage Site and natural laboratory teeming with diverse species like giant tortoises, green turtles, and dugongs. Managed by SIF since 1979, the atoll's research station, established in 1971, promotes evidence-based conservation and gender diversity, including all-female teams. Facing climate change, pollution, and unsustainable fisheries, Emma urges reducing ecological footprints, ending fossil fuels, and supporting a Global Ocean Treaty to safeguard Aldabra and high seas biodiversity.
