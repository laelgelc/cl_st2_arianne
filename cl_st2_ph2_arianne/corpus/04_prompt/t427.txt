The blog post argues that COVID-19 exposes flaws in consumption-driven economies and our reliance on nature, critiquing recycling as inefficient and a distraction from reducing production and consumption. It proposes a "slow circular economy" that prioritizes refusing and reducing waste, incorporating mindful designs like simple, repairable, durable, modular products using local, renewable, non-toxic resources. It criticizes corporations for focusing solely on recycling to sustain growth, while highlighting emerging practices like repair incentives, advertising limits, and alternative models.
