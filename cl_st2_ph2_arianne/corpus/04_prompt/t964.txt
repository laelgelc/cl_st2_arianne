The blog post details fascinating facts about reindeer (Rangifer tarandus), also known as caribou. It describes their annually growing antlers, unique like fingerprints, covered in warm velvet. Reindeer milk is exceptionally rich, with 22% butterfat and 10% protein. Eyes change color seasonally from gold to blue. They are speedy runners, energy-efficient, and adapted for cold with hollow insulating hair, warming noses, and seasonal footpad changes. Males shed antlers in December, while females retain theirs; shed antlers provide minerals for other animals. Knees click, and air sacs enable unique vocalizations. The author is Trillia Fidei-Bagwell from Greenpeace's Arctic campaign.
