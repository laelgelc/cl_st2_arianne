The blog post recounts the history of Shell's Brent Spar, a 1976 oil storage tank made redundant by 1980, containing crude oil, PCBs, heavy metals, and radioactive waste. In 1991, Shell planned to dump it in the North Sea, gaining UK approval as a cost-saving test case. Greenpeace launched a 1995 campaign, occupying the spar, sampling contents, and protesting with the slogan "The sea is not a dustbin." Media coverage, boycotts, and international pressure forced Shell to reverse the decision, mooring it in Norway. This led to a 1998 OSPAR ban on North Sea dumping, with the spar repurposed as a ferry terminal foundation, marking a pivotal Greenpeace victory.
