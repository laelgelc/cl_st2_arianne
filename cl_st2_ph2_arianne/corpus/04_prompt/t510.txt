Shell plans to abandon parts of four old oil rigs in the North Sea's Brent Oil Field, with three containing over 11,000 tonnes of oil that will eventually pollute the sea, setting a toxic precedent. Greenpeace activists protested peacefully on two platforms on October 14th and 15th, hanging banners demanding Shell clean up and stop ocean pollution. In response, Shell seeks an Edinburgh court order to indefinitely ban protests near its platforms, fearing public pressure and government reconsideration. Greenpeace defends the right to peaceful protest in Scottish court on November 28th and calls for public support to amplify their voice.
