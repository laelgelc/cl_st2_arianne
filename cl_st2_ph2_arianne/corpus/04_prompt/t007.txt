Greenpeace calls for a global day of action on June 3 to oppose deep sea mining, ahead of governments' meeting at the International Seabed Authority in Jamaica. The post urges people to join events via a provided map, drawing parallels to preventing offshore oil drilling to avert climate crises. It highlights the failure to agree on ocean protection, leaving the door open for the industry this year, and stresses stopping it to safeguard ecosystems, combat neocolonialism, and counter greenwashing. Risks include loss of deep sea species, disturbed carbon sinks, and impacts on Pacific communities. It encourages sharing a video and using World Oceans Day on June 8 to build on the Global Ocean Treaty momentum against mining.
