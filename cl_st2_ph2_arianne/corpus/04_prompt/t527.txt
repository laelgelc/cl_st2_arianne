Seamounts are underwater volcanic mountains that create wildlife hotspots by upwelling nutrients from the seafloor. Often located in the high seas beyond national waters, they face protection challenges due to regulatory gaps exploited by destructive industries. Greenpeace campaigns for a global ocean treaty to safeguard ecosystems like Mount Vema. On their pole-to-pole journey, they're researching ocean biodiversity and threats. Key facts about Mount Vema: it's 4,600m tall (like 767 stacked giraffes), discovered in 1957/1959 while seeking diamonds but yielding overfished Tristan rock lobsters, now littered with harmful ghost fishing gear, and protectable via a global treaty.
