Aldi, a top ten global retailer expanding in Germany, Europe, the US, and Australia, has joined Greenpeace's Detox movement, committing to eliminate hazardous chemicals from its textile products by January 1, 2020. This reflects growing momentum for cleaner production in the discount sector, joining companies like Marks & Spencer and Coop in proving sustainable, profitable, toxic-free models are feasible. Greenpeace urges retailers to adopt new business models for responsible resource management and product redesign, starting with toxic-free manufacturing. Aldi acknowledges lifecycle responsibility, marking a victory for the four-year Detox campaign.
