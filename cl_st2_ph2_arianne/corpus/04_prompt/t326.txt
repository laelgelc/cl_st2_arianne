On International Workers’ Day, the blog celebrates workers' historical achievements like weekends off and sick pay, highlighting their resilience and collective power. It emphasizes Greenpeace's support for a just transition from polluting industries like fossil fuels and aviation to sustainable ones, ensuring fair treatment through social safety nets, re-training, employment guarantees, and union involvement.
