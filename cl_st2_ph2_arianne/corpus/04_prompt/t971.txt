In his 2014 lecture at the Oxford Martin School, Kumi Naidoo discussed civil disobedience as essential for the weak to challenge the strong in social justice and ecological crises, drawing from examples like Gandhi, Mandela, Rosa Parks, and the Quakers. He explained how Greenpeace uses non-violent direct action to create narratives exposing industrial destruction, such as confronting whaling fleets in 1975 and nuclear waste dumping in 1978. This shifts public discourse, reveals lies, and leverages moral truth, as power corrupts and denies realities like climate change, requiring action over mere explanation.
