Greenpeace's two-year campaign aboard the Esperanza ship aimed to highlight the Amazon Reef's wonders and protect it from oil drilling by companies like Total. With over 2 million global Amazon Reef Defenders, including scientists and local communities, they achieved a historic victory: Brazil's Ibama denied Total's drilling license. Actions ranged from capturing the reef's first images to disrupting a Total meeting. This defeat of a powerful company signals the growing movement to end the oil age, but the fight continues for full reef protection. Supporters are hailed as heroes.
