The Kamchatka peninsula in Russia experienced a massive die-off of benthic marine organisms, with seawater changing color, emitting an unpleasant smell, and causing health issues like sore throats and nausea among locals, including surfers. Dead animals washed ashore, killing 95% of seabed life near a UNESCO site. Greenpeace Russia investigated by taking samples, using drones, and consulting experts, while demanding an independent probe into the unknown cause—possibly natural like toxic algae or human-related like waste dumping. The group highlights Russia's environmental problems, urges a green economic transformation, and references the Norilsk oil spill to advocate for renewable energy and policies protecting people and nature.
