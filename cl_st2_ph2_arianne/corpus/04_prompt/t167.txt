The blog post challenges Pepsi to surpass Coca-Cola's commitment of 25% reusable or refillable packaging by 2030, noting Pepsi's current 0% and its pledge to set a reuse goal by end of 2022. It highlights the century-old rivalry, the plastic pollution crisis linked to climate change, and both companies' roles as top polluters via single-use plastics. Reuse systems are essential to reduce ocean waste, requiring infrastructure and collaboration. The author urges pressuring Pepsi's CEO before the May shareholder meeting for at least 50% by 2030.
