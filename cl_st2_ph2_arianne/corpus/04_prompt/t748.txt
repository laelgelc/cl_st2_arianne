The Munduruku Indigenous People have inhabited the Tapajós River area in the Brazilian Amazon for centuries, with over 12,000 relying on it for food, transportation, and cultural practices. They've fought for three decades to protect their land from threats like the São Luiz do Tapajós dam, which was halted last year with Greenpeace and global support, though 40 more dams are planned. To secure official recognition, they created the "Map of Life" over two years, depicting their interdependence with nature. This week, they joined 3,000 Indigenous People in Brasília to demand territorial protection, delivering the map to the Ministry of Justice. Dams would flood vast areas, harming biodiversity and communities; over 1.2 million have petitioned in solidarity.
