A single student's act of courage sparked the global school strikes movement, now one of the largest climate actions worldwide, with young people protesting in countries including Vietnam, Kenya, Russia, Kosovo, Solomon Islands, Canada, Seychelles, Pakistan, Antarctica, Afghanistan, and Bangladesh.
