The blog post celebrates the EU-wide ban on fipronil pesticide in agriculture starting today, benefiting bees, bumblebees, butterflies, and other insects. It highlights fipronil's role in a 2017 egg contamination scandal affecting 49 countries, exposing flaws in the food system, and its toxicity to pollinators from seed treatments. Greenpeace campaigned for its 2013 restrictions and now full prohibition. It warns of ongoing threats from neonicotinoids, urging further bans based on evidence. The post advocates shifting from industrial to ecological farming to tackle climate change, biodiversity loss, and pollution, with upcoming EU Common Agricultural Policy reform as an opportunity. It suggests 12 actions for an eco-food revolution.
