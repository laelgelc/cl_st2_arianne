Jenni Laiti, a Sámi artist and activist, describes Sápmi as the traditional Indigenous territory of the Sámi people across northern Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Russia, where land shapes their culture, spirit, and survival. She highlights threats from government and corporate exploitation, including mines, logging, and a proposed Arctic Railway to enable global trade via melting sea ice. The railway would divide land, disrupt reindeer migration, cause accidents, and spur more industrialization like pulp mills and logging, destroying vital forests essential for reindeer and Sámi identity. She links this to IPCC warnings on climate change, urging collective action to protect forests for global survival.
