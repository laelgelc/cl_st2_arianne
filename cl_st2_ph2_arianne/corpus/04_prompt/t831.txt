The blog post explains SLAPPs (Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation) as tactics used by corporations like Resolute Forest Products to silence critics through meritless lawsuits. It details Resolute's CAD$7 million suit in Canada against Greenpeace Canada and CAD$300 million U.S. suit against Greenpeace entities, Stand.earth, and individuals, using RICO laws to claim fraud. An example highlights Uniontown, Alabama residents sued for USD$30 million over a coal ash landfill, who settled with ACLU help for better protections. It notes rising SLAPPs despite anti-SLAPP laws in some areas and offers the "Stand FIRM" acronym to resist: Fight back, Investigate, Rally, Make noise.
