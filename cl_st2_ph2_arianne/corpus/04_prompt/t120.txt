The blog post highlights that reuse and refill systems are longstanding traditions in many countries, predating the recent surge in single-use plastics driven by corporate greed from brands like Nestlé, Unilever, Coca-Cola, and PepsiCo since the 1960s. It calls for holding corporations accountable to shift toward reuse, emphasizing systemic change alongside individual actions. Global South countries lead with innovative models: India's Dabbawalla and thali systems; African bans on single-use items; Chile's refillable bottle mandates and Brazil's successful returnables; and the Philippines' Zero Waste movement with Wala-Usik stores. It promotes a reuse revolution and references a database of initiatives.
