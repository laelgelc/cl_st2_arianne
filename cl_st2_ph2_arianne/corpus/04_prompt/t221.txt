Awa Traore reflects on COP26 with mixed feelings, criticizing profit-driven corporations and leaders for ecosystem destruction and Indigenous land threats. She urges Global North to acknowledge exploitative capitalism, while Global South prioritizes people over carbon offsets. Hope stems from people power, including Indigenous activists and youth confronting leaders for climate, economic, and racial justice. COP26 failed to limit warming to 1.5C, deliver $100 billion in finance, or fund loss and damage, instead promoting unfair carbon trading that harms the Global South. She calls for stronger resistance to center people and planet at COP27.
