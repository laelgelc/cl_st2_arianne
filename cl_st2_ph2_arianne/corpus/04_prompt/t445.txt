Read the summary below.

TASK:

Write a blog post based ONLY on the summary provided below:

- DO NOT invent information.
- DO NOT include analysis unrelated to the summary.

The blog post discusses a global triple crisis—public health, economic, and ecological—requiring just solutions like unconditional international debt cancellation for the global south to enable post-COVID recovery. It advocates freeing resources for a just, green future with zero deforestation, no fossil fuel or mineral expansion, ecosystem restoration, and learning from Indigenous Peoples' ways. Debt burdens force extractivist models causing environmental destruction, as seen in Argentina facing potential default on $65 billion debt. Greenpeace calls for immediate debt cancellation and non-debt-creating emergency finance to prioritize health, wellbeing, and a sustainable economic model.
