Sprite's supplier, La Moraleja S.A., illegally deforested 3,000 hectares of protected native forests in Argentina for lemon juice production, violating the 2007 National Forest Law and harming wildlife and climate defenses. Greenpeace exposed this since 2013, pressuring Sprite and its parent Coca-Cola, which claims sustainability focus. Over 300,000 people demanded action, leading to La Moraleja losing Rainforest Alliance certification and committing to restore only 1,400 hectares. The post urges full restoration of all 3,000 hectares and a zero deforestation policy, calling for petition signatures to hold Sprite accountable.
