Nathalie Wamja, a Greenpeace volunteer in Douala, Cameroon, describes how plastic waste causes recurring floods by blocking drains, ruining homes, livelihoods, water quality, food, and even lives. Motivated by affected family and friends, she observed plastic bottles and packaging clogging gutters despite import bans. She advocates for a total ban on plastic production and imports to promote sustainable alternatives like refill and reuse. Daily, she lives plastic-free, reuses items, educates vendors, shares awareness via WhatsApp articles and petitions, organizes clean-ups with associations, and conducts brand audits to identify polluting companies, noting clean-ups are insufficient without systemic change.
