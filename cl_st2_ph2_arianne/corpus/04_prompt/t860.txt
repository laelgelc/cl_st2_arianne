The blog post emphasizes the critical need to protect biodiversity to maintain a habitable planet, urging governments at the Cancun CBD summit to admit failures and commit to bold protections for areas like the Great Northern Forest and Arctic Ocean. It highlights alarming biodiversity declines, including a forecasted two-thirds drop in animal species by 2020 from 1970 levels. Governments' 2010 pledges for 10% ocean protection and sustainable forest management by 2020 remain unfulfilled, with only 3% of oceans protected and forests like the vast Great Northern Forest—home to communities, species, and the largest carbon store—threatened by logging, fires, and climate change. It calls for public action to ensure fair sharing of resources.
