James (Jon) Castle (1950-2018) was a legendary Greenpeace captain known for his maritime skills, courage, and integrity, guided by principles of right and wrong. He skippered ships in campaigns against whaling, French nuclear testing in the Pacific, and Shell's Brent Spar oil tank disposal in 1995, leading occupations that sparked global protests and policy changes, including a North Sea dumping ban. Castle advocated moral courage, self-reflection, and resistance to corporatism in activism. He participated in protests like the Diego Garcia invasion and later helped run a soup kitchen. Colleagues remember him as compassionate and inspiring.
