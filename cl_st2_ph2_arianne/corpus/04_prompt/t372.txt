In 2020, 'lockdown' was named Word of the Year amid the COVID-19 pandemic, which disrupted lives with isolation and health precautions. Meanwhile, environmental crises intensified: Greenpeace's 'Protect The Oceans' voyage inspected ships and documented Antarctic climate impacts; Kenyan farmers adopted ecological practices for climate resilience; massive wildfires ravaged California and Australia, killing wildlife and people; typhoons flooded the Philippines, prompting demands for climate justice; a Kamchatka disaster killed marine life, leading to government action; deforestation threatened the Amazon and Gran Chaco; coral bleaching hit the Great Barrier Reef; and global floods affected millions. The post applauds activists documenting these threats.
