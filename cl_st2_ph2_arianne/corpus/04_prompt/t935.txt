Greenpeace addresses concerns from the film Cowspiracy, denying any meat industry funding and clarifying their independent stance. They campaign against animal agriculture's environmental impacts, including its 18% share of global greenhouse gas emissions and role in Amazon deforestation. Efforts focus on cattle ranching, soya for animal feed, and destructive fishing, yielding victories like Nike halting Amazon leather purchases, a World Bank loan withdrawal, McDonald's soya reforms, and improved tuna fishing practices. While promoting veganism and reduced meat consumption, they emphasize systemic changes over individual mandates, considering cultural and accessibility factors, aiming for 50% meat/dairy reduction by 2050.
