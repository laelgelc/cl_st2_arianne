The blog post highlights women's frontline role in resistance against oppressions, exemplified by the Iranian feminist uprising after Jina Amini's death, which united diverse groups in protests demanding democratic values, met with regime violence and inspiring global solidarity under the slogan "Jin Jiyan Azadi." It urges intersectionality, solidarity, and learning from affected communities to drive transformative change against colonial, capitalist, and patriarchal systems. Three eco-feminist movements are featured: India's Chipko Movement using nonviolent tree-hugging to halt deforestation; Argentina's Ni Una Menos marches against femicides, fostering intersectional solidarity; and the Iranian protests.
