The IPCC's Working Group III Report outlines climate solutions to limit warming to 1.5°C, emphasizing urgent action to halve global emissions by 2030 through solar, wind, forest conservation, efficient agriculture, and energy efficiency—many at low or negative costs. It highlights rising climate litigation as a governance force, the need to triple investments while ending fossil subsidies, and equity in addressing high emitters. No country meets required emission cuts; transformative changes via policy, innovation, and public pressure are essential to phase out fossils and ensure just transitions.
