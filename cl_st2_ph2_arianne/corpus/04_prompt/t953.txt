Greenpeace campaigns against chemical pesticides in agriculture, deeming them unnecessary as ecological pest management succeeds globally. A review of literature reveals grim health impacts: industrial farming's routine pesticide use exposes farmers, families, and the public, linking to cancers, neurodegenerative diseases, immune and hormone disruptions, birth defects, and developmental issues, especially in pregnant women and children. Genetic vulnerabilities and intergenerational effects are noted. Proving causation is challenging due to multiple exposures. The solution is shifting to ecological farming for healthy food and protection; readers are urged to join the food movement.
