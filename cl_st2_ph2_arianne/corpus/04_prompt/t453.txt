The blog post highlights rising global military spending, reaching $1.9 trillion in 2019, a 3.6% increase, with further rises in 2020, including 5.3% in the US and 10% in Germany. It contrasts these costs with healthcare needs, noting a Leopard 2 tank equals 440 ventilators, and global nuclear budgets are ten times the UN and WHO combined. The COVID-19 pandemic exposes misplaced priorities, urging a shift from militarism to funding healthcare, poverty reduction, and environmental protection. It calls for reallocating budgets, supporting a global ceasefire, and using #movethemoney and #Doves4Peace campaigns.
