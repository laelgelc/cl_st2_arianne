In May 2020, over 20,000 tons of diesel spilled from a Norilsk Nickel tank near Norilsk, Russia, polluting the Ambarnaya River and marking the largest oil spill in the polar Arctic. Rosprirodnadzor sued the company, leading to a court order for 146 billion rubles (nearly 2 billion USD) in damages, the highest in Russian history. Greenpeace highlighted the disaster with space images and, with Novaya Gazeta, conducted an expedition revealing oil products spreading toward the Kara Sea despite company restrictions. The text urges phasing out oil for carbon-free energy, a green recovery, and addressing impacts on Indigenous communities and ecosystems.
