The blog post discusses global calls for banks to stop financing harmful tar sands pipelines, such as Dakota Access, Kinder Morgan, Keystone XL, and Line 3, which threaten Indigenous communities, clean water, wildlife, and climate stability without consent. It highlights the Indigenous-led Mazaska Talks Global Days of Action from October 23-25, involving over 50 protests in more than 60 cities across six countries to #DivestTheGlobe. Actions disrupted banks like Chase, Toronto-Dominion, and Credit Suisse. The post urges signing a petition to pressure banks and notes violations of Indigenous rights, including tiny houses built to block construction.
