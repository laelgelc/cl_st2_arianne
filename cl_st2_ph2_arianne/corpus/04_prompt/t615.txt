Greenpeace is embarking on a pole-to-pole expedition aboard the ship Esperanza to expose ocean threats, confront environmental destruction, and champion solutions. Starting in the Arctic, they'll collaborate with scientists to study climate change impacts on marine life, document issues like shrinking sea ice for polar bears, plastic pollution in the Sargasso Sea, illegal fishing in the South Atlantic, and deep-sea mining risks to the Lost City. The voyage highlights diverse ocean ecosystems and wildlife, while supporting the #ProtectTheOceans campaign for a strong Global Ocean Treaty to safeguard a third of the seas by 2030.
