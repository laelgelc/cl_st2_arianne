Captain Mike Fincken, with three decades as a sailor, views the oceans as his home and has witnessed their decline due to overfishing, poor management, and illegal activities in West Africa. He calls for urgent regional fisheries management to promote sustainability and end exploitation. Aboard the Greenpeace ship Esperanza, he and his crew are sailing West African waters for two and a half months to document overfishing's impacts on fish stocks, food security, and local communities. Drawing from past experiences, he recounts chasing pirate vessels, witnessing Chinese fleet infractions, assisting arrests, and observing destructive European "Monster boats."
