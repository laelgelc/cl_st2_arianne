The blog post highlights the escalating plastic pollution crisis, where corporations wrap items like avocados and t-shirts in single-use plastic for convenience, with over 90% of plastics never recycled, leading to ocean debris choking marine life such as turtles, whales, and seabirds. It urges readers to share photos of excessive plastic packaging using #BreakFreeFromPlastic, tag companies, and join over one million people demanding corporate accountability. Global user-submitted photos are featured, motivating action to break free from such packaging in 2018.
