Jeremy Raguain, a Seychellois conservationist, writes an open letter to Western Indian Ocean island leaders, urging action against unsustainable fishing, over-tourism, fossil fuel exploration, and deep seabed mining amid the climate and ecological crisis. He proposes six solutions: ban fish aggregating devices and enforce polluter pays; assess carrying capacities before hotel developments; impose a fossil fuel moratorium; reject deep seabed mining via precautionary measures; expand marine protected areas, including designating Saya de Malha Bank as a UNESCO site; and support a Global Ocean Treaty. He warns of replacement if leaders fail to act.
