Roger Payne (1935-2023) pioneered recordings of humpback whale songs in 1970, releasing the bestselling environmental album that deepened humanity's connection to nature and fueled the global anti-whaling movement, including Greenpeace's efforts. His work inspired activists like Rémi Parmentier, who distributed the record in France to support campaigns aboard the Rainbow Warrior, leading to the 1982 commercial whaling moratorium. Kelly Rigg recalls Payne's testimony aiding efforts to protect North Atlantic right whales from offshore drilling. Payne founded Ocean Alliance and emphasized listening to the earth's voices.
