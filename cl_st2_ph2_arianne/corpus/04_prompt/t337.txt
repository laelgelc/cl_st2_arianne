Greenpeace Switzerland activists projected messages at Nestlé’s headquarters in Vevey before its Annual General Meeting, accusing the company of fueling plastic and climate crises through single-use packaging. They demanded Nestlé reduce throwaway plastics and invest in reusable systems, criticizing its reliance on recycling and alternative materials as greenwashing that harms biodiversity. In 2020, Nestlé sold 1.3 million tonnes of single-use plastic, with less than 1% reusable, and was named a top global polluter. Projections highlighted plastic's petroleum origins and urged a shift from single-use to reuse to combat pollution and global warming.
