The blog post criticizes "Nature Positive" as a vague concept prioritizing a failed economic model over biodiversity protection, allowing net gains through offsetting destruction via restoration elsewhere. It highlights proponents' targets—zero net loss from 2020, net positives by 2030, and full recovery by 2050—but deems them unscientific, lacking credible indicators like carbon storage and habitat extent that fail to capture biodiversity complexity. The agenda promotes nature's financialization and trading, risking greenwashing by industries. Governments should reject it from COP15 agreements, instead advancing conservation policies recognizing Indigenous rights to curb destruction.
