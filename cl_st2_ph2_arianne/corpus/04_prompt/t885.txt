Captain Mike Fincken describes transporting a Steinway baby grand piano aboard the Greenpeace ship Arctic Sunrise from Germany northward, enduring a storm off Norway and crossing the Arctic Circle amid dropping temperatures. In Longyearbyen, composer Ludovico Einaudi joins, and they navigate to Wahlenbergbreen glacier in Yoldiabukta Bay, anchoring near the ice wall. Einaudi performs "Elegy to the Arctic" on a floating stage, his music accompanied by melting ice sounds and collapsing cliffs, evoking deep emotion. He plays for Arctic birds, the crew, 8 million Save The Arctic supporters, future generations, and Fincken's son on his fourth birthday.
