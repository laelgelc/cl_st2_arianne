The blog post discusses the COVID-19 crisis and its links to environmental factors, emphasizing the "dilution effect" where biodiversity reduces disease spread. It highlights how deforestation, mining, and urbanization increase human contact with wildlife and viruses, as noted by expert Kate Jones. Climate change alters infectious disease patterns, with rising temperatures and extreme weather enabling pathogen spread via hosts like mosquitoes. Zoonotic diseases, comprising 75% of emerging ones, rise due to habitat loss.
