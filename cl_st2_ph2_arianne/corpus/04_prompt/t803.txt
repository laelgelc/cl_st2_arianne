The blog post highlights the urgency of climate change amid rising extreme weather, urging action over inaction. It criticizes Samsung Electronics for relying on dirty energy like coal, using only 1% renewables in production despite its massive scale—producing 400 million smartphones in 2016, supplying companies like Apple and Tesla, and earning $10 billion in profit. While rivals like Apple have switched to 100% renewables, Samsung is called to live up to its slogans by choosing renewables. The post, by Greenpeace's Insung Lee, rallies people to pressure Samsung to stop fueling climate change.
