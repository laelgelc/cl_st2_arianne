A Greenpeace blog post highlights vulnerabilities in French and Belgian nuclear plants, likening them to a "Sword of Damocles" due to risks from outside attacks. A report by independent experts, submitted to authorities in France, Belgium, Germany, Switzerland, and Luxembourg, criticizes the poor protection of spent fuel storage pools, which hold large amounts of radioactive material. Unlike reinforced reactor buildings, these pools are inadequately secured against modern threats like those from criminals or isolated individuals post-9/11. If damaged, pools could lose cooling water, releasing massive radioactivity. Greenpeace urges operators EDF and Engie-Electrabel to enhance security, while withholding the full report for sensitivity but providing an executive summary.
