The blog post discusses the rising popularity of tuna as an affordable, nutritious food, boosted by trends like #TinnedFishDateNight, but highlights severe environmental and human costs. It details forced labor on distant-water fishing vessels, including 20-hour workdays, poor nutrition, wage withholding, and passport confiscation, as revealed in Greenpeace investigations and reports like Choppy Waters. Environmentally, it notes overfished tuna stocks, with a third fished unsustainably, high bycatch from longlining and purse seining with FADs harming marine life. It urges consumers to choose sustainable options and pressure governments for ethical fisheries management.
