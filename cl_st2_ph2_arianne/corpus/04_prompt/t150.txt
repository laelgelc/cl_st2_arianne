Luís Ferreirim, Head of Agriculture at Greenpeace Spain, is being sued by Valle de Odieta S.C.L. for criticizing their factory farms, including a massive dairy operation in Caparroso with 7,200 cows and a planned mega farm in Noviercas with 23,520 cows. Factory farms across Europe harm the environment, climate, animals, and small farmers, with EU farm numbers declining while meat production rises. The lawsuit is a SLAPP to silence critics, following similar cases in Spain. Ferreirim refuses to retract, citing the company's violations like animal mistreatment, unauthorized expansions, and a toxic spill in the Aragón River. He urges sharing the story, adopting plant-based diets, and demanding government support for sustainable farming to stop factory farms.
