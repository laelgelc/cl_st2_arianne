Greenpeace activists are protesting BP's oil rig in Scotland's Cromarty Firth amid a climate emergency, criticizing BP's greenwashing and Paris Agreement rhetoric while it pursues new oil extraction. On June 9th, activists boarded the rig, hung a "Climate Emergency" banner, and occupied it for days despite police removals and injunctions. After the rig was towed to the North Sea, the Greenpeace ship Arctic Sunrise pursued it, leading to the rig's unexpected U-turn back to Scotland. Solidarity protests occurred at BP stations, with calls for global support to stop further drilling.
