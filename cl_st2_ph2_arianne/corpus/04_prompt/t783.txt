The blog post discusses the century-long dominance of automobiles, with high vehicle ownership in countries like the UK, USA, and others. It highlights a shift among young people towards bicycles, public transport, and trains due to costs, citing examples: Berlin favors public transport; Copenhagen sees 62% cycling commutes; Lyon has a 20% drop in city-entering cars with growing bike hires; London's car journeys fell 25% since 1990. Car-free days are popular, like Bogota's week-long event. While electric cars are positive, true sustainability requires cycle lanes, diverse transport options, affordable clean mass transit, and reduced car reliance. Greenpeace's report, Freedom to Breathe: Rethinking Urban Transport, envisions this future, noting cars' wastefulness in resources, idling (95% time), and parking space (e.g., 14% in LA County). Cities providing alternatives change travel habits.
