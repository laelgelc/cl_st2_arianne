Indigenous women leaders Elizângela da Silva (Baré) and Janete Alves (Desana), coordinators of FOIRN's Women's Department in São Gabriel da Cachoeira, Brazil, shifted from handicrafts to producing over 16,000 protective masks amid COVID-19. Inspired by TV reports, they recruited artisans, used donated patterns and online tutorials, and distributed masks to 23 Indigenous Peoples in the Rio Negro region. Funded by the "Rio Negro, Nós Cuidamos" project and supported by Greenpeace's Wings of Emergency with sewing machines, they face grief from losses, including elders cremated without rites, yet persist using traditional medicines and determination to save lives.
