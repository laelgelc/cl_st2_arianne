Three young Nigerian women, Angel Chukwudi-Denis, Fortune Mmesomachukwu Somuadina, and Favour Chinecherem Chibuike, known as Eco Elixirs Nigeria, developed the EarthExp app after witnessing floods in Kogi state caused by climate change and plastic waste. The app, a Technovation award winner, uses games, VR, and social features to educate users on environmental trends, promote behavioral change, and encourage actions like tree planting and water conservation for sustainability. It inspires climate action amid Nigeria's deforestation and pollution challenges, aligning with youth-led efforts across Africa to build resilient communities and counter capitalist systems.
