Irving and Dorothy Stowe, pacifists influenced by Gandhi and Quaker ideals, fled the US due to opposition to the Vietnam War and nuclear testing, settling in Vancouver. They organized anti-war and ecological campaigns, forming the Don’t Make A Wave Committee to protest US nuclear tests on Amchitka Island. Inspired by a suggestion to sail into the test zone, they fundraised through concerts and chartered the boat Phyllis Cormack, renamed Greenpeace. Though the 1971 voyage didn't stop the blast, it galvanized global opposition, leading to the program's cancellation and the founding of the Greenpeace Foundation.
