Greenpeace marks a year of campaigning against forest destruction for palm oil, exposing Wilmar's links to rainforest destroyers and sales to global brands. Actions included murals in 20 cities, occupying a Wilmar refinery, intercepting tankers twice, and confronting Mondelez over its ties to dirty palm oil, with protests and blockades at its sites in Italy, Germany, UK, and USA. Over 1.3 million supporters pressured brands, leading Wilmar to publish a plan to map suppliers and halt purchases from destroyers. With under 400 days to 2020 commitments, Greenpeace will monitor implementation to end deforestation.
