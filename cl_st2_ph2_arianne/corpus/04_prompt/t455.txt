The 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster continues to pose risks, with long-lived radionuclides still circulating. Recent wildfires, starting April 3, 2020, are the largest ever in the exclusion zone, burning 57,000 hectares (22% of the area) and releasing radioactive particles like caesium-137, strontium-90, americium-241, and plutonium isotopes into the air. Smoke has reached Kyiv and Norway, increasing radiation levels and health risks such as cancer from inhalation. Fires exacerbate nuclear threats, burden emergency services amid the COVID-19 crisis, and highlight ongoing transparency issues, affecting millions in contaminated areas of Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia.
