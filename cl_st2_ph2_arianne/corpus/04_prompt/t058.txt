Greenpeace activists from climate-hit countries occupied a Shell ship carrying equipment for the Penguins oil and gas field in the North Sea, marking the organization's longest protest on a moving platform. Lasting 13 days from January 31 to February 12, the action highlighted Shell's record $39.9 billion profits amid global climate damage, including floods in Pakistan. Protesters demanded Shell stop drilling and pay for destruction caused, noting the project would emit 45 million tonnes of CO2. Despite a court order and $120,000 damage claim, more activists joined, ending with a banner in Norway.
