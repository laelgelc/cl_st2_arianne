USER PROMPT:
Read the summary below.

TASK:

Write a blog post based ONLY on the summary provided below:
- DO NOT include titles.
- DO NOT invent information.
- DO NOT include analysis unrelated to the summary.

The blog post commemorates the 36th anniversary of the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster, where a safety test at reactor 4 caused an explosion and massive radioactive release, contaminating Ukraine, Europe, and beyond, leading to evacuations, $700 billion in costs, and long-term uninhabitable areas. It criticizes the nuclear industry's promotion as safe and green, including EU taxonomy plans, amid ongoing obfuscation. Parallels are drawn to Russia's 2022 invasion, with seizures of Chernobyl and Zaporizhzhia plants posing catastrophic risks to Ukraine's nuclear facilities.
