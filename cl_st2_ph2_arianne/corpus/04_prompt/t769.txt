Antarctic krill are tiny, alien-like creatures vital to the Antarctic Ocean's food web, serving as prey for penguins, seabirds, seals, fish, and migrating whales like blue and humpback. They exhibit bioluminescence, forming massive swarms of up to 30,000 per cubic meter, and can moult shells to evade predators or shrink to conserve energy. As climate heroes, krill capture carbon and deposit it on the seafloor. However, industrial fishing threatens them for Omega-3 pills and fish food, prompting calls for the world's largest ocean sanctuary to protect the Antarctic.
