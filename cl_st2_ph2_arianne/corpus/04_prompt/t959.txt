3M announced a global sustainable paper buying policy after campaigns by ForestEthics and Greenpeace, aiming to avoid forest destruction. Key elements include prohibiting paper from sources threatening High Conservation Value Forests, Intact Forest Landscapes, or High Carbon Stock areas; requiring Free, Prior and Informed Consent from indigenous communities; ensuring worker rights like no forced or child labor and freedom to unionize; increasing recycled and tree-free paper use while reducing overall consumption; and providing public performance reports with The Forest Trust. 3M cut ties with an RGE subsidiary linked to APRIL's rainforest destruction in Indonesia and warned Resolute Forest Products to comply or lose business, addressing issues like habitat degradation and indigenous conflicts.
