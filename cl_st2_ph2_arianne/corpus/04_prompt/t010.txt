Artist Benjamin Von Wong describes his 2016 art project—a mermaid ensnared in 10,000 plastic bottles—that garnered 35 million views, sparked discussions on disposable culture, and drove policy talks, behavior shifts, and awareness of single-use plastics. Despite progress, plastic production persists. For the Global Plastics Treaty, he built a 4-story faucet installation at the UN, but its message was misconstrued. Now, partnering with Greenpeace, he created a 5-meter perpetual plastic machine illustrating the fossil fuel-plastic lifecycle, urging a strong treaty with a moratorium on virgin plastic production ahead of INC-2.
