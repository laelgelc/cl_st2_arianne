The blog post argues that nuclear power is falsely promoted as a quick, safe, and efficient solution for decarbonizing amid the climate crisis, but it faces high costs ($112–$189 per MWh versus cheaper renewables), long construction times (average 10 years), vulnerability to heatwaves and water stress, and significant CO2 emissions during building and uranium processing. It produces unmanaged radioactive waste, burdens taxpayers with billions in costs, and poses security risks from terrorism, disasters, or war, as seen in Ukraine. New technologies like EPR and fusion are delayed and overbudget. Renewables offer faster, cheaper, scalable alternatives for urgent emissions reductions.
