Thousands worldwide joined Greenpeace's call for Samsung to reuse or recycle 4.3 million Galaxy Note7 phones, with cyberactivists launching a 24-hour tweetstorm using #SaveTheGalaxy, making #GalaxyNote7 trend in Mexico. Supporters from countries like Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Mexico, the US, UK, Germany, Netherlands, Australia, and Colombia called Samsung, receiving mixed responses on disposal plans, from destruction to recycling or no information. Greenpeace Korea protested at Samsung's HQ, urging CEO Kwon Oh-hyun to rethink product design and reuse materials. Over 30,000 signed a petition; calls to action include signing, calling Samsung, and sharing.
