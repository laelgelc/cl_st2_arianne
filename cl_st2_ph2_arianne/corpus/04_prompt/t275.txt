The blog post from Greenpeace's Vital Ocean Voices series profiles 25-year-old Athina Antoine, a Reef Rescuers team member with Nature Seychelles, restoring coral reefs on Cousin Island Special Reserve. It details their daily work: collecting Pocillopora coral fragments, breaking them into nubbins, attaching them to ropes in midwater nurseries, monitoring growth, cleaning biofouling, and transplanting after 9-12 months using the reef gardening method. The post highlights coral bleaching impacts from ocean warming and pollution, reefs' importance for Seychelles' fisheries, tourism, and ecosystem services, and Athina's hope to inspire youth involvement in ocean conservation.
