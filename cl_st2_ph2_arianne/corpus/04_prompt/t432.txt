Parit Chomchuen, a transman and activist at Greenpeace Thailand, shares his experiences during Pride Month, highlighting internal and external pressures faced by transgender people. He describes societal gender norms as a restrictive "box" that prompts questions about masculinity, appearance, hormonal therapy, and surgery, leading to internalized struggles. Breaking free incurs stigma, discrimination, and transphobia, impacting mental health like higher depression rates. Parit urges removing fixed gender beliefs, fostering welcoming environments, and supporting queer rights in organizations. He links his queer activism to Greenpeace's environmental campaigns, emphasizing injustice's universality through the Global Rainbow Network.
