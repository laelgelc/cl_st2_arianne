Greenpeace marked the 30th anniversary of the French government's bombing of the Rainbow Warrior in Auckland, which sank the ship using limpet mines and killed photographer Fernando Pereira. Recently, agent Jean-Luc Kister apologized in interviews, confirming the attack as deliberate violence against protests of French nuclear testing. Greenpeace France's Jean-François Julliard stated the bombing failed to halt the movement's courage. Captain Pete Willcox accepted the apology but criticized France's lack of official remorse, labeling it state-sponsored terrorism and questioning claims of incompetence over indifference.
