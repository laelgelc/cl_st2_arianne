The Great Northern Forest, also known as the boreal forest or Taiga, forms a vast green belt around the Arctic, storing more carbon in its soil than tropical forests to combat climate change. It shelters species like the Siberian Tiger, bears, and salamanders. The forest endures extreme seasonal shifts, with Siberian winters dropping to -35°C and summers reaching 25.5°C. Animals adapt through color changes, antifreeze-like chemicals, and hibernation, while conifers like pine and spruce resist freezing with low-sap needles and sunlight-absorbing shapes. Protecting these ancient trees is crucial; join the effort.
