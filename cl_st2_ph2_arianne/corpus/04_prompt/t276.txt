The blog post describes a Greenpeace campaigner's participation in Amsterdam's largest Pride Walk, marching with Queers4Climate NL, Extinction Rebellion, and Greenpeace to support LGBTQIA+ rights amid the climate crisis. It emphasizes Pride as a protest, not a party, and highlights how climate disasters disproportionately affect LGBTQIA+ communities, increasing homelessness risks and hate, as seen in Fiji where cyclones are blamed on sodomy. Greenpeace fights for a just, diverse society, opposes polluters' greenwashing, and invites LGBTQIA+ climate activists to join, noting the movement's strength in inclusivity.
