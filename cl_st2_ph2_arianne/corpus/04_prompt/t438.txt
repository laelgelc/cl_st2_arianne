Read the summary below.

TASK:

Write a blog post based ONLY on the summary provided below:

The blog post links biodiversity loss to increased infectious disease risks, using COVID-19 as an example of how ecosystem destruction, deforestation, and wildlife trade expose humans to zoonotic threats. It emphasizes that this global issue requires cross-border solutions, advocating for the Convention on Biological Diversity's "protect 30" proposal to safeguard at least 30% of the world's land and oceans by 2030 through sanctuaries. Success depends on respecting indigenous rights, women's empowerment, community engagement, and international support for frontline communities to implement protections.
