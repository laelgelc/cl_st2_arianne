Nasrullah, chairperson of the Forest Fire Community in Tanjung Taruna Village, Central Kalimantan, Indonesia, recounts the 2015 forest fires that forced evacuations and the ongoing efforts to prevent and extinguish fires each dry season. This year, fires escalated from July, leading to a state of emergency in six provinces, with insufficient government responses like water bombs. Greenpeace Indonesia's team and locals have worked tirelessly, but hopes faded as smoke worsened air quality, with AQI exceeding 300 and reaching 2000, affecting neighboring countries. He urges government enforcement of laws against perpetrators and strong peat protection policies to end the disasters.
