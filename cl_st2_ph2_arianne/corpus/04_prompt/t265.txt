During a visit to Brindisi's beaches on the Adriatic coast, the author observed extensive plastic waste, including a 1960s Montecatini bleach bottle that highlights plastic's decades-long persistence in nature. The local petrochemical plant, now owned by ENI's Versalis, produces plastic pellets from oil and gas, contributing to pollution like gas flaring and benzene emissions. Big brands like Coca-Cola and Nestlé drive plastic demand, linking the plastic crisis to the climate emergency and enabling fossil fuel industries. Locals report health concerns and disillusionment with the plant's unfulfilled economic promises. Greenpeace supports affected communities in transitioning to a green economy.
