Over four days in Sierra Leone's waters, Greenpeace and local inspectors uncovered multiple illegal fishing cases aboard the Esperanza. They found a vessel with infractions leading to passport confiscation and fines. Two Chinese boats, Fu Hai Yu 1111 and 2222, hid undersized 51mm nets, had shark carcasses, lacked logbooks, and offloaded without licenses, resulting in orders back to port. An Italian-flagged ship carried 4kg of shark fins, violating EU rules, which Greenpeace will report. A Korean vessel, Cona, obscured its name, had AIS off, poor crew conditions, and 53mm nets below the 60mm legal minimum. The author calls for West African government cooperation to manage oceans.
