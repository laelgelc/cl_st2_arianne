Despite COVID-19 halting much of the world in 2020, Greenpeace activists documented global warming impacts from remote areas, with admirable commitment from ship crews, volunteers, and scientists. Highlighted images from ships Rainbow Warrior, Arctic Sunrise, and Esperanza include: Antarctic petrels near krill fishing; teen activist Mya-Rose Craig's northernmost climate strike in the Arctic; protests against Shell's North Sea oil platform; a flotilla and 62-hour blockade leading to Preem withdrawing its Swedish refinery expansion; demands for Denmark's oil/gas ban and wind power expansion; sea protection projections in Germany; and activists with Jason Momoa's "Aquaman" trident preparing to occupy a Danish oil rig.
