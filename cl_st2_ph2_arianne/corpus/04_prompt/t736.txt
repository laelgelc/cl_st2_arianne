European cities are addressing air pollution and emissions by promoting public transport, cycling, and walking over cars. Oslo is enhancing cycling infrastructure with car-free zones and converting car parks to bike lanes. Amsterdam, with more bikes than people, redesigned streets after 1970s protests against traffic fatalities but still exceeds EU air pollution limits. Copenhagen leads with popular bike lanes and strong walking encouragement, though public transport ranks mid-range. Vienna offers affordable public transport, while Zurich has high usage but needs better cyclist and pedestrian safety. A Greenpeace report ranks 13 cities, highlighting leaders and laggards, with poorer performers facing EU legal action.
