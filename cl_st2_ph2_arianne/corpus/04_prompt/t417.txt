Greenpeace partnered with Brazilian actress Alice Braga to launch the animated series "Countdown to Destruction," highlighting how industrial production of meat, dairy, soy, and palm oil drives global deforestation, displaces Indigenous Peoples, and exacerbates the climate crisis. The post urges turning the crisis into an opportunity for equality and justice by amplifying Indigenous voices. It critiques the pandemic's "nature healing" narrative, emphasizing systemic issues like infinite economic growth clashing with ecosystems, centered on the Amazon. The Amazon links global food chains, and while individual choices matter, brands and governments must reform unjust systems. Protecting the Amazon is essential for solving climate challenges and building a just society.
