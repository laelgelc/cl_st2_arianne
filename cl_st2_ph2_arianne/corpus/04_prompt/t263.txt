The blog post highlights mobility challenges in cities dominated by cars, which harm the climate and urban life, as noted by Greenpeace's criticism of manufacturers like Volkswagen. It features stories from six women: mothers facing unsafe sidewalks and lack of open spaces for children; disabled individuals dealing with inaccessible parking and obstacles; and those reliant on public transport or biking, enduring long waits, safety risks, and poor infrastructure. The post advocates for ambitious policies, better public transport, green spaces, and universal accessibility to improve life for all, especially vulnerable groups. It promotes the #MobilityForAll campaign during European Mobility Week 2021 for radical city transformations.
