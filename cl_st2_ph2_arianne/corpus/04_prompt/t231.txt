Illegal mining in the Amazon threatens local communities' health and livelihoods, with rumors of gold in the Madeira River drawing hundreds of rafts near Autazes. Greenpeace Brazil documented the activity on November 23, noting miners' support from businessmen and politicians in places like Humaitá. Mercury contamination from mining pollutes rivers. Despite awareness, Ibama and Ipaam face resource cuts under Bolsonaro. Pressure led to a November 28 operation destroying 70 rafts and arresting 10 miners, though a public announcement by Vice-President Mourão allowed escapes. MapBiomas data shows mining areas sextupled from 1985-2020, mostly in the Amazon, surging in Indigenous lands and conservation units. The government lacks will to protect the forest amid climate crisis.
