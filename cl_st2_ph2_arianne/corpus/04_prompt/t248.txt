USER PROMPT:
Read the summary below.

TASK:

Write a blog post based ONLY on the summary provided below:
- DO NOT include titles.
- DO NOT invent information.
- DO NOT include analysis unrelated to the summary.

The blog post profiles Chief Puraka and the Apurinã people in Caititu Indigenous Land, who value living in harmony with nature amid threats from deforestation for agribusiness, which consumes 70% of global freshwater and exacerbates water crises and extreme weather. It criticizes destruction-based economics that harms low-income communities and highlights low HDI in deforested areas like Pará. Pending bills risk legalizing land invasions and undermining indigenous rights. Alternatives include socio-biodiversity chains like managed fishing and nuts, agroforestry systems reviving traditions, and family farming for inclusive production. Broader impacts include continental droughts from reduced Amazon evaporation.
