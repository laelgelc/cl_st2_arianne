The blog post highlights that two-thirds of oceans are international waters lacking strong protection, prioritizing exploitation over conservation. It focuses on the Central Arctic Ocean, warming twice as fast as the global average, with sea ice melting rapidly and potential ice-free summers by 2030, revealing a new ocean teeming with vulnerable marine life. Greenpeace advocates for a sanctuary banning extractive activities like fishing, mining, and oil drilling, enabled by a proposed UN treaty. The organization monitored recent UN discussions to ensure robust ocean protection, urging action to create a lasting protected legacy. The UN chair aims for agreement by 2019.
