The blog post discusses the severe air pollution in Wentworth, South Durban Basin, caused by refineries like Engen and SAPREF, leading to high rates of asthma, cancer, and leukemia in children, as revealed by University of KwaZulu-Natal research. Pollution induces epigenetic changes, increasing disease susceptibility across generations. Residents, including Shareeza Domingo's family, face chronic health issues, poverty, unemployment, and social problems like violence.
