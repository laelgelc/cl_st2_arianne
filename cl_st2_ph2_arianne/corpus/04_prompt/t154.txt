The blog post criticizes fossil gas as a climate killer, major source of Europe's greenhouse gas emissions via methane, and a fuel for Russia's war in Ukraine, with EU states paying billions for Russian imports without an embargo. It highlights gas's role in energy poverty, health hazards from appliances causing respiratory issues and accidents, and an example of a sunken rig leaking methane. Despite this, the EU's RePowerEU plan substitutes Russian gas with other sources and proposes labeling it 'green' for investments. The post urges phasing out gas by 2035 using renewables, efficiency, and insulation for true energy security.
