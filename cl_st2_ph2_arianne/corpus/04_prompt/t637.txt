The blog post discusses severe threats to seabirds, especially albatrosses, from human activities like industrial overfishing, which depletes prey fish and causes population declines of up to 70% since 1950. Additional dangers include bycatch in fishing gear, plastic pollution killing over a million birds yearly, invasive species, historical feather harvesting, collisions, oil spills, toxic chemicals, and ocean acidification from CO2 emissions, increasing acidity by 30% since the Industrial Revolution and harming marine life like corals and shellfish. Studies highlight ecosystem disruptions, with calls for expanded marine reserves, trawling bans, and restoration efforts to aid recovery.
