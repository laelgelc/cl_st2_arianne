It introduces "vitae" for interconnected living entities and "symmathesy" for systems of mutual learning, rejecting mechanistic views. Bateson's Warm Data Labs facilitate trans-contextual discussions on issues like carbon emissions, fostering insights into multifaceted challenges without binary positions.
