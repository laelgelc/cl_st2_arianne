The blog post highlights how Europe's fossil fuel-dependent transport system exacerbates multiple crises, including climate change, inflation, energy price hikes, and wars funded by oil exports like Russia's. It notes transport's high costs for households, its role in 30% of EU greenhouse gas emissions, and environmental damage from oil extraction and false solutions like agrofuels. The post advocates draining oil from mobility by shifting to affordable public and active transport, decarbonizing by 2040, avoiding inefficient alternatives, and ensuring a fair transition through ending polluter subsidies and supporting workers.
