Last weekend, 35,000 people gathered in Lützerath, Germany, to defend the village from demolition for RWE's Garzweiler coal mine expansion, which sits atop 280 million tons of lignite and threatens Germany's Paris Agreement carbon budget despite no energy need. Activists, occupied for over two years, faced violent eviction by police. The protest symbolizes global resistance against fossil fuel crimes, including similar fights in East Africa, Argentina, India, and North America. Greenpeace supports these communities, calling for accountability as 100 companies cause 70% of emissions, prioritizing profits amid government complicity.
