In 2022, the world faced ongoing challenges as normalcy shifted, with nature unleashing record heat waves across Europe, Africa, America, and China, leading to wildfires, droughts, deaths, and dried-up lakes and rivers. Pakistan suffered its worst flooding, submerging one-third of the country and impacting 33 million people. Amid this Climate Emergency, urgent and courageous action is needed to save the planet for future generations.
