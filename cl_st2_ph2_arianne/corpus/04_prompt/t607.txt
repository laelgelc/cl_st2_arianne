The blog discusses the UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues addressing indigenous rights to free, prior, and informed consent, often ignored by the oil industry. It highlights Numto village in Western Siberia, where Khanty and Nenets reindeer herders face environmental threats from Surgutneftegas oil drilling, including land destruction, potential spills, and isolation.
