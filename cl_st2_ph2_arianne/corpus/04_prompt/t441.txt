The blog post applies Gregory Bateson's "double bind" concept to the coronavirus pandemic, highlighting dilemmas like balancing economic collapse against health risks and unchecked growth driving ecological crises such as species loss and global heating. It argues that solutions require expanding awareness to Earth's biosphere, embracing an Ecological Imperative to reduce human population and consumption to avoid overshoot. Critiquing "sustainable growth" and technology fixes, it advocates learning from nature's resilience, localization, and mutual reciprocity, urging a post-pandemic shift toward respecting ecological limits without rigid plans.
