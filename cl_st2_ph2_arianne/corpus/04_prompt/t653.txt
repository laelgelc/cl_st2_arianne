The Great Southern Reef spans 8,100 km across Australia's southern waters, forming a productive ecosystem with seaweed forests that capture carbon and support hundreds of unique species, 85% endemic, attracting Antarctic whales. Often unexplored due to harsh conditions, Greenpeace's Rainbow Warrior surveys, including first-time dives off Kangaroo Island, follow a study identifying 400 new marine species in the Great Australian Bight. Oil drilling risks spills devastating marine life, industries, and communities. Burning more oil exacerbates climate change amid renewable alternatives; the industry is outdated. Spread the word to urge Australian Government protection.
