The blog post fact-checks misinformation blaming Australia's unprecedented bushfires on arson or green policies rather than climate change. It clarifies that fires resulted from the hottest, driest year on record, with causes like dry lightning and accidents, not widespread arson (only about 1% deliberate). A coordinated disinformation campaign via bots spread false narratives. It debunks claims that environmentalists opposed fire controls and notes city-dwellers' suffering from toxic haze. The post urges discussing climate change now, criticizing politicians' inaction and Australia's coal exports.
