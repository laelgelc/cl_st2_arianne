The blog post highlights how women disproportionately suffer from economic instability amid the current energy crisis, often excluded from decision-making despite their key role in household energy use. Women are more environmentally friendly, supportive of renewables, and linked to better environmental outcomes in leadership. However, they hold only 26.8% of EU environment ministers and 12% of energy sector leadership roles. Energy poverty, affecting women globally through health risks like toxic smoke exposure and excess winter deaths, exacerbates gender inequality. Access to affordable clean energy is deemed a human right for a just transition, urging gender-sensitive policies.
