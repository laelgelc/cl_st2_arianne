Governments have agreed to protect a vast Arctic Ocean area, roughly the size of the Mediterranean Sea, from commercial fishing for at least 16 years, thanks to the Save the Arctic campaign. This bolsters efforts for long-term safeguards against destructive fishing and fossil fuels. Meanwhile, the Antarctic’s Ross Sea sanctuary, twice Spain's size, takes effect today, shielding it from extractive industries. These wins benefit polar wildlife and global oceans, demonstrating people power's impact. Drawing from 1980s Antarctic protections, the post urges creating a massive Antarctic Ocean Sanctuary to safeguard penguins, whales, seals, and krill from industrial fishing.
