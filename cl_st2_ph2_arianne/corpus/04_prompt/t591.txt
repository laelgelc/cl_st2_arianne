The blog post celebrates the 5th Global Sharing Week from June 16th to 21st as a major event promoting sharing to build a new system beyond endless consumption and growth, which harms the planet through climate crises like heatwaves and floods. It notes that 70% of global emissions stem from urban consumption, and sharing—through activities like fixing, making, mending, and community events—reduces emissions, conserves resources, and fosters innovation and collectivity. Sharing Week reaches over 100 million people annually, while MAKE SMTHNG 2018 spanned 48 countries. It urges uniting climate activists with makers and sharers for bottom-up change, encouraging participation in local events.
