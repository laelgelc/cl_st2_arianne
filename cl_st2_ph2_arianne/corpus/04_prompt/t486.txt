Greenpeace, alongside scientists, proposes a rescue plan for oceans: establishing a global network of sanctuaries covering at least 30% by 2030, banning fishing, mining, and drilling in key areas selected using data on habitats, species, and climate impacts. Unlike ineffective "paper parks," these would feature strict rules and enforcement via a new UN body under a Global Ocean Treaty. Public support is needed to counter industry opposition and secure a strong treaty. Oceans provide oxygen, food, and climate protection, and sanctuaries would enhance marine life abundance and resilience to threats like climate change and pollution.
