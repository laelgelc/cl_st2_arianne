In Manaus, Brazil, Parque das Tribos, founded in 2014, is an urban Indigenous neighborhood housing 750 families from over 30 ethnic groups, facing poverty, racism, and infrastructure lacks. Amid COVID-19's hunger crisis, community initiatives like Renata Peixe-Boi's Boca da Mata communal kitchen provide fresh, culturally symbolic meals, empower migrant women, and reconnect youth with Indigenous languages and traditions. Claudia Baré's planned school affirms identities, combats prejudice, and protects children from crime. These efforts promote inclusion, justice, and collective well-being over profit, inspiring alternative futures.
