Amrekha Sharma reflects on the IPCC WGII report's emphasis on justice in climate action, highlighting its validation of frontline communities' experiences and Indigenous knowledge. The report addresses vulnerabilities from inequities like colonialism, intersectionality in impacts on marginalized groups, and the need for human rights-based approaches to adaptation. It supports climate litigation by centering diverse knowledge, historical contexts, and demands for accountability from governments and companies, urging swift action to replace denial with justice-focused responses.
