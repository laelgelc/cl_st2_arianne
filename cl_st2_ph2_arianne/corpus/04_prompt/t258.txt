The world has warmed 1.2°C since pre-industrial times, yet governments and companies make empty promises amid the climate crisis. Urgent action is needed to end reliance on fossil fuels and animal products, and to halt deforestation that threatens biodiversity, Indigenous Peoples, and global climate. Forests are vital for carbon storage, but destruction for industrial agriculture reduces this capacity and adds emissions. A Carbon Brief analysis, including deforestation, ranks Brazil as the fourth biggest polluter. Under Bolsonaro, Amazon deforestation has surged, potentially making it a net carbon emitter. Animal production contributes 19% of global greenhouse gases, with nearly half from methane.
