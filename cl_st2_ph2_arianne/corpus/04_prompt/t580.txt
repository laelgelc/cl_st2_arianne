Greenpeace announced the recent passing of Dr. Roger Grace, a renowned underwater photographer who collaborated extensively with the organization, in New Zealand. In 1990, he joined the Rainbow Warrior II's inaugural campaign against drift netters in the Tasman Sea. Over the years, he participated in expeditions to Antarctica, the Pacific tuna campaign, and numerous others. As a classical photographer, he created iconic underwater images using minimal equipment, reflecting his deep love for marine life and dedication to its protection.
