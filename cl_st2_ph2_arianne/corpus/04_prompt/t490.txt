For cars, it criticizes petrol and diesel emissions of CO2 and NO2, advocating car-free urban options like public transport and cycling, plus electric vehicles powered by renewables, made smaller, and shared. It emphasizes community action, citing examples from China, Belgium, and Turkey where mobilization led to changes like electrified buses, car bans, and coal plant closures, calling for collective solutions.
