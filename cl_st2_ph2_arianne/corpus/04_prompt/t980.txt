Greenpeace celebrates G-Star's commitment to eliminate hazardous chemicals from its supply chain and products by 2020, making it the 15th global corporation to join the Detox movement alongside Uniqlo, Benetton, and Victoria’s Secret. This improves on G-Star's previous half-hearted pledge, including concrete elimination dates, transparency, and upcoming case studies on substituting toxic substances. The fashion industry has long polluted waterways with hazardous chemicals, with some brands offering loophole-filled greenwashing commitments. Public pressure has turned G-Star and Levi’s from greenwashers to Detox leaders. Greenpeace urges sharing the "Detox Fashion" video to demand more action from brands like GAP and Calvin Klein.
