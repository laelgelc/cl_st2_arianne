Emma Thompson recounts her frightening encounter with an orangutan in a Kalimantan sanctuary, highlighting how deforestation for palm oil plantations has destroyed habitats, killing 100,000 orangutans in 16 years through shootings, starvation, bulldozing, and fires. This also endangers Sumatran tigers, rhinos, elephants, and causes human suffering via land conflicts and rights abuses. Brands like Unilever, Nestlé, and Mondelez promised no-deforestation policies by 2020 but still buy "dirty" palm oil, relying on the ineffective RSPO. Greenpeace's campaign, including Thompson's narrated film, urges brands to reject deforesting suppliers to save forests and orangutans.
