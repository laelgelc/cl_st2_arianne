Climate justice and social justice are interconnected, essential for an equitable, sustainable future. Climate change exacerbates inequalities, disproportionately harming vulnerable communities—like low-income countries, people of color, Indigenous Peoples, women, and those with disabilities—who contributed least but face disasters, resource scarcity, and high loss and damage costs (290-580 billion USD annually by 2030). Fossil fuels drive over 75% of GHG emissions, requiring a just phase-out and shift from extractive economies to people-centered models. Polluters must be held accountable. In MENA, warming, droughts, and floods worsen social injustices, threatening ecosystems, livelihoods, and heritage, as documented by Greenpeace.
