The 67th International Whaling Commission (IWC) meeting concluded in Florianopolis, Brazil, amid ongoing polarization between countries. Greenpeace and other groups observed as the Florianopolis Declaration was adopted, affirming whales' ecosystem role and the IWC's conservation focus, amid rising threats like climate change and pollution. Japan's proposal to undermine the 30-year commercial whaling ban was rejected. A proposed South Atlantic Whale Sanctuary failed due to insufficient super-majority support, despite majority backing. The IWC's conservation role was reaffirmed, emphasizing the need for ocean protection momentum.
