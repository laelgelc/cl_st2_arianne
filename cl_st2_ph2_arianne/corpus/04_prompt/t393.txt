The blog post highlights the International Day of Awareness of Food Loss and Waste, noting that over 30% of global food is wasted amid rising hunger, with 690 million people hungry in 2019, exacerbated by COVID-19 through labor shortages, restricted access, and economic fragility. It links waste to environmental harms like deforestation, water use, and 8% of global emissions, critiquing the industrial food system's long supply chains and low prices. Solutions include individual actions like meal planning and buying local, plus systemic changes such as relocalizing production, fair pricing, and ecological farming. It calls for transforming the food system via the 2021 UN Food System Summit for food justice and sovereignty.
