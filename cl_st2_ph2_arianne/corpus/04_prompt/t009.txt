The "Citizen Climate" series highlights global citizens acting for a healthier planet. Kenyan photojournalist and activist James Wakibia discusses activism challenges like funding shortages, reliance on personal finances, and failed grant applications, leading to scaled-down efforts. He calls for supporting climate-impacted communities in Kenya, such as those affected by floods at Lake Nakuru, job losses, and droughts, through adaptation like climate-smart agriculture and increased public awareness. Wakibia advocates against plastic pollution in rivers, educating his 24,000 Twitter followers, pushing for single-use plastic bans, and supporting a strong Global Plastics Treaty in Paris to reduce fossil fuel-based production and achieve a plastic-free future. He emphasizes raising awareness for policy change and youth's role in mobilizing with energy, creativity, and technology.
