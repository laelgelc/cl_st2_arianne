Europe is facing catastrophic wildfires from the Mediterranean to the Arctic, including the Great Northern Forest spanning Sweden to the Russian Far East. Climate change triggers these fires through extreme weather like heatwaves, while fires exacerbate climate change by destroying vital forests and emitting up to 25% of annual CO2, plus black carbon affecting the Arctic. In Russia, 12.6 million hectares have burned, with 2.9 million still active; Sweden sees record fires in up to 60 locations. Most fires are human-caused, urging caution and inclusion of emissions in the Paris Agreement. Donate to support volunteers at www.greatnorthernforest.org.
