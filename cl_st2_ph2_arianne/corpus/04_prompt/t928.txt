Forests absorb CO2 and release oxygen but face alarming deforestation, with 14.5 million hectares lost yearly from 1990-2005, equivalent to one football pitch every two seconds, plus degradation and fragmentation. China's apathy hinders anti-illegal timber efforts despite EU cooperation since 2009. The EU must fully implement FLEGT measures, influence China, and address imports like palm oil and soy driving 80% of deforestation via agriculture. Recognizing the issue in 2013, the Commission is considering new policies for zero-deforestation supply chains by 2020, supporting governance, indigenous rights, and funding for forest protection. Concerns include incomplete enforcement in countries like Spain and risks of premature FLEGT approvals.
