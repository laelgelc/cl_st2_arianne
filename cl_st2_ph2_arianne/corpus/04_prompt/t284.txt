In the Vital Ocean Voices series, 7-year-old Kylian from Mauritius shares his story of cutting his cherished long hair to help combat the Wakashio oil spill. Influenced by his family's fishing and conservation background, he visited Ile Aux Aigrettes nature reserve and learned about the interconnectedness of wildlife, ocean, and local livelihoods. When the ship ran aground, spilling 1,000 tonnes of oil and harming marine life, Kylian donated his hair for oil-absorbing barriers, created a motivational YouTube video, joined a protest, and wrote a story to inspire others—especially children—to protect the oceans.
