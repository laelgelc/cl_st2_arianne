Greenpeace celebrates the victory of activists, petitioners, and global supporters who forced Shell to abandon Arctic drilling plans through protests, petitions, and public pressure, turning a corporate story into headlines and demonstrating people power over profits. Shell cited high costs—over $7 billion spent—insufficient oil finds, a challenging regulatory environment from worldwide opposition, and risks like a 75% chance of oil spills. Environmental threats include accelerating Arctic melting, displacing communities, and harming wildlife. The fight continues for permanent Arctic protection against all oil companies.
