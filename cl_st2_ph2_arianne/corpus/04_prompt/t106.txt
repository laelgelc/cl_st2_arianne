The community in Cayar, Senegal, led by the Taxawu Cayar Collective, has filed a lawsuit against the TPM fishmeal factory for polluting local water with toxic waste, threatening jobs, food access, and health. Evidence presented in court on October 6, 2022, included lab results showing toxic metals and videos of illegal dumping. A November 2022 ruling dismissed a temporary shutdown, but the fight continues. By January 2023, the municipality banned wastewater discharge, prompting further litigation. The industry processes over 500,000 tonnes of fish annually, exacerbating food insecurity, as highlighted by local leaders and Greenpeace Africa.
