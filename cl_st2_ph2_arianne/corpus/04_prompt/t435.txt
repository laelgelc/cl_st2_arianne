Wichotsak Ronarongpairee, chairman of the Thai Sea Watch Association (TSWA), observed COVID-19's impact on southern Thailand's small-scale fishers, including closed markets, dropped seafood prices, and lost income. He launched a fund where 150 THB donations bought local seafood for distribution to communities like the blind and medical staff. It raised nearly 60,000 THB, delivering a ton of fish to over 500 care workers, who expressed gratitude. Ronarongpairee anticipates growth in direct online sales from fishers to consumers for fresh, traditionally caught seafood. TSWA plans another program to aid the poor, homeless, and disabled.
