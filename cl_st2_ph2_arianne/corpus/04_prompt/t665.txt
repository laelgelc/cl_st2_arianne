2018 is declared the climate year amid fires, soaring temperatures, hurricanes, and IPCC confirmation of a changing world worsening ahead. The Climate Vulnerable Forum’s Virtual Summit, hosted by the Marshall Islands, showcases leadership from vulnerable developing countries, including the Marshalls' plan for 100% renewables and net-zero emissions by 2050.
