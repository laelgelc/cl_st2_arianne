In São Gabriel da Cachoeira, Brazil's most Indigenous city, the Coping with COVID-19 Committee—formed by city hall, Indigenous organizations like FOIRN, FUNAI, ISA, DSEI, and the Army—implemented preventive measures including communication in local languages, sanitary barriers, lockdown, and mandatory masks to combat the pandemic. Despite challenges like healthcare collapse and high mortality among vulnerable Indigenous peoples, Greenpeace and partners delivered tests, oxygen, PPE, food, and equipment, while setting up 12 field hospitals (UAPI) in the Rio Negro region for community-based treatment, aiding recoveries and preserving elders' knowledge amid minimal federal support.
