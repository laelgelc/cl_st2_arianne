The blog post criticizes single-use plastic packaging from holiday gifts, noting that only 9% of plastics are recycled, with a truckload entering oceans every minute, harming marine life and entering food chains. It blames corporations for promoting a culture of convenience and mass consumption, shifting responsibility to consumers. In 2018, consumer pressure prompted companies like Kroger, McDonald's, and Starbucks to reduce plastics, starting with straws, but more action is needed. It calls for 2019 resolutions to eliminate personal use and demand corporate and political leaders phase out throwaway plastics entirely, addressing environmental, health, and justice impacts.
