Jennifer Morgan, Greenpeace International's Executive Director, visited Svalbard to observe rapid Arctic changes from climate change, including melting ice and warming temperatures. She highlights industrial fishing's role in polluting shores with trash, mostly from fisheries, harming wildlife like reindeer, polar bears, and seabirds through entanglement and ingestion. A beach clean-up under the ‘Protect What You Love’ campaign raised awareness of destructive bottom trawling. She notes a voluntary industry agreement, brokered by Greenpeace, to avoid expanding cod fishing into untouched northern Barents Sea areas, but urges Norway to establish legal marine protections.
