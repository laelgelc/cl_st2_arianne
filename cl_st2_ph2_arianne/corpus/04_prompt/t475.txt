A Greenpeace East Asia report exposes links between Taiwanese seafood giant Fong Chun Formosa (FCF), a top tuna trader with $45 billion annual revenue, and forced labor on migrant workers, illegal fishing, shark finning, and transshipment at sea. Taiwan's two-tiered system excludes vulnerable Southeast Asian fishers from labor protections, enabling exploitation. The post urges Taiwan to abolish this system, adopt ILO conventions, enhance inspections, and create grievance mechanisms. It calls on FCF to disclose suppliers, end transshipment, ensure monitoring, and upgrade human rights policies. Consumers should reduce seafood intake and support local fisheries to combat industry abuses.
