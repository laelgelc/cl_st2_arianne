The blog post celebrates the past success of eight million people forcing Shell to abandon Arctic oil plans through collective action. It urges readers to support protecting 226,150 km² of international Arctic waters—10% of the Arctic—via the OSPAR commission, with a decision imminent in 18 days at a meeting starting June 20 in Tenerife, Spain. Climate change is exposing this least-protected ocean to threats from oil and fishing. Denmark, Norway, and Iceland are blocking the process despite OSPAR's authority. The post calls for voices to demand protection, emphasizing the Arctic's global impact, and invites reasons for safeguarding it.
