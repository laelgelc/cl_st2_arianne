The blog post discusses Greenpeace Argentina's ongoing campaign against offshore oil development in the Argentine Sea, highlighting overlaps with protected species' habitats like the Southern Right Whale. Despite a precautionary measure suspending activities, a recent government resolution approved Equinor's Environmental Impact Assessment, violating the Escazú Agreement on environmental rights and participation. Greenpeace has submitted a letter demanding annulment and continues protests, including #Atlanticazo demonstrations. It criticizes Equinor's history of oil spills and leaks in Norway and Brazil, warning of ecological and economic disasters from seismic explorations and potential spills.
