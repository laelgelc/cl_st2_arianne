If you follow artists and illustrators on Instagram, it is likely you’ve come across the #DrawThisInYourStyle challenge, where artists recreate others illustrations in their own unique style.

Their creations show the beauty and strangeness of the Lost City. Strange animals with character and beautiful colours and formations usually hidden under the dark ocean depths.

Quentin also depicts the looming threat of the deep sea mining industry. A drill cracking open the earth without a creature in sight.
Other artists also took up the challenge. Either choosing to showcase the beauty and the threat or focusing in on the magical place of the Lost City to inspire its protection. Take a look…

Now the hashtag is being used to help bring to life a small, unique and unknown part of the ocean which is at risk from the mining industry.

In the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, over 750 metres below the water, sits a place called the Lost City. Discovered just 20 years ago, it’s called the Lost City because the giant chimney shaped hydrothermal vents make it look like an abandoned metropolis.

Its discovery has opened up a new chapter for science, challenging what people thought about life on Earth. Some are even asking if it holds the key to where life started .

But, the discovery of the unique ecosystems has attracted the interest of mining industries.

The areas around the big venting chimneys also contain rare earth minerals. The deep seabed mining industry wants to scoop, dredge, and destroy places like the Lost City with gigantic machines that look like something straight out of a sci-fi horror film.
All of the beauty the Lost City holds could be irreversibly damaged – before anyone even fully understands what is there.
Art has always been able to show the beauty and wonder of far away places. That’s why we put the call out to artists across the globe to help bring the Lost City and all its wonders to people everywhere.
The incredible Quentin Blake ( yes, the one who illustrated all those books written by legendary author Roald Dahl) and Charlie Adlard (best known for his work on The Walking Dead comic books) kicked off the challenge.
