Greenpeace’s Ocean Ambassadors are leading the call to Protect the Oceans . They are a group of artists, actors, scientists, explorers and more who recognise the responsibility we all have to protect Earth’s most fragile places.
These Ocean Ambassadors are calling for a strong Global Ocean Treaty, and a huge network of new ocean sanctuaries around the world. These sanctuaries would form a safe haven for whales, turtles, dolphins and other sea life to recover from the pressures of climate change, pollution and overfishing.
Healthy oceans also help to cycle carbon so we can avoid the worst effects of climate change, and provide food security for billions of people. Wherever we are in the world, what happens to the oceans affects us all.
