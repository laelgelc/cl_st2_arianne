Twitter has been our go-to online place to express our climate voices, frustrations, and hopes about protecting our planet. However, with around 450 million monthly active users and 200 billion tweets posted this year, it’s easy to get lost in its timeline and to stay on top of the news. We’ve also had to keep an eye out for climate disinformation as the number of tweets mentioning the “climate scam” has reportedly surged .
Even so, there have been some Twitter gems. Here are some of our favourite climate tweets of 2022.
Overwhelmed by the never-ending news of extreme weather events every time you scroll through your social media timeline? Feeling unheard when you try to advocate for the climate to the people around you or deeply struggling to keep the optimism alive while having your own anxiety about what’s next? Remember this, you are not alone. We are all in this together.
Dead planet? A ticking bomb? Sounds scary indeed, but these tweets are some bold reminders of why we should not give up fighting for our planet and why global leaders should not delay concrete actions. It’s also important to acknowledge that vulnerable nations like Pakistan, Bangladesh, and countries in Africa, which contribute the least to global carbon emissions, are already on the frontline of the climate crisis.
Our planet is worth much more than fossil fuel profits. End of story.
Imagine a little banter with the generations who could have done better for our planet. Yes, “thanks” to them.
It’s not easy to be the voice of reason in the midst of climate denialism flooding Twitter. We are thankful for climate experts who share climate news for us to stay informed and encourage us to speak up.
After all, hope is what we need. Hope encourages us to keep doing better for our planet.
