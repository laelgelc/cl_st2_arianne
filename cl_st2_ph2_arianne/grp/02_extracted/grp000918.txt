The message is clear and unified: People around the world are holding the oil industry accountable for the global climate crisis. From the Philippines to Greece , from Russia to Brazil and from Canada to New Zealand , activists placed posters and street art in highly visible public spaces on 31 July to proclaim that climate anxiety , climate breakdown , and climate grief are all “ proudly brought to you ” by the fossil fuel industry.
The peaceful international display of People vs. Oil solidarity featured a series of posters depicting the types of harmful impacts — more severe forest fires , hurricanes and cyclones predicted to become more intense, as well as more intense rainfall and extreme temperatures becoming more frequent — the oil industry-fueled climate crisis is having in our communities. These bold images were placed in public spaces in 25 cities around the world to push back against the misleading messages that oil companies attempt to foster through their own advertisements.
Here are more images around the world announcing the end of the oil age:
