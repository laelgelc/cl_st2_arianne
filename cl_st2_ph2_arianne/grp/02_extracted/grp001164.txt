While some politicians – ahem, Trump! – are trying to prop up the fossil fuel industry, there’s been a quiet revolution happening around the world.
It’s time we end the age of fossil fuels and help workers and communities transition over to renewables.

People are ditching coal – the main global energy source since 2003 – like never before!
Burning coal is the biggest single source of carbon dioxide emissions from human activity, and mining it also releases the potent greenhouse gas methane.
So why is King Coal no longer the energy of the future? New research from Greenpeace and CoalSwarm shows why.
23 countries, states and cities will have either phased out coal-fired power plants or set a timeline to do so by 2030. Before 2014, no major jurisdiction had completely phased out coal. How things have changed!
Three of the G7 economies have decided to phase out coal – with Italy looking like it might also be phasing coal out soon.
This represents nearly 370 large coal-fired power plants shut down or not built in the first place – enough to power around six United Kingdoms, and equivalent to nearly half a trillion US dollars in assets retired or not developed.
And that’s despite Trump’s pro-coal agenda.
From the UK’s Kingsnorth protests , the Beyond Coal movement in the USA, to artists in Beijing to clean air activists in Delhi , people around the world are protesting dirty, polluting coal in favour of clean, renewable, affordable energy.
