As the only country in the world to have experienced the devastation of nuclear weapons in war, Japan has already witnessed the inhumane consequences of such weapons in Hiroshima and Nagasaki 80 years ago. And as a nation that has personally experienced the horrors of war and nuclear weapons, Japan has a responsibility to firmly oppose any act of war and to clearly demonstrate its commitment to achieving peace."}

In 1991, during the Gulf War, Greenpeace, in cooperation with other organizations, investigated the environmental pollution caused by oil intentionally released into the Persian Gulf by the Iraqi military, and found that the oil had caused serious damage to the marine ecosystem. We are convinced that protecting the environment goes hand in hand with protecting peace for all."}

The use of nuclear weapons, which carry the risk of exposure to radiation and radioactive contamination, seriously affects the environment and people\u2019s lives and health. That is why it is essential to aim for a world free from war and nuclear weapons."}

The Consumer Goods Forum (CGF)\u2019s Plastic Waste Coalition of Action and Reposit \u2013 a leader in reuse and returnable packaging platforms, have completed the first phase, with support from various levels of government. This type of collaborative reuse initiative has the potential to be precedent-setting, with real possibility for scaling and replication across other product categories and sectors. And it also can offer learnings to be applied to how government and industry can improve uptake and accessibility of zero waste, reuse and plastic-free solutions as we globally chart a new course. But once again, piecemeal national and regional regulations and limited collaboration to date means these projects face unnecessary barriers to success. A Treaty can and must change that, and businesses offering examples of new systems in real time is important to guide thinking as governments come to the table."}
