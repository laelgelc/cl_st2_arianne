As we approach Climate Week NYC 2025, it’s impossible to ignore the heated debates surrounding climate action . Yet, amidst the challenges, there’s also a silver lining: the way these debates have reframed the conversation. More and more, climate is being discussed not just in terms of emissions or policies, but through the lens of what unites us all—our desire for clean air and water, healthy communities, and protected natural places.
This shift matters. It reminds us of a simple truth: we cannot solve climate change without protecting nature, and we cannot protect nature without solving climate change. The climate–nature nexus is not an abstract idea—it’s a recognition that human well-being, economic resilience, and environmental health are deeply interconnected.
The climate–nature nexus
Nature is our greatest ally in addressing climate change. Forests, wetlands, grasslands, and oceans absorb carbon, regulate temperatures, and sustain livelihoods. Coastal ecosystems like mangroves, reefs, and marshes provide natural defenses against floods and storms, while forests filter water and stabilize soils. For too long, these systems were treated as optional add-ons to climate strategies. But the conversation is changing: protecting and restoring ecosystems is increasingly seen as central to climate solutions, not secondary.
When we restore a wetland, we’re not only creating habitat—we’re also filtering drinking water, reducing disaster risks, storing carbon, and supporting local economies. These are benefits everyone can relate to, no matter where they sit on the political spectrum.
Scaling what works
The encouraging news is that we already have many of the tools we need. Payment for ecosystem services, biodiversity credits, blended finance vehicles, and established frameworks for nature-based solutions are no longer experimental—they’re proven approaches. The challenge is to scale them up, moving from pilot projects to landscape- and regional-level transformations.
That means creating financing mechanisms that are standardized and accessible, while also ensuring funding reaches the communities that steward ecosystems most effectively. It requires breaking down barriers that keep capital from flowing to projects with multiple benefits—climate, nature, and people together.
Mobilizing climate finance for nature
Scaling these solutions will not happen without capital. WWF is launching a new area of focus—Nature Finance and Investment — at the Nature Hub during Climate Week. This initiative will spotlight how financial tools can direct resources toward ecosystem protection and restoration, closing the massive funding gap conservation still faces.
By reframing nature as essential economic infrastructure, we can mobilize the investments needed to meet both climate and biodiversity goals. This means building pathways for capital that reward multiple outcomes—emissions reductions, ecosystem services, and community resilience—simultaneously.
Building resilience with nature
Nature is also indispensable to resilience—particularly for vulnerable communities that rely directly on the land and sea for their livelihoods and security. WWF is scaling up its work on resilience to highlight solutions that protect both people and ecosystems. Coastal mangroves, for instance, reduce storm surges while providing fish nurseries and sustaining local economies. Regenerative farming practices safeguard soil, improve yields, and buffer communities against drought.
Equally important is ensuring that Indigenous peoples and local communities, who have long proven to be the most effective stewards of natural systems, are central to this work. Indigenous-led projects around the world demonstrate how traditional knowledge, when paired with climate finance and modern tools, delivers solutions that endure. Supporting and scaling these efforts is one of the most powerful ways to strengthen resilience while honoring shared values of stewardship and care.
Shared values, shared future
Reframing climate through the lens of nature opens the door to broader participation. Conversations about clean air, safe water, thriving ecosystems, and resilient communities resonate widely and cut across divides. These shared values help us build coalitions strong enough to deliver solutions at the speed and scale the planet requires.
Climate Week NYC will be successful if it channels this momentum into concrete commitments with timelines and accountability. Most of all, it should affirm that protecting nature and stabilizing the climate are not separate goals, but two sides of the same coin.
We have the science, the tools, and the resources. What we need now is the collective will—grounded in the values we all share—to act. The silver lining of today’s debates is the reminder that nature gives us common ground. Let’s build on that, together.
