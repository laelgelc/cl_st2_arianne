Manatees love mangroves; they use them for food and a quiet place to rest and raise their young. But these two key features of the Florida coasts are in trouble. There are at least 7,000 manatees estimated to live in Florida, a rebound from previous years, but they continue to face threats. 606 died in 2019 alone - a reduction from almost 800 died in 2018.
