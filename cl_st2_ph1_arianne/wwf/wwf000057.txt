With the 2020 fire season already under way in some places, there’s no doubt: More destructive wildfires are on the horizon. But while climate scientists warn that fires will continue to increase in frequency and intensity as our planet warms, WWF and our many partners are planning ahead, supporting ongoing projects to help foster more resilient ecosystems and ensure that future blazes are less devastating to people and wildlife. In the long term, we will continue to work with Indigenous communities and local organizations to rethink destructive landuse practices in the Amazon and decouple economic growth from environmental degradation. Efforts in Australia, meanwhile, will address the huge loss of forest habitat through climate-smart approaches that restore and protect bushland and help improve land management strategies and fire responses.
As our attention shifts from emergency responses to fully assessing the social, economic, and environmental impacts of out-of-control fires, expert Anita van Breda emphasizes one thing: “We need to keep nature in mind.” Van Breda, who is senior director for environment and disaster management at WWF-US, adds: “For example, we may need to adapt our restoration efforts to be more resilient and plant trees that are better able to survive in a changing climate. Disasters challenge us to think differently about what comes next, to factor in climate science and our capacity to adapt, and to ensure people and nature are better prepared.”
“Building resilience to future shocks in these ecosystems is going to take time; meanwhile, people and ecosystems need help now,” adds Catherine Blancard. “These are challenges that no one institution can solve alone. During the last fire season, we saw a global desire for on-the-ground action and the power of our network to react quickly. As an organization, we’re well-equipped to respond to these kinds of crises—and we’re figuring out how best to do that.”
