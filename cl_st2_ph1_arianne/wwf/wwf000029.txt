When water stops flowing in the streams near Igombavu Village in the southern highlands of Tanzania, it affects more than just the wildlife and surrounding forests. The people of Igombavu and the nearby villages rely on water for their daily needs. When the water runs dry or is contaminated from misuse upstream, women and girls—typically the ones tasked with gathering it—are forced to wake earlier and walk farther each day to find it. And when clean water cannot be found, they go without.
Yet diminished or contaminated water flow is due in part to small-scale farmers using land near the banks of the river to grow vegetables to feed their families or to sell at markets to make an income. Degradation of the banks through farming and contamination from fertilizer runoff decreases water flow and impacts water quality, creating a dilemma of need. How can you continue to provide for your family while also protecting the water source on which you and your neighbors depend?

“Caring for the environment was not known or talked about for most of the community. We were misusing the environment, like cutting trees, planting near the water, and washing our clothes in the streams. But with the Alliance we learned that the health of the environment is for our own health. And now we stand together as a community to protect it.”

“I have gained great confidence. Through being in these groups I can stand up and talk in front of men and ask questions. I used to fear going to meetings. Now when they announce a meeting, I am the first one to be there—to ask questions about village development and other things. I want to see other women develop in this same way.”

“The world has changed, but water remains the same. No water; no life. We conserve the environment so coming generations will find a good and peaceful place to live, so they enjoy it as we enjoy it now.”

“It is very import for women to lead. Women trust their fellow women. Women would just wait for men to bring households needs. But now women are equally contributing to the welfare of the household, they are more active and competing with men and more or less independent. So as women leaders we have sensitized many women and built their confidence, like Samia [Hassan] who is a president and she is doing very well, and we pray she continue to lead the country so that we women follow her steps.”
Drawing from the expertise and experience of both CARE and WWF, the Alliance integrates and innovates within the convergence of development and conservation practices to bring transformational change to communities and the environments surrounding them.
Although the official program closes at the end of 2023, Manzigira and the 20 other groups across the Mufindi and Iringa districts will move forward, benefiting from the knowledge they have gained and the systems and processes they have created together. Together, they will continue to improve their lives and protect the waters and forests they depend on.
