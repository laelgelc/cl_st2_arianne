Every day renewable thermal alternatives to burning fossil fuels become more affordable and efficient. As companies learn more about these developments, weâ€™re seeing more and more make the change to renewables. But significant barriers still exist. At WWF, we helped create the Renewable Thermal Collaborative , an initiative that brings together the combined power and influence of those businesses that make all that stuff we use, wear, and eat to learn from each other, better understand how to transition to renewables, speed technological advancements, and support policies that will speed the adoption of renewable thermal solutions.
