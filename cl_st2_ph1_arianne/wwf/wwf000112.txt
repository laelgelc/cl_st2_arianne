I remember clearly the exact moment when climate change became personal for me.
It was 2010, and I was pregnant with my son. I was skimming an essay about mid-century projections for Arctic sea ice loss, coral reef failure and melting mountaintop glaciers. None of this information was new, but the way it affected me was. My child would be 40 years old in mid-century. Suddenly the enormity of bringing a child into a world where we are already facing climate change hit meâ€”hard.
