Tackling climate change policy is not for the faint of heart. On the federal level in particular, progress on the issue remains largely blocked by partisan politics, a small but hardy group of global-warming deniers, heavy lobbying by conventional energy industries, and concerns about the economic impact of carbon-reduction measures on states that produce fossil-based fuels such as coal. "When you work on climate change, you have to remain an optimist," US Department of Energy official Alice Madden said recently. "Otherwise, it would be hard to get out of bed in the morning."
