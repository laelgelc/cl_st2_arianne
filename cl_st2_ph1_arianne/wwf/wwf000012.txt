String. Toothpaste. Burgers. Fertilizer. Makeup. Printer ink. What do all of these things have in common?
They all can be made with seaweed! Commonly categorized into red, green, and brown species, seaweed is a broad term for plants and algae that live in the ocean. In the US, farming kelp, a brown macroalgae, is a rapidly growing industry. Farmed seaweed is good for people and good for nature!
Here are six facts that you might not know about seaweed.
Kelp is not only delicious, it’s also known as a superfood because it provides valuable nutrients for your body. It supports a healthy gut, and contains antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals, including B12. It’s also pretty much the best source of iodine out there, which is especially important for pregnancy and thyroid issues. In eastern Asia, seaweed has been an integral part of people’s diets for hundreds of years!
Kelp cleans the ocean! The algae absorb excess nutrient runoff, including nitrogen and phosphorous, improving water quality. In Maine’s Boothbay Harbor, for example, researchers are experimenting with planting kelp just to filter wastewater.
