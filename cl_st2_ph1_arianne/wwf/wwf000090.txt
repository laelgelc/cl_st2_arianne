Maps have always fascinated me . As a visual learner, I’ve been drawn to their design, colors, and ability to tell stories. But it wasn’t until I studied geographic information systems (GIS) in graduate school that I realized how maps could be more than just beautiful—they could be powerful tools for conservation.
At their core, maps are visual representations of places, allowing us to see patterns, relationships, and changes over time. Maps play a crucial role in answering fundamental ‘where’ and ‘how’ questions in conservation. We use them to understand how much forests remain intact, where animals migrate, or where wildfires are currently burning. These insights help guide what actions we take. For example, maps can show where elephants move in relation to where people live, helping conservationists develop strategies to reduce conflicts.

In my work, I rely on maps to understand environments, plan conservation actions, and measure outcomes. If we’re restoring mangrove forests, for instance, mapping recent storm events and where people live nearby helps us decide where to plant new trees and where to set up protection zones. Afterward, we use satellite images and field surveys to monitor changes in tree cover and fish populations, showing the impact of our efforts.
Despite their usefulness, maps are simplifications of the real world, and no model is perfect. One major challenge in conservation mapping is data accuracy. Two maps of the same forest can show different results, depending on the data used. This can lead to confusion and even distrust. To ensure accuracy, we must source data carefully, cross-reference findings, and visually inspect maps for errors.
Another challenge is distortion. Because the Earth is a three-dimensional sphere, flattening it onto a map always introduces some level of inaccuracy. I like to compare it to peeling an orange and trying to flatten the peel without breaking it—an impossible task. We use different techniques to minimize these distortions and make maps as reliable as possible.

Innovations in mapping technology are rapidly transforming conservation. Drone and LiDAR imagery are providing ultra-high-resolution views of landscapes in 3D, helping us monitor forests, coastlines, and even landslides. I’m also interested in seeing how artificial intelligence (AI) continues to develop, as it has the potential to help conservationists process data faster and more efficiently. AI tools could assist in identifying data sources, automating mapping processes, and even predicting environmental changes.
Above all, maps must be accessible. They should be readable in multiple languages, consider color-vision impairments, and be culturally appropriate. Making mapping tools widely available ensures that local communities and Indigenous peoples—who have been stewarding their lands for generations—can actively contribute to conservation efforts while maintaining control over how their knowledge is represented and shared.
The lands and waters most critical for biodiversity have been cared for by Indigenous peoples for millennia, and their deep understanding of these places holds invaluable insights. Many forms of mapping can help preserve this knowledge and share it in ways that respect cultural traditions and governance systems. True conservation is not just about protecting landscapes; it is about honoring and integrating the knowledge of those who have long been their stewards.
Maps do more than guide us from one place to another. They tell stories, bring people together, and provide a roadmap for protecting the planet. With new technologies and a commitment to accessibility, the future of conservation mapping holds endless possibilities.
