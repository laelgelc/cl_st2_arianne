Freshwater ecosystems, including rivers, lakes, and wetlands, play a critical role in mitigating and adapting to climate change. They act as natural sponges that absorb excess rainfall, reduce flood risk, and sequester carbon in peatlands. These ecosystems also regulate local microclimates, providing cooling effects during heat waves and buffering against cold spells. Despite the vital role that healthy rivers, lakes and wetlands play in water security, they continue to disappear at a shocking rate. One-third of the world's wetlands have been lost in the past 50 years, and freshwater habitats are in worse condition than forests, grasslands, or coastal systems.
With water risks and water-related impacts of climate change worsening across the globe, securing a water-positive future for species and communities around the world has never been more important. This is why countries have united under the Freshwater Challenge. Here’s what you need to know to understand this global initiative.
What is the Freshwater Challenge? In response to the escalating water crisis and the impacts of climate change, The Freshwater Challenge was launched in March 2023 during the UN Water Conference in New York. This ambitious initiative aims to restore 300,000 kilometers of degraded rivers and 350 million hectares of wetlands by 2030 , while conserving intact freshwater ecosystems. The Freshwater Challenge sets a bold goal to accelerate climate action, boost water, food, and energy security, reverse nature loss, and drive sustainable development. By focusing on the restoration and conservation of freshwater ecosystems, the initiative addresses multiple environmental and societal challenges.
Who is part of the Freshwater Challenge? Spearheaded by the governments of Colombia, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ecuador, Gabon, Mexico, and Zambia, the Freshwater Challenge is a global, country-led initiative. As of July 2024, it boasts 45 member countries and the European Union, and is supported by organizations including Conservation International, IUCN, the Secretariat of the Convention on Wetlands, The Nature Conservancy, Wetlands International, OECD, UNEP, and WWF.
Has the US committed to the challenge? The United States announced its participation in the Freshwater Challenge at COP28 in December 2023. Subsequently, the Biden-Harris Administration launched the America the Beautiful Freshwater Challenge in April 2024 , setting ambitious national goals. These include reconnecting, restoring, and protecting 8 million acres of wetlands and 100,000 miles of rivers and streams by 2030 , focusing on approaches like removing impediments and stream bank restoration.
Does it overlap with existing targets? The Freshwater Challenge is designed to work within countries' existing conservation and restoration processes, making it easy to integrate water-related targets without imposing new commitments. Participating countries are expected to set national targets for restoring and conserving rivers and wetlands by 2030, in alignment with the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework.
Is a financial commitment required? Joining the Freshwater Challenge does not require any financial commitment. Countries can choose to provide financial support voluntarily, but there is no obligation. This allows countries to focus on setting and achieving their restoration and conservation targets without the pressure of additional financial burdens.
How is it implemented? Participating countries decide which rivers and wetlands to restore and conserve. They are encouraged to use a participatory approach and can seek guidance from freshwater experts within the supporting organizations listed above and including WWF.
Do nature-based solutions play a role? Restoration and conservation efforts can be undertaken by governments, companies, or communities. Nature-based solutions play a critical role, particularly for climate adaptation and disaster risk reduction. The primary objective is to ensure that the overall targets for restoring and conserving freshwater ecosystems are met.
The Freshwater Challenge represents a united global effort to restore and protect vital freshwater ecosystems. By setting ambitious goals, fostering international collaboration, and promoting nature-based solutions, the initiative aims to secure a resilient and sustainable future for freshwater resources. Scaling up efforts requires public and private action, financial and political support, and community engagement to deliver nature-based solutions. As more countries join and commit to this challenge, the collective impact will help mitigate climate change, enhance water security, and support biodiversity, benefiting communities and ecosystems worldwide.
