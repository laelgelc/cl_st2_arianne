Imagine a flower that resembles the claw of an arcade toy machine. Now add hairs and a musty odor. It’s Ceropegia Foetidiflora, a plant recently identified in the forested hills of northeastern Thailand.
The plant is just one of the 110 species that were recorded by scientists in 2018 and 2019 throughout Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, and Viet Nam. A new WWF report details a vibrant diversity of plants and vertebrate animals—the report excludes insects, fungi, and mollusks—which have never been scientifically identified.
Check out five species from the report:
Identified by researchers exploring northwestern Viet Nam, Rohdea Harderi yields smooth, bright red or orange fruits. It’s even able to fertilize itself! The plant’s habitat is threatened by illegal logging and unsustainable agriculture.
Identified on a forest path in the central highlands of Viet Nam, Dominic’s reed snake (Calamaria Dominici) can be recognized by its uneven yellow and purplish-black spots. The snake’s only home continues to be threatened by illegal logging and mining as well as the illegal wildlife trade.
Identified in the sandy soil and evergreen forest hills of northeastern Thailand, the plant Ceropegia Foetidiflora emits a musty stench and is covered with hair.
Identified in the Mekong River drainage basin in Laos, the freshwater fish Rhyacoschistura Larreci can be recognized by its erratically shaped body. It sports a pelvic fin and a bony flap under its eye. The fish’s air bladder, a gas-filled sac that helps to regulate its depth, is divided into two halves.
Identified in western Myanmar, researchers came across the Ywangan crocodile newt (Tylototriton Ngarsuensis) while they were studying frogs. Locals have known about the newt for generations, but it had yet to be scientifically cataloged. The newts’ forest home is under threat from illegal mining and logging, while the illegal wildlife trade poses additional risk.
