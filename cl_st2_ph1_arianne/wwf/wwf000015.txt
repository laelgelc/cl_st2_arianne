A warming climate is changing our world. While we can’t turn back time, we can make life on Earth as resilient to change as possible. One solution already exists: Mangrove forests are powerful ecosystems that can help us mitigate and adapt to climate change . However, climate change is negatively impacting mangroves, and conservationists need to use improved, climate-informed management to give these coastal forests the best chance to thrive into the future. To support such management, WWF and partners at the University of Queensland, Australia have developed a new method, known as the “Climate-Smart Mangrove Tool,” to help experts make the best decisions for people and nature’s long-term survival in a changing climate.
Mangrove trees are found on five of seven continents. While they are incredibly adaptable, they’re not immune to climate-related stress. “Mangroves grow along coastlines, meaning they’re at risk under a changing climate,” explains Dominic Andradi-Brown, lead marine conservation Scientist at WWF and one of the leads in the tool’s development. “More storms with stronger winds, causing higher waves and deeper and longer-lasting floods, can kill or weaken mangroves.”
This is bad news not only for these coastal forests and nearby communities that benefit from them but also for our efforts to slow down climate change. Mangrove trees store tons of carbon—three to four times more than other tropical rainforests and when the forests are damaged or destroyed, we lose a valuable nature-based solution .
