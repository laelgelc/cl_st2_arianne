The global plastic pollution crisis poses a great danger to people, wildlife, and the planet. For two years, leaders worldwide have been working to create an international agreement to change how we produce, consume, and discard high-risk plastic.
At the end of November, final negotiations about a legally binding global plastics treaty will take place in Korea. This is the last critical moment to prevent irreversible economic, health, and environmental damage from plastic pollution.
Read on to learn more about the negotiations, WWF’s role in enacting change, and why we must reach an agreement.
Launched in late 2022 by the United Nations General Assembly, the INC on Plastic Pollution is a diverse coalition of representatives from various countries working to forge the world’s first legally binding treaty to tackle plastic pollution. The mission is to address the entire life cycle of plastics—from their production to their disposal. Establishing a binding international agreement would significantly reduce the environmental and health impacts of plastic pollution, creating a cleaner, healthier planet for future generations.
Over the past two years, WWF has championed the essential elements needed to make this treaty a true success. To get there, we have mobilized voices across society—working with non-governmental organizations, businesses, and individuals to keep up the momentum. Engaging the private sector is especially pivotal because businesses now have a rare opportunity to use their influence for meaningful impact. As these final negotiations determine the treaty’s outcome, WWF is urging world leaders to commit to a bold, effective agreement that can drive real change.
The world has a critical opportunity to make history in the fight against plastic pollution. To ensure this treaty truly serves people and the planet, WWF has outlined four key priorities that states must secure as a baseline in the final treaty negotiations:
Global bans and phase-outs on harmful plastics and chemicals: Eliminating the most dangerous plastics and toxic chemicals is vital to protect ecosystems and human health.
Establish product design standards for a non-toxic, circular economy: Worldwide requirements for safe, sustainable design will make plastics reusable, recyclable, and free from harmful substances.
Aligned financial support for transformative system changes: Sufficient funding and resources are needed to support countries in building effective systems to address plastic waste at scale.
Mechanisms to strengthen and evolve over time: A resilient treaty must adapt to emerging challenges with built-in flexibility to strengthen and update standards as needed.
These priorities are essential to crafting a treaty that can drive transformative, lasting change, creating a future where plastic pollution no longer threatens our health, wildlife, or environment.
INC-5 is the final scheduled negotiation session during which countries are expected to reach a consensus on a legally binding agreement. As the last step in the two-year negotiation process, this final meeting represents the closing opportunity for nations to tackle unresolved issues, such as capping plastic production, establishing clear global standards for sustainable product design, and setting up systems to support waste management in low-resource regions.
In short, INC-5 is the decisive moment to lock in ambitious goals and secure the treaty’s success, making it a pivotal turning point for global environmental protection.
The stakes could not be higher: a treaty that falls short could mean locking in decades of plastic waste, chemical pollution, and avoidable harm to both human and planetary health.
Governments need to commit to ambitious, enforceable global rules on plastic pollution. Without such commitments, plastic pollution could triple by 2040. Experts warn that the absence of strong, enforceable measures will lead to escalating plastic pollution, with environmental and public health consequences—particularly for coastal and lower-income communities most impacted by waste. Given the urgency of the plastic crisis, INC-5 holds the potential to establish transformative standards—or leave the world without the accessible tools to combat the pollution threatening our oceans, ecosystems, and health, significantly complicating the fight against plastic pollution.
