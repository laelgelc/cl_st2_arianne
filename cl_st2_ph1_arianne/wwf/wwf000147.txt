The Northern Great Plains, one of the world's only remaining intact temperate grasslands, has faced numerous challenges that have impacted its array of wildlife and plants over the past 200 years. One of the greatest threats to the future of these grasslands is plow-up—the replacement of native grasslands with row crop agriculture. In the past 15 years, nearly 33 million acres of grasslands across the US and Canadian regions of the Great Plains have been destroyed, primarily for commodity crops. The sustainable ranching community is the leading line of defense against further expansion of plow-up. Surprisingly, one key to ensuring a future for these grasslands and the wildlife they harbor may lie with an unexpected ally: the domestic cow.
Historically, bison roamed the Great Plains, their grazing and migration patterns aerating soil and fertilizing it with manure. This process promoted plant growth and supported biodiversity. With bison herds now primarily found on lands belonging to Native Nations, national parks, and other federally owned and managed lands, domesticated cattle have assumed this crucial ecological role. Today, sustainable ranching practices are essential to transform the activities of livestock into agents of grassland regeneration.
Launched in 2011, WWF’s Sustainable Ranching Initiative (SRI) fosters symbiotic relationships between humans and wildlife in the Great Plains. By collaborating with ranchers, rural communities, and landowner-led organizations, the initiative promotes improved grazing management practices and native grassland reseeding. This rancher-led approach allows cattle to thrive within a healthy ecosystem, protecting the region's vital grasslands and enhancing plant and animal life.
Clay Bolt, celebrated conservation photographer and WWF's Northern Great Plains communications manager, documents the rich biodiversity flourishing on and around sustainably managed ranches. His photos capture the vibrant life that emerges from the symbiosis between humans and wildlife in the Great Plains.
Often pollinated by moths and other nocturnal pollinators, the delicate evening primrose ( Oenothera biennis) is a wildflower that blooms in the late afternoon. Possessing amazing medicinal benefits, Native Americans use a paste made from these flowers to treat bruises, wounds, and inflammations.

This endearing pronghorn ( Antilocapra americana ) poses for a photo in a lush prairie. Despite its unassuming appearance, the pronghorn is a phenomenal athlete and the world's second-fastest land animal. While cheetahs can reach a top speed of 61 mph, pronghorns can sustain speeds of 60 mph for much longer. Often mistakenly thought of as an antelope, these ancient mammals are more closely related to giraffes.

A wary prairie rattlesnake (C rotalus viridis) peers out from its home in an abandoned animal burrow. This snake can grow up to five feet long and is a surprisingly capable swimmer. Despite their fearsome reputation, prairie rattlesnakes are generally shy creatures that avoid confrontation and are vital members of the grasslands community.

An observant short-eared owl ( Asio flammeus) curiously stares down Bolt’s camera while hovering over the prairie. This owl is a phenomenal flier, often crossing vast oceans and completing migrations of up to 1,200 miles in distance. In addition to calling the Great Plains its home, the short-eared owl can be found hanging loose in the Hawaiian Islands.
