While making the 15-mile journey from his home in Shishmaref, Alaska, to his grandfather’s cabin two years ago, Gabriel Stenek reached the narrow lagoon that separates the barrier island on which he lives from the mainland and saw an unusual sight for March: water glistening in puddles on top of the ice. Typically, the lagoon is frozen solid that time of year, forming a sort of bridge he can cross safely on his snowmobile. Now, he wasn’t sure if the melting ice would support his weight. He sped full throttle across the channel.
Thankfully, Stenek made it home safely. But he knows of others who haven’t been so lucky. “That was a really scary experience,” he says. “The whole time I was thinking about community members who have fallen through the ice and lost their lives.”
For Stenek, an Arctic Youth Ambassador, such tragedies underscore the biggest problems facing Shishmaref, a remote Inupiat community of about 600 people. Located on a tiny island in the Chukchi Sea, just north of the Bering Strait and 20 miles below the Arctic Circle, Shishmaref has struggled for decades with coastal erosion and flooding attributed to climate change. But as temperatures in the Arctic rise at a pace twice as fast as the rest of the world, sea ice that once buffered Shishmaref’s coast is forming later in the fall and melting earlier in the spring. With an increasingly exposed shoreline, the island is crumbling into the sea, threatening an entire community and their way of life.
