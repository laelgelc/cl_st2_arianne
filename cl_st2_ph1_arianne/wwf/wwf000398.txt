In a workshop along a well-traveled elephant path in the Zambian bush, local craftswomen create handcrafted jewelry inspired by their surroundings. Sharing stories and ideas, they work with natural and locally sourced materials from the South Luangwa valley.
Featured in the collection is jewelry fashioned from deadly snare wire removed by antipoaching patrols. Snare wire that kills and injures many of the region’s wildlife is instead coiled and flattened to create beauty from brutality.
Gifts that give back, these designs support critical efforts to save elephants, big cats and antelope. And in an area where unemployment and poaching are a harsh reality, every piece of jewelry sold also helps the women artisans reinvest in their community, support their families and preserve the unique place that inspires their work.
With the support of WWF, Zambia—along with Angola, Botswana, Namibia, and Zimbabwe—established the Kavango Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area (KAZA), the world’s largest transboundary protected area encompassing 106 million acres in South Africa. Today, we work together to prevent poaching, conduct wildlife research, promote habitat protection, and identify opportunities for communities to manage and benefit from wildlife on their land.
