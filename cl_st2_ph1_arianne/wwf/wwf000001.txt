In some places along the Rio Grande in New Mexico, communities still divert water through traditional acequias. These small, hand-dug irrigation canals date back to the 1500s, when Spanish colonizers conquered and settled the region.
Indigenous communities had long employed dryland farming, river flood irrigation, and small ditches to grow crops, but the Spanish expanded irrigation as they sought to establish colonies and cultivate valley bottomlands.
In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the U.S. government enticed Anglo farmers to settle the region by building bigger and more complex engineering feats. That infrastructure, along with new schemes of managing and allocating waters, supplanted acequias. But traditional acequias persist, particularly in northern New Mexico. And even today, they are still maintained communally: Everyone is responsible for caring for the canals, and in drought, everyone shares what water there is.
It’s a culture close to the heart of Enrique Prunes, WWF US’s Rio Grande Manager and Freshwater Lead Specialist.
Growing up in Chihuahua City, Mexico, Prunes spent summers, holidays, and weekends with his mother’s family in Valle de Allende, a centuries-old Spanish missionary town along the Rio Valle de Allende, where some of the region’s first acequias were established—and are still used and cared for today.
“I grew up there, diverting water with my uncle and my grandma, to the pecan tree orchards and green chiles and potatoes,” Prunes says. “I think that’s a big part of how I ended up in river conservation.”
