As WWF celebrates the 30th anniversary of the Russell E. Train Education for Nature Program (EFN) , we are proud to announce the 2024 recipients of institutional grants. This milestone marks three decades of fostering environmental stewardship through local institutions across Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean.
Since the first grants to community-based organizations in 1997 and the launch of the Train Legacy Program in 2016, which supports EFN alumni-led, conservation-focused university programs, WWF has supported over 600 institutions. These grants have helped build capacity for local communities and early-career leaders, ensuring the preservation of biodiversity while connecting nature with people.
Thirteen community-based organizations and one academic institution across 10 countries have been awarded these prestigious grants, continuing WWF’s commitment to inclusive conservation by supporting local organizations in strengthening education, training, and community empowerment. From advancing long-term forest restoration in Cameroon to nurturing the next generation of leaders in Brazil, the 2024 cohort continues to expand opportunities to collaborate with local and Indigenous communities to improve the health of forests and provide locally led solutions.
"A growing body of research on inclusive conservation highlights that conservation efforts are more successful and resilient when led by local communities who have the Indigenous and traditional knowledge of their lands and biodiversity," said Nelly Kadagi, director of EFN.
We are immensely grateful to celebrate 30 years of support from dedicated EFN alumni, the remarkable generosity of public and private partners, and the unwavering commitment of visionary leaders. Their collective contributions have ensured local leaders have the resources and opportunities to thrive over the past three decades.
We’re looking forward to what we can achieve together over the next 30 years. The complexity and gravity of today’s conservation challenges require an inclusive, collaborative approach. We must be bolder in building solid relationships to sustain and increase access to conservation leadership, leveraging one of WWF’s most valuable assets: the extensive EFN network of global conservation leaders.

Assessment of the socio-economic and ecological values of the seagrass meadows, case of Ranobe Bay, South-West Madagascar Seagrass beds are a marine ecosystem often referred to as a "blue carbon ecosystem" because they can sequester more than 15% of the total carbon stock in the oceans. This ecosystem covers around 10% of the surface of the world's coastal zones, but 30% of which have been degraded worldwide over the last 30 years, which is leading to the loss of their ecosystem services and values. This degradation can also lead to a reduction of income to the community of fishers. Therefore, this project seeks to understand the status of the seagrass ecosystem in Ranobe Bay, southwest of Madagascar, while also identifying and assessing the pressures and threats affecting it. Additionally, this project will evaluate the socio-economic values of the seagrass meadows as a fishing zone frequented by small-scale fishers. Raising awareness of this issue in the local community is necessary to improve their knowledge of the conservation challenges facing this ecosystem and to mobilize the community to work,restore, and conserve this habitat.

Gabriel Garcia’s research will focus on analyzing existing environmental compensation programs in the state of São Paulo. Many companies and municipal environmental departments rely on actions that overlook biodiversity, the native species of each region, and the landscape and urban impact, which disrupts the dynamic balance of natural ecosystems. His research will include a literature review of these programs and propose an approach that prioritizes biodiversity, native flora and fauna, and urban planning. The goal is to develop a strategy for urban afforestation as a method to offset the carbon footprint of industrial and commercial activities.

Rafaela Azzolin aims to assess the impact of monocultures on the diversity of wildlife mammals in modified areas within Brazil’s Cerrado using camera traps. The Cerrado is the second largest biome in Brazil, considered the richest savanna in the world and one of the global "hotspots" for biodiversity conservation. The waters originating from this biome sustain six of Brazil's eight major river basins. Over the years, the Cerrado has undergone significant habitat conversion due to the expansion of agricultural frontiers. Conserving the Cerrado is essential to maintaining ecosystem services, ensuring water supply for Brazilian regions, and protecting biodiversity, especially endemic species, to promote a balanced environment worldwide. Rafaela’s study will be conducted on five agricultural properties, with 25 camera traps installed at interface locations between cropland and legal reserves. Based on the results, it will be possible to estimate in which monoculture, at which crop cycle, and during which period the highest species diversity occurred.
