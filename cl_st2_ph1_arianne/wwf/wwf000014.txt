On the surface, brown-colored kelp might not look like the most exciting organism. But when it comes to tackling climate change, this large algae—one of around 12,000 species of seaweed worldwide—has superpowers. It can store greenhouse gases, reduce the carbon footprint of the global food system, help coastal communities adapt to climate impacts, and even be made into a climate-friendly alternative to plastic!
Here are seven seaweed superpowers that help the climate.
Produced by burning fossil fuels, excess CO2 in the Earth’s atmosphere is one of the largest drivers of climate change. By taking up carbon from its ocean environment, seaweed can play an important role in tackling climate change. As seaweed grows, pieces fall off and drift to the seafloor, storing away carbon. In fact, studies have shown that seaweed beds worldwide store as much carbon as mangroves, seagrasses, and salt marshes combined!
Agriculture is a large contributor to the greenhouse gas emissions driving climate change. The production of soy and beef, for example, is driving deforestation in the Amazon as more land is cleared to make way for crop fields.
Here’s the good news: Seaweed farming has a very low carbon footprint. It doesn’t need land or freshwater, nor does it need pesticides or fertilizers, which avoids harmful impacts on ecosystems. Shifting human diets to include more seaweed helps to avoid more resource and emissions-intensive foods and crops that put pressure on our ecosystems.
Plus, seaweed is delicious! Whether served as a refreshing salad or in a sizzling burger, it can be a nutritious addition to our diets.
