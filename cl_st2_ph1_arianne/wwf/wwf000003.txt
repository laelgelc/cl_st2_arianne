One look at a sea otter, and it’s easy to understand why for so many it’s love at first sight. Their charming demeanor and fluffy faces beckon as they snack and float on their backs. But more than their apparent cuteness, sea otters are critical players in marine ecosystems and a keystone species, meaning they have a profound effect on their ecosystem. Sea otters are vital to kelp forests, ensuring the health and carbon storage abilities of these important ecosystems.
So, while they are exceptionally cute, sea otters are worthy of adding an additional accolade to their roster— climate hero.
Here’s how otters help the planet:
Sea otters and kelp have developed a close partnership over the years. Sea otters will wrap themselves in kelp, or use it as an anchor, when feeding or resting while floating together in what are known as “rafts,” or groups of over 10 individuals. Researchers have even found that sea otters are able to escape shark bites more easily when swimming among heavier kelp canopies.
