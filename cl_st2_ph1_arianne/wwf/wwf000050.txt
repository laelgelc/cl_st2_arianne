In the coastal village of Ryrkaipiy in Chukotka, Russia, wildlife dominates, and polar bears, not people, are the landlords.
As the sea ice polar bears depend upon disappears more and more each year as a result of climate change, polar bears are forced onto land in search of food and have become a more common sight in Arctic communities, bringing them into greater conflict with people. Every fall, the Ryrkaipiy polar bear patrol, with the support of WWF Russia, works to protect the community and prevent human-wildlife conflict. Tatyana Minenko has been leading the patrol team since 2006. That’s when climate change increased conflict in her village. In Ryrkaipiy, walrus gather ( haul out ) near the village every Fall, attracting polar bears along with them. Adult Pacific walrus use sea ice as a platform to rest on and leave their calves when they dive for food. With sea ice retreating north and no longer reaching the walrus’ feeding areas, the animals are forced to gather on shore, closer to people. The area surrounding Ryrkaipiy has turned into the westernmost haul-out of Pacific walrus. Sometimes their numbers reach tens of thousands.
