On a stretch of grassland on the western side of Placencia Lagoon, Marisa Tellez visits a Morelet’s crocodile, lovingly named Savannah. Savannah is one of five “Crocodile Ambassadors” under the care of the Crocodile Research Coalition (CRC) that are unable to live in the wild due to injuries and overfamiliarity to humans.
Tellez tosses a chunk of fresh chicken to Savannah who snaps it up before following Tellez around the enclosure. “As you can tell, she always wants to be the star of the show,” she says.
Though it’s illegal to keep crocodiles as pets in Belize, Savannah was held captive for years before being rescued by the Forest Department in 2023. As a result of poor nutrition, Savannah suffers from underdeveloped teeth and stunted growth—unable to survive without the help of CRC.
Tellez has devoted her life to this species, first as a biologist and now as the Executive Director of the Crocodile Research Coalition, a nonprofit she founded in 2016 to support the conservation of crocodiles and their habitats. Crocodiles keep aquatic ecosystems in balance as apex predators, but they also hold a cultural significance in Central America.
“Communities have coexisted with these reptiles for [millennia],” says Tellez. “Conserving crocodiles and other wildlife allows us to preserve a piece of who we are.”
The CRC is also known for its regular “Croc Talk” visits to schools and summer camps across Belize. In these sessions, community members learn about crocodile diets and behaviors, and long-lost cultural ties to crocodiles. Participants leave with a better understanding of how to become a better champion for wildlife.
Because crocodiles require specific habitat conditions to thrive, like adequate prey populations and clean freshwater swamps, their abundance indicates a healthy ecosystem, and their decline, according to Tellez, reflects broader environmental changes around Placencia.
“Right now, the biggest ecological threat around Placencia Lagoon is the loss of mangroves,” she says. “Losing mangroves means losing other wildlife and affects the water quality and ultimately our communities.”
Starting in the 1980s, native mangrove forests were threatened or destroyed by the construction of hotels, resorts, and residential enclaves. Though mangroves are legally protected in Belize, illegal clear-cutting still occurs. The mangroves in Placencia Lagoon are particularly vulnerable to clearing—both permitted and illegal—as the Lagoon becomes a burgeoning tourist destination on the coast.
