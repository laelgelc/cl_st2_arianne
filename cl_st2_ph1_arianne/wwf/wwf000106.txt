When we think of the impact of climate change on the world’s ice, we usually think first of the North and South Poles. And for good reason: Greenland and Antarctica’s huge ice sheets hold roughly 75 percent of the world’s fresh water. Warming temperatures in both regions is already causing dangerous amounts of that ice to melt in coming decades. But the poles aren’t the only ice storehouses threatened by climate change— there’s another in Central Asia that’s so large it’s often called the Third Pole.
Overlapping heavily with snow leopard habitat, the Third Pole encompasses the snow-covered mountains surrounding the Tibetan Plateau. It holds the largest store of permanent ice and permafrost outside the poles themselves. The region also contains the world’s highest peaks, an incredible variety of ethnic communities, and stunning biodiversity (including endangered snow leopards). The Pole’s thousands of glaciers and regular snow melt form the headwaters for 10 of Asia’s biggest rivers, which bring drinking water, power and irrigation directly to 210 million people, while these river basins indirectly support more than 1.3 billion people.
