As climate change continues to drive environmental shifts, another growing threat is emerging: human-wildlife conflict. Both people and wildlife are being pushed into closer proximity in search of increasingly scarce natural resources. This means a greater potential for negative interactions, and these conflicts are only expected to become more frequent as droughts, unpredictable rainfalls, and shifting weather patterns escalate.
Rural communities living near wildlife areas are the most acutely affected by human-wildlife conflict as they share the landscape. Wildlife can venture into nearby villages in search of food or water, sometimes damaging crops, attacking livestock, and destroying property.
WWF’s Climate Crowd initiative—which studies how climate change is impacting people and landscapes and then implements on-the-ground solutions—found human-wildlife conflict to be a recurring theme in its data analysis. A recent Climate Crowd report, based on an analysis of over 3,000 key-informant interviews from communities living near biodiversity hotspots, found that a fourth of all interviews mention human-wildlife conflict as an impact of climate change. The results verified what many communities already know firsthand: the ways people and wildlife respond to climate stressors are deeply interconnected and often impact one another.
In fact, much of this conflict is rooted in the same cause—resources are disappearing, and both humans and animals are trying to adapt.
36% of respondents from the data subset reported more crop damage from wildlife as animals roam into farms in search of food.
35% of respondents said they’re encroaching deeper into wildlife habitats to find land or water.
43% of respondents acknowledged that their own coping strategies—like cutting deeper into forests or farming along riverbanks—are further degrading ecosystems and wildlife habitats.
