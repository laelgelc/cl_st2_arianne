Growing up, nature was never something separate from life—it was woven into everything around me.
My earliest memories are from my grandparents' house in India. Smells of tulsi plants and marigolds. I would watch my grandparents place bright orange garlands on the statues for temple offerings. I learned early that certain trees were sacred—the coconut tree that shaded their front yard was a living ancestor, the tulsi plant by the doorstep a daily blessing. Rivers were never just rivers; they were goddesses, storytellers, lifelines.
In our world, everything natural was alive, deserving of respect. No one ever called it "conservation." It was simply how you lived.
In my mother's childhood home, nothing was wasted, and everything had a purpose. She still remembers tying together dried coconut sticks to make brooms, using the fibrous husks as scrubs to clean vessels, and placing hard coconut shells over the fire to boil water for baths and cooking. Every part of the tree was useful, which is why it's known as Kalpavriksha—the "wish-fulfilling tree." The same respect extended to cows, often called Kamadhenu , the divine giver of all sustenance. My mother made cow dung cakes with her bare hands and applied them to the mud floor of their home—a natural disinfectant, pest repellent, and thermal insulator all in one. Even the cow urine was saved and used as a cleaning agent. These weren't just survival techniques—they were everyday acts of care, passed down by women who knew how to live gently and wisely with the earth.
They taught by doing. No lectures, just a thousand tiny rituals that made sustainability an unspoken law.
As I got older, traveled across many countries, and studied conservation formally, I realized how deeply those lessons were already in my blood. And how many different cultures incorporate the same values.

They were not ancient relics to admire; they were blueprints for survival.
Today, I see South Asian women, young and old environmentalists alike, carrying these same instincts forward in powerful new ways. They are conservationists working on human-wildlife conflict with elusive snow leopards in the Himalayas , farmers reviving ancient grain varieties that can survive floods and droughts, and community leaders building organizations to defend sacred groves and forests that have sustained local villages for generations. We are policy advocates, wildlife veterinarians, seed savers, and educators—merging tradition with science, memory with innovation.
Our work feels both ancient and urgent, rooted and visionary.
It's no coincidence. Across South Asia, women have long been the keepers of land and water, though their labor often went unnoticed. From village women replanting mangroves after floods to the bold leaders of the climate fight today, South Asian women have long been protectors of land, water, and life.
We bring with us a different model of leadership: one that is collaborative, resilient, and deeply tied to place. It's leadership that says: protecting nature is not just about saving rare species; it's about saving ways of life, ways of knowing, ways of being that are intricately tied to the earth.

For me, this connection between culture and conservation is personal.
It's in the way my mother still rinses every last grain of rice from a pot. It's in the way my grandparents spoke about rivers with reverence, as if talking about an old family friend. It's in the way we use banana leaves as plates during weddings, reducing so much waste. And it's in the way I now set the table with steel plates and keep empty yogurt containers for leftovers—small habits that feel ordinary but are rooted in generations of thoughtful living.
When I think about the future of conservation, I picture it looking a lot like a coconut tree: strong and generous, offering shade, sustenance, and stories to everyone who gathers underneath. I know that South Asian women—carrying inherited wisdom in one hand and new tools in the other—will be among those tending it, nurturing it, and helping it grow.
Because for us, conservation isn't just about protecting something. It's about remembering where we come from—and building a future where everyone and everything can thrive.
