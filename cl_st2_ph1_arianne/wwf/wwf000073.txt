Each spring and fall, a haunting, bugling call echoes across the skies of the American Southwest. It belongs to the sandhill crane—a tall, graceful bird with ash-gray plumage, a crimson crown, and an unmistakable presence. These ancient birds, with fossilized ancestors dating back 2.5 million years, are among North America's most iconic migratory species.
They travel thousands of miles every year between their breeding grounds in the northern US, Canada, and even Siberia, and their wintering sites in the southern US and Mexico. Along the way, they rely on a few critical stopover habitats to rest and refuel. One of the most important of these lifelines? The Rio Grande .
Sandhill cranes are among the tallest birds in North America, standing up to four feet high with a wingspan that can stretch over six feet. They're often seen in family groups or large flocks, performing elaborate courtship dances—bowing, leaping, and tossing sticks or grass into the air. These displays aren’t just for show; they strengthen pair bonds that can last a lifetime.
Cranes are omnivores with varied diets that include seeds, grains, tubers, insects, and even small vertebrates. This adaptability helps them survive across a wide range of ecosystems, from wetlands and grasslands to croplands.
They are also incredibly social. During migration and winter, sandhill cranes gather by the thousands, their calls creating a chorus that fills the landscape with wild energy. In New Mexico’s Middle Rio Grande Valley, this spectacle reaches its peak each winter, drawing both bird lovers and the birds themselves to Bosque del Apache National Wildlife Refuge and surrounding lands.
The Rio Grande is more than a river—it's a lifeline for wildlife and people alike. As one of the few wetland-rich corridors in the arid Southwest, it offers a rare oasis for migrating cranes to rest, feed, and regain strength before continuing their journeys. But like many rivers in the region, the Rio Grande faces serious challenges: overuse, drought, fragmented habitats, and climate change have all taken a toll on the river’s health.
Without dependable water flows and wetlands, stopover sites dry up. For sandhill cranes and other migratory species, that loss can mean longer, riskier flights with fewer places to land safely.
WWF is working to protect and restore the Rio Grande for wildlife and communities alike. Our efforts focus on:
Reviving wetland habitats that sustain cranes, beavers, fish, and native plants
Collaborating with Indigenous and local communities to protect culturally and ecologically significant lands
Advocating for sustainable water management that balances the needs of people and nature
Reconnecting rivers and restoring natural flows to ensure the entire ecosystem can thrive
By supporting science-based restoration and community-led conservation, we’re helping to create a future where sandhill cranes can continue their ancient migrations—and where the Rio Grande remains a vibrant, living river for generations to come.
Every action matters. Supporting conservation groups, visiting nature reserves responsibly, and raising awareness about the importance of healthy rivers can all make a difference. Right now, you can ask Congress to support funding for key freshwater programs including Rio Grande restoration. The next time you hear the wild call of a sandhill crane, remember the river that helped it get there—and the people working to keep that river alive.
