For 30 years the Russell E. Train Education for Nature Program (EFN) has provided financial support to conservation leaders in Africa, Asia, and Latin America to gain the skills and knowledge they need to address the conservation challenges in their home countries. EFN supports conservationists to pursue graduate studies, attend short-term training courses, and train local communities in WWF priority places. Since 1994, EFN has supported 3,700 individuals and 600 institutions in 60 countries.

To reflect on the 30th anniversary of EFN, WWF asked alumni of the program about the impact they feel EFN has had on their conservation journey.
“I am a biologist with a master's degree in conservation and wildlife management and currently a Ph.D. candidate in conservation and management of tropical forests and biodiversity. I was first funded by EFN in 2023 with a scholarship to support my Ph.D. research but EFN has also impacted my graduate process by making me part of an incredible network of conservationists all around the world. I am happy to be part of this network and for all the opportunities related to it. Let's keep on working to make this a better world!”
-- Bárbara Escobar-Anleu, Guatemala
“In 2017, I received funding from the EFN to attend a prominent conference on coral reef conservation and research. This opportunity enabled me to advance my career in marine conservation, allowing me to contribute more significantly to the field.”
-- Achier Chung, Malaysia
“I was awarded the EFN scholarship for my master’s study at Makerere University in 2016. On a personal level, it was an affirmation of my abilities and potential, significantly boosting my confidence. Professionally, this support enabled me to develop a tool to guide sustainable water allocation in a catchment that had numerous competing users threatening the survival of the voiceless biodiversity. The tool, which has significantly reduced the time required for new water user application assessments has also ensured the retainment of environmental flow in the river system. I have grown in my career, was promoted to a senior position in the Ministry of Water and Environment, and have had opportunities to mentor young conservationists in my team and the sector through the Water Resources Institute and other social forums. I am now a thought leader in the sector and EFN was the catalyst for this incredible journey of personal and professional transformation that has positioned me to make a visible contribution to the sustainable water resources management and development agenda in my country and beyond.”
-- Caroline Ednah Mwebaze, Uganda
“I received funding from EFN in August 2023 to execute my Ph.D. studies and Research at Makerere University in Uganda. The Ph.D. work is a very crucial advancement in my career as a conservationist, researcher, leader, and academic in Africa. The EFN support has thus raised my horizon and capacity as a conservationist; without which it would have been very difficult to pursue my career path. Thank you EFN, I am forever grateful!”
-- Matovu Benard, Uganda
“Thanks to three EFN grants, I was able to refine my scientific journey in conservation by attending prestigious institutions such as the University of Twente in the Netherlands, George Mason University in the US, and AgroParisTech in France. These opportunities equipped me with essential skills and tools while enhancing my credibility within major conservation institutions.
Today, as a result of the EFN support, I am actively involved in national conservation policy development in my country and entrusted with responsibilities that I would not have had access to otherwise. I have also contributed to the establishment of protected areas and the implementation of critical conservation measures in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
I want to express my heartfelt thanks to WWF, the entire EFN team, and Ms. Gonzalez Mercedes for her kindness and continuous support, as well as to all the donors who ensure EFN remains a lasting grant program. I hope EFN continues to benefit future generations as it has for me. It has truly been a transformative force in my career, enabling me to make a meaningful impact in biodiversity conservation.”
-- Mumbere Lango Luc, Democratic Republic of Congo
“In our research on the conservation and management of freshwater species, specifically the species abounding in Lake Kivu, notably Limnotrissa miodon (lake Tanganyika sardine), the EFN program allowed us to perpetuate our program of educating the people surrounding Lake Kivu on its management, particularly in avoiding throwing away plastic waste and overfishing of freshwater species. Thanks to this program, we have initiated plastic waste collection activities on Lake Kivu not only to restore these living environments but also to enable the proper functioning of the Kahuzi hydroelectric power station threatened by plastic waste.”
-- Ntakwinja Kalimbiro Blandine, Democratic Republic of the Congo
“I was first funded by EFN in 2014. I am very grateful to EFN. Nowadays, I work closely with local communities for protection and conservation of environment and natural resources and livelihoods in the context of community protected areas.”
-- Mom Sary, Cambodia
“I am a conservation biologist pursuing a Ph.D. in Integrative Biology at the University of California Berkeley. EFN funded the first two years (2021-2023) of my Ph.D. program, allowing me to dedicate three full semesters to developing my dissertation project. Their support has greatly enhanced my skills in designing research that explores plant-animal interactions and their application in forest conservation and restoration. Additionally, EFN provided me with the opportunity to engage with leaders in the field, fostering both my intellectual and professional growth, while empowering me through the trust they placed in my work.”
-- Veronarindra Ramananjato, Madagascar
“This is a great opportunity that EFN gave me a boost in my career as a researcher and educator in the field of wildlife conservation. I feel very motivated by the arduous path I have taken to get here and I feel that I will be able to generate valuable contributions to the biological conservation and cultural diversity of our planet. Knowing that an organization like EFN believes in young researchers and motivates their professional development is a great responsibility to be part of a group of researchers inspired by the conservation of biological diversity.”
-- Fidel Ernesto Rodríguez Galarza, Ecuador
“Many thanks to WWF and the EFN program for funding my doctoral research and community-based conservation work in the Peruvian Amazon.”
-- Tania Romero Bautista, Peru
“I was awarded an EFN grant in 2020. EFN fulfilled my dream of pursuing the highest degree in conservation science which has completely changed my life for good in terms of enhancing my knowledge, networking with like-minded people from across the globe, and boosting my confidence to speak out in global forums for the biodiversity conservation.”
-- Sagar Dahal, Nepal
