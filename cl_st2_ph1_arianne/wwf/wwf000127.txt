WWF is proud to announce the recipients of the 2024 WWF Russell E. Train Education for Nature (EFN) fellowships.
Fifty-three fellows from 26 countries across the globe who are furthering vital research and conservation efforts to protect ecosystems, guiding the preservation of endangered species, and collaborating with local communities and Indigenous peoples to enhance the stewardship of their natural heritage will receive funding to further their skills and knowledge.
In the 30th year of EFN, we honor the legacy of providing financial support to strengthen conservation science, education, and leadership globally. Over the past three decades, we have witnessed the transformative impact of collaboration, the strength of the EFN alumni community, the steadfast support from our donor partners, and the profound influence of visionary leaders committed to ensuring local leaders gain the skills and knowledge needed to preserve nature.
We are proud to welcome the 2024 cohort to the EFN global network, marking the most significant number of fellows funded in a grant cycle in the history of the program. This achievement is a tribute to the individuals, organizations, and partners who have shared our vision and worked tirelessly to identify practical solutions to biodiversity challenges at local, national, and regional levels. This year’s fellows focus on a broad range of topics, from assessing alternative protein sources as a contribution to sustainable food systems in Mozambique to studying movement and genetic diversity of Nepal’s rhinos and elephants to examining the influence of riparian communities on the Peruvian Amazon freshwater resources.
As we enter the next era, EFN remains committed to growth, while staying true to its vision and inspired by the power of local leaders and communities with the potential for further developing the EFN network and optimizing our funding to support local science capacity and conservation leadership.
Together, we will continue to champion conservation, inspire new leaders, and make a lasting difference in the world. Here's to the next 30 years of conservation leadership!
16 outstanding conservation scientists and leaders receiving the prestigious WWF Train Fellowship for Aspiring and Current Faculty to support their doctorates. This competitive fellowship advances the development of a critical mass of outstanding and well-trained experts, natural and social scientists, and practitioners to increase conservation science and leadership.
22 emerging researchers and practitioners receiving the WWF Trudy Fellowship for advancing knowledge on food transformations. The fellowship supports master’s and PhD research geared towards cultivating a better understanding of the social, political, cultural, economic, and environmental dimensions of food systems in different countries and contexts.
14 emerging scientists and conservation leaders for the inaugural Dr. Gustavo Fonseca Leadership Program . The program aims to provide financial support for the current and next generation of researchers and practitioners in Latin America to pursue graduate-level studies (master’s and PhD) geared towards education and research training that is relevant in the design and implementation of conservation interventions that address conservation challenges.
1 emerging conservation researcher receiving the 2024 Conservation Science Capacity and Leadership in Uganda. The fellowship aims to support conservation leaders and scientists in-country to pursue graduate-level studies (master's degree) with a research focus on developing solutions for human-elephant conflict around the northern border of Murchison Falls National Park in Uganda.
