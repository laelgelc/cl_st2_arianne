April 25, 1945. With war still raging in Europe and the Pacific, delegates from 50 nations gathered in San Francisco to draft the United Nations Charter. That night, President Truman addressed the delegates by radio from Washington, calling them“architects of the better world.”
The horrors of the Second World War serve as a tragic reminder that some threats can’t be contained by borders, and some challenges are too great for one nation—or one organization—to solve alone. That lesson inspired leaders to create multilateral institutions like the United Nations and the World Bank—institutions that have played a crucial role in fostering peace, eradicating diseases, and lifting more than a billion people out of extreme poverty.
Just over 70 years later, the world faces a new threat to shared peace and prosperity. Runaway climate change, like global war, endangers lives and livelihoods across the planet. And, like the threat of large-scale conflict, climate change is a challenge that we can overcome only by banding together.
