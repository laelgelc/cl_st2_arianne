Three playful tiger cubs traipse behind their mother through a forest in Thailand, practicing their roars, in exciting new camera trap footage captured in the Dawna Tenasserim Landscape. It's a delightful result of decades of wild tiger conservation efforts to improve habitat, increase availability of prey, and reduce the threat of poaching across the country.
Last year, Thailand announced that its tiger population is increasing after years of stable population, indicating that tiger conservation efforts are working. This achievement made Thailand the first country in Southeast Asia to increase its tiger population. WWF hopes this success will inspire other governments in the region to invest in their tiger recovery efforts.
This is a critical time for tigers in Thailand. Prey populations are generally low across the country due to historic poaching, but efforts to increase prey numbers, such as Sambar deer, are underway. There's also a growing opportunity for tiger range expansion across the country as tigers move back to places where they used to live.
Continued political support, strong community partnerships, funding, and conservation efforts are needed to ensure these small cubs have the conditions they need to thrive. Now is the time for action.
