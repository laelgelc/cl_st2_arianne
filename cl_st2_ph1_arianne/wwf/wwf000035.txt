Tigers also play a key role in maintaining the health of the forest ecosystems that effectively sequester the carbon emissions that cause climate change. In India, forests inhabited by tigers were found to contain three times the carbon density of forests and other landscapes where the tiger populations were eradicated. Because the presence of tigers wards off human activity, the removal of tigers from landscapes makes the habitat more vulnerable. Without these predatory big cats, humans are much more likely to infringe on the forest, degrading habitats and taking out trees. As a result, the planet loses a major carbon sink, carbon is released into the atmosphere, and warming global temperatures are exacerbated.
As top predators, tigers control populations of other species within their habitats. By preying on herbivores, tigers help keep vegetation in balance for proper ecosystem function and a healthy forest.
Wildlife conservation and climate action are often considered as separate environmental issues, but the two are utterly intertwined. We know that combatting climate change helps save wildlife populations around the globe, but the reverse is also true: wildlife conservation plays an essential role in regulating our climate. By saving wildlife, we help save the planet, including ourselves.
Today, the earth is experiencing its sixth mass extinction event, driven by human activity and subsequent rising global temperatures. The WWF Living Planet Report 2022 found that, in less than 50 years, the world has lost 69% of all mammal, fish, bird, reptile, and amphibian populations. The presence of an abundant variety of life on Earth is critical for the health of our planet. With biodiversity, all species work together within their respective ecosystems to maintain a necessary balance and support life.
Many land animals promote healthy habitats that capture and store carbon to prevent further climate warming. Here are just a few:
