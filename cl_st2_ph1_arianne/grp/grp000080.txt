A selection of images from Greenpeace photographers around the world this week. Comment below and let us know which one is your favourite!
🇺🇸 USA – In response to the growing threat against free speech and peaceful protest, Greenpeace USA lit up Houston with bold projections of resistance and solidarity onto iconic city locations. The projections come three weeks into the $300 million lawsuit brought by Dallas-based Energy Transfer (ET) against Greenpeace USA, Greenpeace Fund, and Greenpeace International.
🇲🇭 Marshall Islands – Welcoming ceremony for the Greenpeace flagship vessel, the Rainbow Warrior in the Marshall Islands, marking the start of a six-week mission around the Pacific nation to elevate calls for nuclear and climate justice; and support independent scientific research into the impacts of decades-long nuclear weapons testing by the US government.
Escorted by traditional canoes, and welcomed by Marshallese singing and dancing, the arrival of the Rainbow Warrior marks a significant moment in the shared history of Greenpeace and the Marshall Islands — 40 years since Greenpeace crew evacuated over 300 people from the Rongelap atoll to Mejatto island, after toxic nuclear fallout from the Castle Bravo test rendered their ancestral lands uninhabitable.
🇲🇽 Mexico – With a public event dedicated to reusable packaging at the Mexican Chamber of Deputies in Mexico City, Greenpeace Mexico shows legislators alternatives to plastic packaging as part of the ‘Oceans without Plastic’ campaign. People from local neighborboods gathered to receive organic soap and domestic products in reusable glass bottles.
🇳🇿 Aotearoa (New Zealand) – Tropical Cyclone Alfred was a major weather event that impacted Southeast Queensland and Northern New South Wales in early March 2025. It began as a tropical low in the Coral Sea on February 20 and rapidly strengthened into a Category 4 cyclone by February 27. The cyclone brought intense rainfall, powerful winds, and widespread flooding to the affected areas. Tens of thousands of people were left without electricity, with more than 112,000 outages reported, especially in the Gold Coast region. By March 10, the severe weather associated with Alfred had subsided, but recovery efforts are still underway. Authorities are urging residents to stay informed through official updates on the ongoing conditions and recovery efforts.
🇺🇸 USA – Greenpeace Africa Executive Director Oulie Keita, at the UN Commission on the Status of Women at the United Nations Headquarters in New York. The 69th Session of the Commission on the Status of Women (CSW69) theme focused on achieving gender equality and empowering women and girls in all contexts—a cause deeply connected to the fight for climate justice.⁣ ⁣ Women and marginalised communities bear the brunt of the climate crisis, yet they are also at the forefront of environmental activism and sustainable solutions.
🇩🇪 Germany – During the political parties CDU and CSU’s preliminary talks on the coalition negotiations, Greenpeace activists draw attention to a gap in climate protection with a two-meter-high “KL_MA” sign in front of the Konrad Adenauer Haus. The future task of climate protection has so far been left out. The missing “I” in KLIMA stands for the lack of ideas and content from the negotiating partners on how the ecological modernisation of the country can be shaped in a socially just way.
🇲🇽 Mexico – Premiere of documentary “Voices of the Mayan Jungle: a struggle for life” at the Museo Memoria y Tolerancia, Mexico City. Representatives of communities on the Yucatán Peninsula who are fighting for their territory were present at the screening and asked the two hundred people who watched the documentary to be sensitive, listen to the voices of the jungle, and join them to protect this critical ecosystem.
Greenpeace has been a pioneer of photo activism for more than 50 years, and remains committed to bearing witness and exposing environmental injustice through the images we capture.
