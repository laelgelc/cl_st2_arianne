One student’s single act of courage has transformed into one of the biggest movements of our times: the school strikes led by young people all around the world.
As one of the biggest climate-related actions the world has ever witnessed, students are fearlessly protesting against all odds in cities such as Kabul, Moscow, Karachi, Ho Chi Minh – bringing the most unimaginable and iconic images of our times. What’s more, with each global strike, school children are bravely stepping up in new cities and joining the fight for our future.
Here’s a tribute to these remarkable heroes around the world, who are the courage that we need during this time of climate emergency. We all must fight to pass on this planet to them in a better state than we found it.
