The summer of 2023 was Earth’s hottest summer since global records began in 1880. This unfortunately marks an ongoing and severely concerning pattern of increasing floods, wildfires, glacier melt, and heat waves in the coming future.
This year, we saw raging forest fires in Canada and many other parts of the world, including Hawaii, the Amazon, Italy, Greece and Indonesia, followed by dangerous floods impacting thousands in India, China, Hong Kong, Greece, Turkey, Bulgaria, Liberia and many countries in Africa.
The worst part is that the end isn’t close enough! There is an abundance of science to say that we absolutely MUST end the fossil fuel industry, but our world leaders need to now ACT on the urgency of the situation.
This year, we finally have a global treaty on plastic pollution, a landmark agreement after years of campaigning and negotiations. Also, Greenpeace activists showcased unparalleled bravery to participate in a courageous protest against deep sea mining companies. This peaceful protest continued for more than 100 hours.
These images below testify to all of our collective courage as we continue to fight for this planet.
