If a giant oil company threatened to build a dangerous pipeline through your backyard, what would you do? For these activists, the answer was simple — take action to stop it.
Yesterday, ten activists peacefully blocked the entrance to a Kinder Morgan construction site in Coast Salish territory near Vancouver, Canada for several hours. Their bold action further delayed the construction of a tar sands oil pipeline that would violate Indigenous rights, threaten clean air and water for thousands of people, and contribute to global climate change.

One of those activists was Greenpeace founder Rex Weyler, who joined the action in solidarity with Indigenous communities to “preserve the ecological integrity of this coast for ourselves and future generations.”

He was joined by Barbara and Bob Stowe, the daughter and son of late Greenpeace founders Dorothy and Irving Stowe, who added, “if our parents were alive today, they’d be standing right here with us.”
But Rex, Bob, Barbara, and their fellow activists who were arrested for standing up to Kinder Morgan yesterday are not alone.
Today’s blockade was just one in a series of inspiring acts of courage opposing Kinder Morgan’s destructive pipeline — and it certainly won’t be the last. Just over a week ago, more than 10,000 people joined a march and rally in solidarity with Indigenous communities to send a clear message of resistance to the oil industry.
Taking down the oil industry, protecting land and water, and defending Indigenous rights is no small task; we’re going to need everyone to step up.
Now is the time to join in solidarity with Indigenous land defenders: sign on to voice your resistance to Kinder Morgan and all tar sands oil pipelines today.
