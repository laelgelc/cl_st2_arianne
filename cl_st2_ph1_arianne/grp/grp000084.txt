The phrase “a seat at the table” is a powerful metaphor for influence, voice, and decision-making. But before we can take our place in boardrooms, legislative chambers, and workplaces, we need to get there—safely, affordably, and without barriers. The journey to empowerment, leadership, and economic independence begins in public spaces, on buses, and in metros—places that should enable freedom, not restrict it.
International Women’s Day was born out of radical movements for labour rights, suffrage, and systemic change. It was never meant to be about pink-washed advertisements or social media posts. Yet, that’s what it has become—a day when brands, corporations, and even those around us embrace shallow empowerment narratives while ignoring the systemic inequalities we’ve all been conditioned to accept.
This Women’s Day, we’re deconstructing mobility as a feminist right. Public transportation isn’t just about getting from point A to point B. It’s about mobility in every sense of the word—economic, social, and political. Mobility is a function of access, and access has never been equal.
When our urban planning and public transport systems have been historically designed with the commuting patterns of upper-caste, able-bodied men and the rich in mind, they choose to exclude women, trans people, and marginalised communities. This is not just about comfort or convenience; it’s about rights, access, and equity.
From poorly lit bus stops to overcrowded public transport, from inadequate first and last-mile connectivity to the looming threat of harassment, these are not just inconveniences but barriers. They limit our participation in the workforce, in education, in public life. They tell us where we can go, and by extension, where we cannot.
In October 2024, we took to the streets of Mumbai and spoke to the women navigating a city that promises upward mobility but systematically denies it to those who need it most. Like most cities in the country, Mumbai’s public spaces are not neutral—they are shaped by caste, class, and gendered privilege. Women in Mumbai spend 21% more on transportation than men just to feel safe, exposing the stark gendered economic burden of mobility. Yet, even after paying this ‘pink tax, ’ only 35% of women feel safe accessing metro stations. This is not just a failure of infrastructure—it’s a deliberate exclusion from the city itself.
But women are reclaiming space. In Delhi, the Pink Ticket scheme , and in Karnataka, the Shakti Scheme , have proven that equitable policies can challenge the status quo . When women occupy buses, trains, and stations in greater numbers, they don’t just reach their destinations—they shift the dynamics of public space itself. More women in public means safer streets, stronger communities, and a challenge to the deeply entrenched norms that dictate who gets to move freely.
Yet, fare-free transport policies for women have often been framed as an unfair advantage despite studies consistently showing that families in India spend less on girls than on boys, not just in education , healthcare and nutrition but also on transport. For many, travel is an economic hurdle.
Women’s mobility patterns are more intricate —they often travel shorter distances but make multiple stops for (unpaid) caregiving, household errands, and work. Yet, public transportation is not designed for these realities. When women stop using public transport because of high costs, it’s not just their independence that suffers—it’s the economy. Women who cannot afford to commute don’t work. They don’t study. They don’t participate in public life. And that lost participation translates to lost wages, lost productivity, and lost economic growth. But access to mobility alone is not enough. Increased ridership must be met with political commitment—better infrastructure, frequent buses, and real safety measures that go beyond tokenism. Gender sensitisation is the bare minimum. It is not just about mobility—it is about power, autonomy, and the right to exist freely in the cities we helped build.
We need cities that move with women, not against them. When we design public transportation with everyone in mind, we incentivise its utilisation by all.
Shifting more people from private vehicles to public transportation reduces carbon emissions, decongests roads, and improves air quality. And when public transportation is accessible and inclusive, it becomes a powerful tool for climate justice.
Our vision isn’t just about making public transport accessible and affordable—it’s about reimagining our cities. It’s about feminist urban planning that caters to the needs of all: women, trans people, the working class, people with disabilities, the elderly, students, and the planet.
Let’s question why access to safe and affordable public transport is normalised as a luxury rather than a right and a basic service for the people. Why aren’t there enough buses? Why are streets unsafe? Why are cities designed for car owners instead of public transport users? Let us recognise that a truly inclusive society isn’t one where women and other minorities are merely present—it’s one where they can participate, contribute, and lead.
A feminist reality isn’t just about who gets a seat at the table. It asks who gets to reach there—who gets to move freely, without fear, without limits, and with agency. And it fights for the ones who can’t.
