🇺🇸 U.S. – Hundreds of protesters and a contingent of Democratic lawmakers rallied outside the Department of the Treasury in Washington denouncing what they called Elon Musk’s “hostile takeover” of federal financial systems, as demonstrations spilled on to, and took over, the street outside the building.
🇩🇪 Germany – Greenpeace activists provide the public information about an ecological wealth tax for the super-rich in 42 cities across Germany, from Munich to Cologne and Dresden. In the run-up to the Bundestag elections, the environmentalists are offering people in pedestrian areas the opportunity to literally send their ‘2 cents’ to the leading candidates of the CDU/CSU, SPD and Greens for the fair financing of future tasks. Two-cent coins can be handed in on the spot with prepared letters calling for climate protection measures to be financed via an ecological billionaire’s tax.
🇸🇳 Senegal – Greenpeace Africa volunteers participate in the Setal Sunu Rew (“Let’s Clean Our Country”) initiative in Dakar, Senegal. Throughout the morning, they dedicated their efforts to cleaning up the city’s beaches, helping to create a cleaner and healthier environment for the community.
They also used the opportunity to share information on plastic pollution and its dangerous impacts on our oceans.
🇵🇱 Poland – Greenpeace Poland activists on kayaks in Gdansk demand an urgent ratification of the Ocean Treaty.
This message is addressed to the Polish government, which has taken over the presidency of the EU Council and is hosting EU commissioners in Gdańsk on this occasion. The main topic of talks in the ECS building is to be the most important actions for the next six months.

🇪🇸 Spain – Greenpeace Spain activists carried out an artistic-performative activity inside the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao coinciding with the International Wetlands Day, to protest against the future expansion project in Urdaibai. Through their performance, the activists sought to represent those animal and plant species that would be particularly affected by this project, many of which are vulnerable species or at risk of extinction.
