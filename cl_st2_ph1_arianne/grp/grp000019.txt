From a protest calling for the protection of the Mayan jungle in Mexico to the 40th anniversary of the bombing of the Rainbow Warrior here are a few of our favourite images from Greenpeace’s work around the world this week.
🇲🇽 Mexico – As part of the campaign “Mexico to the cry of Selva”, activists from the environmental organization Greenpeace Mexico held a protest on Monday morning at the delegation of the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources (SEMARNAT) in Cancun, with the aim of demanding that the agency stop authorizations to exploit banks of stone material in the Mayan jungle, known locally as “sascaberas”.
The sascaberas have devastated close to 10 thousand hectares of jungle, driven by the uncontrolled real estate growth associated with massive tourism and by works of megaprojects such as the Mayan Train.
🇳🇿 New Zealand – The Rainbow Warrior arrived in Auckland, New Zealand to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the bombing of the original Rainbow Warrior and the death of photographer Fernando Pereira. The Greenpeace flagship has just returned from taking action on bottom trawling on the Chatham Rise off New Zealand’s East Coast.
🇩🇪 Germany – Together with the artist duo VIDEO.SCKRE: Julia Heinisch & Frederic Sontag, Greenpeace and the exhibition project HALLENKUNST are creating a mural for more global justice, peace and climate protection over the course of seven days. The occasion is an international campaign by Greenpeace with the inhabitants of the Marshall Islands in the Pacific. The motif of the painting was developed in consultation with the artist Geovannie Johnson from the Marshall Islands.
🇩🇪 Germany – Activists from Greenpeace Germany protest in front of the Reichstag building on the banks of the Spree with a giant inflatable pink octopus (8 x 10 x 5 metres) for the protection of the deep sea. They want to draw attention to the upcoming decisions on deep-sea mining during the annual general meeting of the International Seabed Authority (ISA) in Jamaica. With the inflatable deep-sea animal and banners, the protesters are calling on the German government to oppose the start of deep-sea mining in international waters and to vote in favour of a moratorium.
Greenpeace has been a pioneer of photo activism for more than 50 years, and remains committed to bearing witness and exposing environmental injustice through the images we capture.
