As if fossil fuels weren’t bad enough already. Now Gazprom wants to build the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline through the unique Kurgalsky Nature Reserve .
We can’t let that happen.
Over 38,000 people in Russia have already sent a letter to the Ministry of Natural Resources to defend this precious forest. Send yours here .

This is the planned route of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline
Greenpeace Russia has filed a lawsuit in the Supreme Court to challenge the regulations that have allowed this pipeline to go through. But we need all of you to stand with us against a giant fossil fuel company who wants to destroy this incredible part of the world.
The Kurgalsky reserve is one of the most valuable natural territories in North-West Russia. Many rare plants and animals call it home: the baltic ringed seal, black-throated loon, ruddy turnstone, garden dormouse, peregrine falcon and the golden eagle. Last year, the nest of a white-tailed sea-eagle was discovered here — the rarest predatory bird in this area.
The planned gas pipeline will cut a 3.7 kilometre-long scar through the trees as it passes through parts of old-growth forests. The impact will be irreversible. If it goes ahead, the project will make consumers from Germany, France, the U.K. and the Netherlands unwitting participants in an environmental wrong.
Fossil fuels are one of the most destructive industry on the planet. The world is already shifting towards safer, greener renewable technologies. Don’t let this precious reserve be destroyed for gas.
