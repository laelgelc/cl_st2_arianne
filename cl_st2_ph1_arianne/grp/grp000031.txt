From powerful images from a protest in Jakarta, to the Climate Conference in Bonn, Germany, to cetacean monitoring in Norway, here are a few of our favourite images from Greenpeace’s work around the world this week.
🇩🇪 Germany – The Greenpeace Delegation sent a message at Bonn Climate Conference, calling for stronger action on the 1.5 degree limit.
The Bonn Climate Change Conference took place in Bonn, Germany, 16 June until 26 June 2025. A key moment on the road to COP30 in Brazil, the annual June intercessional meetings (SB62) take place against a backdrop of climate-fuelled disasters and rising deforestation rates in the Amazon.
🇮🇩 Indonesia – Greenpeace Indonesia held a peaceful protest sending the message to “Stop Genocide, Peace Now” in front of the United States Embassy in Jakarta as a form of solidarity with Gaza civilians who continue to be the victims of the worst humanitarian crisis in history.
🇳🇴 Norway – A killer whale and her calf, Orcas (Orcinus orca) are seen during a cetacean survey in the Norwegian Sea from Greenpeace sailing vessel the Witness.
The Witness, a Greenpeace sailing vessel, is on a scientific expedition with a team from Greenpeace Nordic, Greenpeace Germany, scientists and researchers. As part of the Stop Deep Sea Mining campaign the expedition is heading through Norway’s proposed deep sea mining area in the Arctic. The expedition aims to gather data on cetaceans in the designated mining area through passive acoustic monitoring, visual surveys and underwater cameras.
🇺🇸 United States – Greenpeace USA deployed a banner at the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) headquarters to assist in making Uncle Sam’s message to the country crystal clear: this hurricane season, you are on your own.
The message was in response to the Trump Administration’s recent gutting of federal emergency response capacity.
🇸🇪 Sweden – Greenpeace Nordic reminds Energy Transfer of the coming court hearing in Amsterdam on July 2nd 2025. An activist stands with hand banners as the ship ‘Navigator EIRENE’ passes Tjörnbron, Sweden. This ship is transporting fossil gas (LPG) to Sweden from the US terminal Marcus Hook, operated by the controversial pipeline giant Energy Transfer. The hand banners read ‘You have been summoned’, and ‘Wanted in Amsterdam Court, July 2nd’.
Greenpeace International has opposed the American fossil giant Energy Transfer in Dutch court, in response to the fossil giant’s attempt to silence Greenpeace through a so-called SLAPP (Strategic lawsuit against public participation) lawsuit in the US.
🇩🇪 Germany – Greenpeace volunteer groups protest against animal suffering at Edeka by spraying broken hearts and a claim on the ground outside several Edeka supermarkets. The environmental activists demand that Edeka improves conditions for keeping pigs on the farms that supply meat to the German supermarket chain. The claim reads: “Edeka lässt Tiere leiden!” (“Edeka lets animals suffer!”).
Greenpeace has been a pioneer of photo activism for more than 50 years, and remains committed to bearing witness and exposing environmental injustice through the images we capture.
