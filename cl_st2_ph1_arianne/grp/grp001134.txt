No, really, they are!
That’s why government and corporations must do everything they can to break our addiction to fossil fuels now, before it’s too late. And there’s one company sponsoring this year’s Winter Olympics in South Korea, which has the power to transform the global tech industry…
It has a bigger energy footprint than a small country. Less than 1% of the energy it uses to make its products come from renewables, meaning that if it committed to 100% renewables, it would shift the industry and set a global benchmark for others to follow. Now that sounds like a tech leader!
With the support of thousands of people like you, Greenpeace is calling on Samsung’s CEOs to #DoBiggerThings.
That’s why Greenpeace activists all over the world – London, New York, Taipei, Berlin – have been making sure this climate change sponsor gets the message: commit to 100% renewable energy before it is too late.
Despite all its PR talk of “championing the impossible” and “doing bigger things”, Samsung still relies on dirty, old-fashioned fossil fuels like coal to make gadgets.
