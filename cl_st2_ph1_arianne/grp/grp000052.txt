From a powerful protest in Madrid to Berlin and one in Wellington, here are a few of our favourite images from Greenpeace’s work around the world this week.
🇩🇪 Berlin- Greenpeace German activists demonstrate with photos of injured, sick and dead pigs in front of the official seat of the new Federal Minister of Agriculture, Alois Rainer (CSU) in Berlin. On a sign in front of the Ministry, the environmental activists demand: “Your job, Mr. Minister: fight animal cruelty and the climate crisis”. Greenpeace had been sent these images and other photos and film footage from ten pig farms with level 2 standards in North Rhine-Westphalia, Schleswig-Holstein and Lower Saxony.
🇬🇧 United Kingdom — Climate activists and trade unionists join forces outside of Parliament to stand with workers in the face of the UK’s transition away from oil and gas. They demand that a workers’ transition be funded at the upcoming Comprehensive Spending Review. Speakers include Amy Cameron (Greenpeace UK) and speakers from Unite, FOES, RMT, and TUC Aberdeen.
🇪🇸 Spain – Early this morning, Greenpeace activists dyed the water of the three fountains marking the route of the national demonstration in support of the Palestinian people, which will take place tomorrow in Madrid, blood red. (using biodegradable, non-toxic, blood-red dye). With this action, the environmental organization denounces the genocide of the Palestinian people by the State of Israel and demands that the Spanish government impose an arms embargo on Israel. It also encourages citizens to participate in the mobilization, which is expected to bring together thousands of people.
🇳🇿 New Zealand – The “Prime Minister” enjoyed a bowl of pretend poisonous porridge on parliament steps with Greenpeace Aotearoa. The breakfast a attended by a Christopher Luxon lookalike, was to highlight the New Zealand Government’s proposal to raise the legal limit of glyphosate residues allowed in staple grains like wheat, oats and barley – from 0.1 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg – a 100-fold increase.
🇱🇺 Luxembourg – Activists from ASTM, Fairtrade Lëtzebuerg and Greenpeace Luxembourg gathered in front of the European Convention Center in Luxembourg City, carrying out a Photo Op, urging the Luxembourg government to take responsibility within the Council of Europe and support a legally binding protocol on the right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment.
🇷🇴 Romania – On May 9, 2025, Europe Day, Greenpeace Romania activists and staff mobilized for the Pro Europe March to show their commitment to European values and encourage young people to go out and vote in the second round of presidential elections. Amid an electoral campaign marked by ideological polarization, the rise of nationalist and Eurosceptic discourses and uncertainty about the future direction of environmental policy in Romania, Greenpeace’s involvement sends a clear message of solidarity and a call to vote. With statements like “It’s your generation’s moment”, “Democracy is the cleanest environment”, and “we resist, we protest, we vote”, the activists encouraged people to exercise their right to vote with nature and democracy in mind.
Greenpeace has been a pioneer of photo activism for more than 50 years, and remains committed to bearing witness and exposing environmental injustice through the images we capture.
