Our ships are a source of strength for millions of Greenpeacers across the globe. Keeping our tradition, Greenpeace ships and our awesome ship’s crew led and witnessed various campaigns throughout the year. Oceania, the newest addition to the ship’s family, and the Greenpeace Australia Pacific office proved its utility to travel and raise awareness in the remotest locations. Starting from the South Asia tour early this year to the shooting of the iconic music video with singer-songwriters Jacob Collier and AURORA in front of Sveabreen glacier in Svalbard, these images are a small collection of the very busy year our ships have had, documenting and campaigning for a greener future.
