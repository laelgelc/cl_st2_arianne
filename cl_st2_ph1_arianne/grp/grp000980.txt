The sun sets behind the mountains of Dumaguete City, Philippines. The landscape here is beautiful, but it has become a dumping ground for the world’s plastic pollution.
It’s one thing to talk about the plastics pollution crisis, but witnessing it first-hand, standing on it, smelling it, and talking to the communities that have to live next to it, is indescribable.
Southeast Asia is often blamed for the global plastic pollution problem. But these photos expose a hidden truth: the plastic waste that ends up here has primarily been produced in places like Europe and in North America.
In a report published today by the Global Alliance for Incinerator Alternatives (GAIA), Nestlé and Unilever were found to be the top sources of plastic pollution in waste audits done in the Philippines. These and other big corporations are causing communities in countries like the Philippines to be used as a dumping ground through the global waste trade.
Corporations have created a #plasticmonster and they need to take responsibility for it. We need these corporations to take bold and immediate action to phase out single-use plastics for the sake of impacted communities.
While corporations talk, heroes like Froilan Grate and Merci Ferrer are working every day to tackle the plastic pollution crisis with real solutions in the Philippines. I am grateful to have the opportunity to work alongside them as partners in the #BreakFreeFromPlastic movement.
