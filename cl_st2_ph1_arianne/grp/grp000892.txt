We are in a climate emergency, and our leaders may not be acting like it, but we are.
Well over seven million of us have taken to the streets to demand action on climate.
The last two Fridays have seen the biggest climate marches ever . Led by fierce students and school children demanding a future, more people recognise that things need to change.
Protest marches are thriving with creativity, imagination, and energy. This time, from Wellington to Washington and so many places in between we can barely count them all (but it was about 4000), we saw some creations that took serious team efforts to pull off; everything from puppet oil CEOs to more giant globes than we can possibly count.
Here are just a few of the masterpieces that were on display last Friday.
See you at the same time, same place, next week. And every Friday after that until world leaders listen, and unite behind the science.
The next global strike is November 29th. You can find your nearest strike here .
If you haven’t come yet, there is a movement of millions of people ready to welcome you.
If you have, bring a friend.
