A selection of images from Greenpeace photographers around the world this week. Comment below and let us know which one is your favourite.
🇵🇭 Philippines – Filipino communities such as those from the Bohol islands continue to carry the scars of Super Typhoon Odette (International name: Rai). The storm not only destroyed homes and livelihoods but also left lasting impacts on vital aspects of their lives such as job and food security, education, and health. Among these communities is Batasan Island, often dubbed as ‘sinking island” due to rising sea levels and worsening climate change. Recovery has been a slow and difficult process, as families rebuild their lives while grappling with the reality of climate change that makes these disasters more frequent and severe.
🇳🇱 Netherlands – Activists protest in Amsterdam against the biggest meat company JBS’ plans to relocate its corporate headquarters to the Netherlands as part of its listing on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). The protest coincided with Greenpeace International’s lawyers warning JBS’ notaries in the Netherlands that by aiding JBS’s restructuring, law firm Loyens & Loeff risks complicity with a company mired in financial and environmental scandals, and enabling JBS to further expand its environmental-wrecking business model.
🇬🇧 U.K. – A team of 77 activists sets up a protest art installation – titled Breaking Point: Untold Stories of Climate Loss and Damage – around Shell’s London headquarters. The ‘exhibition’ which displays the once-cherished belongings of Filipino communities that were wrecked by climate-charged typhoons that have struck the Philippines aims to highlight how the oil and gas industry is fueling the climate crisis and intensifying extreme weather events that are destroying lives and livelihoods of ordinary people around the world.
🇩🇪 Germany – Considering the third annual day of Russia starting the war against Ukraine, fifteen Greenpeace activists protest against environmentally damaging Russian oil exports using run-down tankers from the so-called shadow fleet on the Baltic Sea off Rostock. From inflatable boats, the Polish, Swedish, Danish Ukrainian and German environmentalists painted ‘RISK!’ in large yellow letters on the tankers’ side as the ‘Prosperity’ passed by.
🇸🇪 Sweden – Activists from Greenpeace and Skogsupproret (Forest Rebellion) halt logging performed by forest company SCA on Ohredahke Sámi community’s land. After having had enough of the forest company’s extensive logging on their reindeer grazing lands, and also discovering that SCA had logged thousands of hectares without consent for several years, Ohredahke Sami community has withdrawn its consent for logging on its most important areas for reindeer grazing. Greenpeace and Skogsupproret continue to patrol the forests of Ohredahke to make sure SCA respects the Sámi community’s decision to withdraw their consent and stop any further logging in their core areas.
🇺🇸 USA – Greenpeace USA brought a powerful visual campaign to the streets of Dallas, projecting messages around Dallas to highlight the growing threat to free speech and peaceful protest.
The projections come just days before Dallas-based Energy Transfer’s $300 million lawsuit against Greenpeace USA and Greenpeace International is set to go to trial. The February 24th trial represents a blatant attempt to silence dissent and intimidate those who fight for climate justice.
🇩🇰 Denmark – Changing Markets and Greenpeace Nordic paid a visit to multinational dairy giant Arla’s headquarter in Aarhus, Denmark, to deliver and launch a new, critical report and ask the dairy giant to step up and take climate action.
‘Dairytales: Arla’s smokescreen for its lack of climate action’ reveals the failure of the to take sufficient steps to mitigate its own emissions, alongside its ongoing efforts to delay and derail wider transformation of the dairy industry and food systems.
Greenpeace has been a pioneer of photo activism for more than 50 years, and remains committed to bearing witness and exposing environmental injustice through the images we capture.
