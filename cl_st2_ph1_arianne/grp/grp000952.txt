They were not protesting against hiked school fees or better jobs. Nor was it a freedom movement or a political rally. Millions of school students took to the streets across the globe for their love for this planet and concern over climate change.
When I was in school, we had no understanding of the extent of climate change, neither were we as smart as these students. I can’t think of another organic movement in history that has achieved this scale and spread across the continents. The clarity of vision, honesty in intention, and their concern for the changing environment is the driving force for the school strikes.
Who would have thought that these so-called millennials, who grew up in a world of tablets and touch screens, where PlayStation took preference over swings and sand castles, would take to the streets and force everyone to listen to them?
These students have mastered the art of old school street protests and have given it a fresh perspective. Creative and to the point, their banners are a delight to read. Yes, this “Instagram generation” who might not have a huge interest in pen and paper, have redefined the art of slogan-writing and banner painting and are a part of history in the making.
These are a few of the best and the most creative banner messages from the student strike.











The best message we ever knew was ‘May the force be with you”.
