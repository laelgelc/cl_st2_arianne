Wonderfilled. That’s the slogan that the self-proclaimed ‘world’s favourite cookie’, Oreo, has been using over the last years.
They have created numerous videos, tv campaigns and even a song about it! But little is known about the dark side of this not-so-wonderfilled cookie… The makers of Oreo, Mondelez, still buys its palm oil from the world’s largest and dirtiest palm oil trader in the world: Wilmar. Its palm oil is associated to several of the suppliers linked to forest destruction and human right abuses in Indonesia.
Italy, Japan, France, Indonesia, you name it! The world is waking up to the fact that there are companies producing palm oil, an ingredient in Oreo cookies, that are still trashing rainforests, and Mondelez is using their palm oil.
Outrageous, isn’t it? Well, Oreo’s dirty secret is not safe anymore. Over the past week, hundreds of Greenpeace volunteers from all over the world have taken to the streets to help spread the word about the destruction behind ‘the world’s best selling cookie’ and its parent brand.
The future of our forests and the lives that depend on them is in our hands.
Over a million people have signed our petition asking Oreo to stop buying palm oil from forest destroyers. Join them!
