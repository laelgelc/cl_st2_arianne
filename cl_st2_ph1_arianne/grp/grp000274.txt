There’s nothing more rewarding than seeing fossil fuel giants crumble under the pressure of our collective action. We live for moments where justice is served, through movements big and small, organized by the most passionate people in the world. While 2023 gave us some grim moments, we remained steadfast in our fight for climate justice, and we will continue doing so in the years to come. To quote Greta Thunberg: “When enough people come together, then change will come and we can achieve almost anything. So instead of looking for hope — start creating it.”
Below are our favorite photos from the actions of our courageous volunteers and activists that will inspire you to take action towards climate justice, wherever you are in the world.
