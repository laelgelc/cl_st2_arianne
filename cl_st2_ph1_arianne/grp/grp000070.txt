From protesting US arms sales to inspecting stolen timber, here are a selection of images from Greenpeace work around the world this week. To see more examples of how Greenpeace uses images to shine a light on global environmental and social injustice, you can navigate to the #Photography tag here on the site, or check out our Media Library .
🇬🇧 U.K. – Greenpeace UK activists pour 300 litres of blood-red dye into the US Embassy pond in London, to highlight the death and devastation caused in Gaza as a direct result of the US’ continued sale of weapons, ammunition and military hardware to Israel.
Twelve activists tipped the non-toxic, biodegradable dye from containers emblazoned with the words ‘Stop Arming Israel’ into the large pond located in front of the embassy building in Nine Elms, south-west London.
🇵🇱 Poland – Greenpeace Poland activists enter the Turow lignite open-pit mine site (South-Western Poland) before dawn and climbed one of the installations, about the height of a 13-story apartment block. They placed a giant banner on the huge excavator that presents a portrait of Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk and the slogans: “Coal is finished. Prime Minister, take care of the people!, Just transition NOW!”.
Their peaceful action aims to urge the Polish prime minister to declare unequivocally the closure of the open-pit mine and power plant of Turów within the next few years. Setting a date for Turow’s closure must be accompanied by a plan for the region’s just transition, which will allow it to obtain all the necessary funds and resources. Without government action in this direction, the region faces collapse and unemployment.
🇮🇩 Indonesia – Activists protest with signs outside the Palembang District Court on April 10, 2025. During the haze lawsuit trial, three expert witnesses gave their statements at the examination session. They provided information on the impact of the haze which has caused severe air pollution in the surrounding areas, and is suspected to have originated from forest and peatland fires in the concession areas of PT Bumi Mekar Hijau, PT Bumi Andalas Permai, and PT Sebangun Bumi Andalas (SBA) Wood Industries—three timber companies controlled by Asia Pulp and Paper (Sinar Mas Group).
🇧🇷 Brazil – In 2025, the 21st edition of the Free Land Camp (ATL) will take place from April 7 to 11 in Brasília at the Funarte Complex. The theme will be “APIB is all of us: In defense of the Constitution and life.” On this occasion, the Articulation of Indigenous Peoples of Brazil (APIB) celebrates 20 years of struggle and resistance.
Greenpeace Brazil has played an active role in the ATL, contributing to the visibility and impact of public demonstrations held during the event.
🇲🇭 Marshall Islands – Majuro atoll in the Ratak (eastern) chain of the Majuro has the largest population of any atoll or island in the Marshall Islands. None of the 29 low-lying coral atolls and the five coral islands in the Marshall group rises to more than 20 feet (six metres) above high tide. The island units of the Marshalls are scattered over about 180,000 square miles of the Pacific. The largest atoll in the group and in the world is Kwajalein, which has a land area of only six square miles but surrounds a 655-square-mile lagoon.
🇸🇪 Sweden – Greenpeace Nordic and Skogsupproret establish a consent and sustainability control station for all timber supplied to Torsboda lumber yard near Sundsvall, Sweden. Despite the fact that Ohredahke Sameby withdrew its consent for logging on their central reindeer grazing lands two months ago, SCA continues to harvest forests in these areas.
🇳🇿 Aotearoa (New Zealand) – Greenpeace Aotearoa activists in Taranaki have occupied the storage facility of Fonterra’s biggest palm kernel supplier and locked themselves to pillars stopping a ship from Indonesia carrying 30 thousand tonnes of palm kernel expeller from unloading.
Meanwhile, another team of activists dressed as orangutan climbed onto the roof of the Agrifeeds facility and deployed a 500 square meter banner that reads ‘Anchor Rainforest Killer’.
The activists are protesting against the use of palm kernel as cow feed on Fonterra farms due to the product’s links to illegal palm plantations and deforestation of paradise rainforests in Southeast Asia.
Greenpeace has been a pioneer of photo activism for more than 50 years, and remains committed to bearing witness and exposing environmental injustice through the images we capture.
