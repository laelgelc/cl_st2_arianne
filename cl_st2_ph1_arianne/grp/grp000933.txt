Last week we received the sad news that one of our great specialist underwater photographers who worked extensively with Greenpeace over the years, Dr. Roger Grace, passed away recently in New Zealand.
Roger was onboard the Rainbow Warrior II in 1990 as it set sail for its first campaign searching for drift netters in the Tasman Sea. In the coming years, he travelled to Antarctica, worked extensively on the Pacific tuna campaign, and scores of other campaigns. He represented a generation of classical photographers. It is difficult to imagine that he could have produced some of the most iconic underwater images with the bare minimum of equipment and technology available in those days. Some of these images are a testimony of his love for marine life and his commitment to the cause of protecting them.
