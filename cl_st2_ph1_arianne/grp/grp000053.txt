From a powerful protest in Bulgaria to one in downtown Tokyo, here are a few of our favourite images from Greenpeace’s work around the world this week.
🇧🇬 Bulgaria – A Greenpeace Bulgaria activist flew over TPP ContourGlobal Maritsa-East 3. The message dropped from the paraglider was “Climate? Fuck it!” The organisation is calling on the government to stop pouring billions into the declining coal industry. Instead, wake up to the climate crisis, care about the future of coal workers and the prospects of the energy poor.
The action comes weeks after a series of extreme weather events led to a state of emergency due to flooding in parts of north-western Bulgaria. It also coincides with months of secret negotiations to sell the ContourGlobal Maritsa-East 3 coal-fired power plant, which was shut down again on 1 April this year.
🇲🇽 Mexico – Greenpeace activists and residents of Santa María Coapan placed garbage bags in front of the Municipal Palace of Tehuacán as a protest to illustrate the waste overflowing from the toxic landfill in their community in the municipality of Tehuacán, Puebla.
🇧🇬 Bulgaria – Under the motto “Neue Gasbohrungen stoppen – am Ammersee und anderswo” (“Stop new gas drilling – at Lake Ammersee and beyond“), around 1200 participants gather to protest the planned gas drilling project in Reichling, Upper Bavaria.
Following a call by Fridays for Future, and supported by the Citizens’ Initiative Reichling-Ludenhausen, BUND Naturschutz in Bayern, Greenpeace Bayern, and Protect the Planet, the demonstration proceeds from St. Nikolaus Parish Church in the center of Reichling to the drilling site approximately 1.5 kilometres away.
🇯🇵 Japan – On 8th May 2025, Greenpeace Japan activists held up a banner that read, “Cut emissions now” in front of Belle Salle Tokyo Nihonbashi in Tokyo, just before the Toyota Motor Corp’s FY2025 financial results press conference began. Toyota has not issued a global target for total emissions reduction, leaving its environmental impact unchecked. In 2023, Toyota’s emissions exceeded those of Germany. Greenpeace calls on Toyota to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions and to decarbonise its production and supply chain in line with the Paris Agreement 1.5°C goal.
🇮🇩 Indonesia – Greenpeace Activists protest with signs outside the Palembang District Court on May 8, 2025. During the haze lawsuit trial, two expert witnesses gave their statements at the examination session. They provided information on the impact of the haze, which is suspected to have originated from forest and peatland fires in the concession areas of PT Bumi Mekar Hijau, PT Bumi Andalas Permai, and PT Sebangun Bumi Andalas (SBA) Wood Industries—three timber companies controlled by Asia Pulp and Paper (Sinar Mas Group).
🇨🇭Switzerland – After just 127 days, Switzerland has used up its natural resources for this year. Greenpeace and students from Zurich University of the Arts are presenting Switzerland with the receipt for its excessive behaviour. At the Lindenhof in Zurich’s old town, they unroll a 70-metre-long receipt with 127 questions. The questions are thought-provoking and provide inspiration for forward-looking solutions.
Greenpeace has been a pioneer of photo activism for more than 50 years, and remains committed to bearing witness and exposing environmental injustice through the images we capture.
