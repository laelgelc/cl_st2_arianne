In 2025, Greenpeace‚Äôs iconic Arctic Sunrise is on a mission across Europe to expose the dirty truth about fossil gas, build a European movement for a fossil-free future, and take action for an EU-wide ban on new fossil fuel projects and a full gas phase-out by 2035.
An open letter to the EU and its member states has already been signed by over 80 thousand people from across Europe who are calling for a ban on all new fossil fuel projects and a full phase out of fossil gas by 2035. This tour sends a clear message to the fossil gas industry and the politicians backing it: people want affordable renewable energy and a safe and healthy environment. Not rising energy bills and dangerous extreme weather caused by climate change.
Fossil gas is not clean. It is a major driver of the climate crisis and a threat to our health and safety. Yet European governments keep approving new gas fields and LNG import terminals, locking us into decades of pollution and high energy bills.
The shift from Russian gas to US gas does not solve the problem either. It just swaps one trap for another. Every fossil gas import from Russia funds Putin‚Äôs war machine, and every gas import from the US opens the door to political blackmail by Trump. This is not energy security. It is dependence on a fuel we no longer need.
The Arctic Sunrise is more than a ship. It is a platform for people power, scientific research, and powerful activism. The ship connects people and causes, provides a space for community-building and gives you the opportunity to become part of the movement against fossil fuels.
This summer and autumn, the Arctic Sunrise opens its doors to the public in six European cities. Come aboard, meet the crew, and learn how we are building a fossil free future together.
