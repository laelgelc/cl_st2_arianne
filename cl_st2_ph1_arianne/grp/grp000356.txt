As we celebrate World Environment Day today, it makes me incredibly proud to be a part of a group of pioneers across the globe – volunteers, supporters, activists, and campaigners – who tirelessly work towards celebrating every day as environment day. Their passion is a strength that inspires us every day to face challenges and not lose focus on the end goal, especially now when all we can see are the impacts of climate change in our backyards almost every day.
You know there is a big problem when seasonal weather changes go beyond the “normal” and into the extremes all around the world, yet the world leaders are ignoring these glaring warning signs.
Last week, Shanghai reported the hottest day in May on record last 100 years. Italy witnessed severe flooding, resulting in widespread damage and more than a dozen deaths. Heat waves and extreme weather events have become a part of our daily lives now, but this shouldn’t be our new normal.
These images below testify to the difficulties faced by people all around the world. They should be haunting enough for us to be even more motivated and ensure we all stand together in this fight against climate change.
