2022 was another difficult year for many of us. The world tried to get back to normal but the meaning of normal has changed for many. This year, we witnessed natureâ€™s fury in full force. Record-breaking heat waves in Europe, Africa, America and China caused wildfires, droughts and deaths, drying up lakes and rivers across the world. Pakistan experienced its worst-ever flooding, submerging one-third of the country and affecting 33 million people.
We are living in a Climate Emergency, and we need to act fast and courageously if we are to save the planet for future generations. With the massive will of activists and volunteers, we can still make an impact and push our governments to take urgent action for humanity.
These images are just a small selection of the courage of the collective will as the people take action. Looking at them, I feel hopeful and inspired by the continued fight for people and the planet.
