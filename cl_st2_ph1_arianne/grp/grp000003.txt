From a demonstration at the plastic treaty in Switzerland to Sydney, in Bavaria, Germany, and a protest in Jakarta, here are a few of our favourite images from Greenpeace’s work around the world this week.
🇨🇭 Switzerland – As world governments meet in Geneva for the Global Plastics Treaty Talks, Greenpeace activists create a symbolic trail of black oil and hang massive banners on the entrance of the Palais des Nations to call out the undue influence of the fossil fuel industry in the negotiations. The action highlights attempts by fossil fuel lobbyists and oil-producing states to prevent countries from agreeing to cut plastic production as a core part of the new treaty.
🇩🇪 Germany – In Reichling, Upper Bavaria, Greenpeace activists are protesting against the planned gas drilling there. They have attached a 2.50-metre-long banner with the slogan ‘No new gas!’ to a five-metre-high bamboo structure at the drilling site.
The activists are calling on the company responsible, Genexco Gas, to stop the gas drilling planned for this month. They are also calling on the Bavarian Minister of Economic Affairs, Hubert Aiwanger (Frei Wähler), not to approve any further gas drilling.
🇮🇩 Indonesia – Activists from Greenpeace, Indonesian Migrant Worker Union (SBMI), and Sumatera Environmental Initiative (SEI) held an action to commemorate Anti-Human Trafficking Day in front of the Transportation Ministry Office and the Coordinating Ministry of Political, Legal, and Security in Jakarta.
🇩🇪 Germany – On the occasion of the 80th anniversary of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the victims are being commemorated. Under the motto “Joined Streetart for Hope”, Greenpeace activists invite the public to help colour in 1,000 cranes on a 2-by-20-meter banner at Millerntor Stadium in St. Pauli.
The artwork originates from the mobile street art wall created by the artist duo Demko/Ebert from Würzburg, and has been expanded with additional cranes and printed on the large-format banner.
🇬🇧 England – Protesters gathered outside the Brazilian Embassy calling on President Lula to veto the so-called “Devastation Bill,” which they say threatens Indigenous rights, weakens environmental protections, and accelerates deforestation in the Amazon. Organised by Brazil Matters, the protest used noise, banners, and symbolic action to draw attention to the bill’s potential impact on biodiversity, Indigenous communities, and the global climate.
🇦🇺 Australia – Tens of thousands march across the Sydney Harbour Bridge, calling for an end to the genocide in Palestine. The ‘March for Humanity’ rally, organised by Palestine Action Group, was estimated to be 300,000 people-strong – one of the biggest protests in Australia’s history.
The protest called for an end to the genocide, sanctions on Israel, an immediate ceasefire, and to let all aid into Gaza. Greenpeace Australia Pacific activists joined in solidarity, carrying a banner reading “Stop the Genocide — Peace now” amid evidence that Israel is starving Palestinians.
🇨🇭 Switzerland – Ahead of the UN negotiations, hundreds of citizens and civil society organisations from across the world gather at Place des Nations in Geneva to demand an ambitious and legally binding plastics treaty that puts people and the planet before polluters. Protesters wear yellow, red and orange to symbolise the urgency of the crisis and the danger posed by the unchecked production of plastic, which is overwhelmingly derived from fossil fuels.
🇲🇾 Malaysia – Greenpeace Malaysia and civil society allies took to the streets demanding Real Funding, Protection, and Accountability for Forests in the 13th Malaysia Plan (RMK13). The peaceful march from Taman Tugu to Parliament ended with activists delivering a memorandum of five demands to Members of Parliament and ministerial representatives.
The event also symbolises a broader call for justice, recognition, and climate accountability for forest protection and Indigenous communities that have long defended Malaysia’s forests while remaining largely excluded from national policy-making despite being on the frontlines of conservation.
Greenpeace has been a pioneer of photo activism for more than 50 years, and remains committed to bearing witness and exposing environmental injustice through the images we capture.
