The last few months have been challenging for humanity. The global pandemic has ushered in a ‘new normal’ for all of us. We hope and pray for better days. For those still affected by COVID-19, we wish them a speedy recovery. This shall too pass.
With lockdowns and social distancing still in place, we are not able to fully explore the world outside just yet. For now, let us be armchair travellers and marvel at just how beautiful and amazing Earth is. From up above snow-clad mountain peaks, down to the deepest depths of the oceans, every inch of our living planet is awe-inspiring. We must celebrate nature’s beauty 365 days of the year.
