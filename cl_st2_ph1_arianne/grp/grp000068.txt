🌍 Global – Around the world, Greenpeace representatives have visited South Korean embassies calling for the release of five Greenpeace International activists who conducted a peaceful protest against plastic production and pollution during the INC-5 Global Plastics Treaty negotiations in Busan in December 2024, and who have since been unable to leave the country.
🇨🇦 Canada – Ahead of a federal election, Greenpeace Canada activists projected powerful messages on the world famous Niagara Falls, including “Don’t Trump Canada”, “Elbows up” and “RESIST”.
Greenpeace Canada is calling out politicians like Trump and Poilievre for spreading fear and division, while polluting industries like oil and gas seek to take advantage of a crisis they helped create. Greenpeace Canada is asking Poilievre and all political parties to protect people and the environment, not polluters and billionaires.
🇧🇷 Brazil – Indigenous people from the Munduruku and Guarani Kaiowá people were received by Minister Gilmar Mendes at the Federal Supreme Court (STF).

This meeting was an important victory for the Munduruku people after the mobilisation that blocked the BR-230 highway in Itaituba, in the southwest of Pará, for two weeks.

🇨🇿 Czech Republic – Greenpeace Czech Republic installed a giant clock made from 750 used PET bottles – some of which the volunteers collected as waste in nature – near the Parliament building in Prague to remind the politicians they promised to introduce a deposit system for PET bottles and aluminum cans but so far they haven’t. And that they are running out of time because the elections are closing in.

🇦🇺 Australia – Greenpeace Australia Pacific Activists stage a ‘hazard clean-up’ activity outside the Liberal Party’s Federal Election launch in Sydney.
