From powerful images from Spain to the South Pacific Ocean, Paris, to a massive protest rally in Brazil, here are a few of our favourite images from Greenpeace’s work around the world this week.
🇹🇷 Türkiye – Protect the Oceans Banner Action in Istanbul
Greenpeace Turkey activists unfurl a ‘Protect the Oceans’ banner in the Golden Horn, calling on Turkey to ratify the Global Ocean Treaty. The Global Ocean Treaty, which received the first signatures in September 2023, is waiting for ratification to be implemented.
Greenpeace, which launched a campaign to protect the oceans before the United Nations Oceans Conference, which will be held in France in June, calls on Turkey to ratify the treaty in the Parliament. Turkey signed the treaty in September 2024.
🇧🇷 Brazil -From the North to the South of the country, hundreds of people mobilised on June 1, 2025, to say NO to Bill 2,159/2021, which radically weakens Brazilian Environmental Licensing and opens the door to deforestation, river pollution and tragedies. With this Bill, companies could declare themselves exempt from environmental licensing without any technical analysis. Volunteers from Greenpeace Brazil in São Paulo were also present at the demonstration on Paulista Avenue.
🇦🇺 Australia – A near-threatened blue shark is pulled up on a Spanish longliner vessel in the South Pacific Ocean. The Rainbow Warrior is in the South Pacific Ocean to expose longline fishing and call on governments to ratify the Global Ocean Treaty and create a network of protected areas in the High Seas.
🇫🇷 France – Greenpeace unfurled a ‘Business is business’ banner, and placed a photo of Emmanuel Macron with Vladimir Putin on Emmanuel’s desk, to denounce France’s double talk on Ukraine and the lack of political coherence in Emmanuel Macron’s actions at Grévin Museum in Paris.
🇮🇩 Indonesia – Greenpeace Indonesia activists, alongside four young West Papuans from the Raja Ampat archipelago, staged a peaceful protest today at the Indonesia Critical Minerals Conference to expose the devastating environmental and social consequences of nickel mining and smelting. The activists deployed a banner reading, “What’s the True Cost of Your Nickel?” and unfurled others with messages: “Nickel Mines Destroy Lives” and “Save Raja Ampat from Nickel Mining.”
The protest extended beyond the conference hall, with Greenpeace Indonesia activists and Papuan youth displaying banners in the exhibition area outside. Messages such as “Nikel Bukan Masa Depan” (Nickel is Not the Future) and “Save Raja Ampat the Last Paradise” were prominently displayed amidst industry booths and attendees.
🇪🇸 Spain – A flock of 800 sheep from the Huesca town of Almudévar joined Greenpeace Spain today, on the eve of World Environment Day, to denounce, with a huge SOS drawn in the ground, the precarious situation of the Spanish countryside and the exhaustion of the country’s unsustainable food system (agriculture, livestock, and fishing, from production to consumption).
Greenpeace has been a pioneer of photo activism for more than 50 years, and remains committed to bearing witness and exposing environmental injustice through the images we capture.
