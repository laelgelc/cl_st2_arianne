ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ U.K. â€“ Activists outside the Royal Courts of Justice in London Demonstrate for the Right to Protest. Greenpeace UK, Friends of the Earth and other organisations join forces outside the Royal Courts of Justice to show their support for 16 Just Stop Oil activists who are appealing against their sentences which total 41 years in prison for peaceful protest. The outcome of this critical legal appeal could have far-reaching implications for the future of all peaceful protest in the UK.
ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡¹ Austria â€“ Sampling water for microplastics at HallstÃ¤dter Glacier. The results of the microplastic analyses show that of the five the glaciers where sampling took place, all are contaminated with microplastics. Thirteen different types of plastics were identified, some of which were extremely specialised.
ðŸ‡±ðŸ‡° Sri Lanka â€“ Protect the Oceans campaign activity with giant octopus and banners at Lotus Tower in Colombo.
ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹ Portugal â€“ Positive example of a private protected area with regenerative agriculture and livestock in Alentejo. Greenpeace has documented some examples of good and bad environmental practices on the occasion of the opening of its new office in Portugal in February 2025.
