🌍 All over the world, Greenpeace supporters stood in solidarity against a ruling in a North Dakota court that found that two Greenpeace entities in the US, and Greenpeace International, would have to pay Energy Transfer, a fossil fuel company, $660 million. The lawsuit is widely considered to be a meritless ‘SLAPP’ (Strategic Litigation Against Public Participation) designed to intimidate critics into silence and to stifle free speech.
🇭🇺 Hungary – Greenpeace Hungary sent a message to the government to fulfil its two-year-old promise to protect the oceans and ratify the global Ocean Treaty. The message was “delivered” with the support of 10 activists who held a 16-metre-long whale in front of the Hungarian Parliament on Kossuth Square.
🇮🇩 Indonesia – A portrait of Hendrikus Frengky Woro (41) from Awyu, at Merauke Solidarity Consolidation in Merauke, South Papua. Hendrikus forms part of the movement of Indigenous Peoples Impacted by National Strategic Projects (PSN) in Indonesia.
🇫🇮 Finland – Greenpeace activists demonstrate outside Stora Enso’s annual general meeting venue in Katajanokka, Helsinki. Greenpeace has submitted an initiative to Stora Enso, demanding that the company develop credible and transparent guidelines to prevent wood procurement from forests with significant natural values.
🇲🇭 Marshall Islands – Majuro Atoll in the Ratak (eastern) chain of the Majuro has the largest population of any atoll or island in the Marshall Islands. Greenpeace is currently on a six-week mission around the Pacific nation to elevate calls for nuclear and climate justice; and support independent scientific research into the impacts of decades-long nuclear weapons testing by the US government in this region.
🇮🇩 Indonesia – Plaintiffs, witnesses, and activists at the Palembang District Court in South Sumatra, wearing masks with stickers that read “Not Yet Free from Smoke”. In this case, thirteen individuals will provide testimony regarding the impact of the haze choking their region, which is suspected to have resulted from forest and peatland fires started by timber companies.
🇧🇷 Brazil – During a field activity with Kayapó leaders, Greenpeace Brazil launched a global campaign in defence of the Amazon, marking the occasion with a large banner reading ‘Respect the Amazon’, unveiled in the northern region of Mato Grosso. The initiative reinforces the commitment to respect the forest and the indigenous peoples who have preserved it for centuries, highlighting the urgency of concrete actions to ensure the survival of this essential ecosystem.
🇮🇩 Indonesia – Greenpeace Indonesia holds a photo-op “Boots to boost justice” using fishers’ boots in Muara Baru fishery port, North Jakarta. This action is part of solidarity with a group of fishers who have filed a suit in the US under the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorisation Act (TVPRA), alleging that they experienced forced labor as they caught tuna that was bought and sold in the US market. This historic suit is the first TVPRA case of its kind.
Greenpeace has been a pioneer of photo activism for more than 50 years, and remains committed to bearing witness and exposing environmental injustice through the images we capture.
