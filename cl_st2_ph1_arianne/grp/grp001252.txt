Next Monday is World Meat Free Day , a great time for all of us to stop and think about the impact of our eating habits on our health – and the health of the planet . Animal agriculture in particular leaves a huge mark on the environment: from water pollution to deforestation to climate change. But the good news is that our everyday choices about the food we eat help change this system.
Whether you are trying out a plant-based diet for the first time or you eat meat-free every day, these recipes from Greenpeace Mexico and Greenpeace ship chef Daniel Bravo Garibi are sure to add some flavor to your normal kitchen routine!
