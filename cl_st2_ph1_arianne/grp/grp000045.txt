From powerful images of the bee farm in Spain to a banner action on the coast of Poland and a peace protest in central Paris, here are a few of our favourite images from Greenpeace’s work around the world this week.
🇩🇪 Germany—Greenpeace activists protested against animal suffering at an event held by the supermarket chain Edeka in Essen. The environmental activists displayed a banner and sprayed Symbols on the ground to draw attention to the contradiction between the suffering in the pig stables and Edeka’s “We love food” marketing.
🇪🇸 Spain -Greenpeace Spain travelled to an apiary in the Community of Madrid to listen to the voice of the fauna and flora of rural Spain. The current food model is unsustainable. That is why, on Environment Day 2025, Greenpeace proposes a Sustainable Food Model (SAM) that puts life before the economic interests of a few.
🇫🇷 France – Greenpeace France, Oxfam France, Amnesty International France, Doctors of the World and Ekō carried out a symbolic action in the heart of Paris, pouring red food colouring into the pool of the Fountain of the Innocents. This operation aims to denounce France’s slow response to the dire humanitarian emergency facing the people of Gaza today.
🇵🇱 Poland – Greenpeace Poland’s activists at the seaside residence of the Polish president appeal to both presidential candidates to support the development of renewable energy, not dependence on fossil gas imports.
🇩🇪 Germany – Greenpeace Germany staff walking through the Lübeck City Forest during springtime.
