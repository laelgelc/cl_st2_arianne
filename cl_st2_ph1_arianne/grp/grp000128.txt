The climate crisis knows no boundaries, and has left its mark on every continent of our planet.
Representatives of Greenpeace at the 29th United Nations Climate Change Conference brought objects and remains of recent climate impacts experienced in Pacific islands, Brazil, the Philippines, Austria, Italy, Belgium, Indonesia, South Africa, Cameroon and Spain.
