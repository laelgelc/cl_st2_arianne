From a powerful projection in California to one in downtown Toronto, here are a few of our favourite images from Greenpeace’s work around the world this week.
🇺🇸 USA – At nightfall in California, Greenpeace USA projected a powerful message of purpose and defiance onto the Marin Headlands, facing the Golden Gate Bridge. The action marked 100 days into the administration’s second term and launched the global #TimeToResist campaign — a call to push back against attacks on democracy, dissent, and environmental justice from billionaire oligarchs and corporate bullies.
🇧🇷 Brazil – Greenpeace Brazil’s activists have taken action against JBS, the world’s biggest meat company, disrupting their annual shareholder meeting at the company’s headquarters in São Paulo. They are protesting the company’s role in environmental destruction and climate breakdown, including deforestation in the Amazon.
🇨🇦 Canada – Ahead of the federal election, Greenpeace Canada’s activists projected powerful messages in downtown Toronto near the CN Tower. Messages included: “Don’t Trump Canada”, “Solar Panels not Pipelines”, “Land Back not Land Grabs”, “Healthcare not Transphobia”, “Peace not War”, “RESIST” and “Time to Resist” among others.
Greenpeace Canada is calling out politicians like Trump and Poilievre, and billionaires like Musk, Zuckerberg and Bezos for spreading fear and division. At the same time that polluting industries like oil & gas seek to take advantage of the crisis they helped create.
Greenpeace Canada is asking Poilievre and all political parties to protect people and the environment, not polluters and billionaires. This projection was also a solidarity statement in support of Greenpeace US, who has been found liable for more than US$660 million in the Energy Transfer SLAPP trial.
🇩🇪 Germany – Greenpeace will be represented at the Evening of Encounter at the Kirchentag 2025 in Hannover with a stand on the topic of the billionaires’ tax. Visitors can vote hypothetically on symbolic 1 billion euro bills on how they would like to use the revenue from a billionaire’s tax for climate protection. The filled-in banknotes will be attached to a 2-metre heart, which picks up on the Kirchentag motto “courageous, strong, courageous”. Engagement-led activity addressing the political power and influence of a small super-rich elite at a mass event in Hannover (the biggest church convention in Germany). #TimeToResist
🇳🇱 Greenpeace Netherlands activists staged a protest at the Council of Ministers with a banner reading ‘See you in court’ to warn about the consequences of failing to meet climate commitments. In October, the Bonaire Climate Case will go to court, in which Greenpeace and residents of Bonaire are suing the Dutch government to demand protection against climate change. According to Greenpeace, the cabinet is stalling—just like it did with the nitrogen crisis—while delay is not an option for Bonaire. Among other demands, Greenpeace insists that the Netherlands must finally meet its own climate target of a 55% reduction in CO₂ emissions by 2030.
🇫🇷 France – Greenpeace France volunteers in Paris support the INC5 warriors “Bring our activists home” – activists from Greenpeace France protest in front of the Consulate of the Republic of Korea and the Eiffel Tower in solidarity with Greenpeace International activists who were forced to stay in South Korea. The action is part of a worldwide campaign in support of the five Greenpeace activists who are on trial for their non-violent campaign against environmental injustice. Five activists from Germany, the UK, Mexico, Taiwan and the Netherlands were prevented from travelling home after a peaceful protest action in November 2024.
🇳🇴 Norway – Time to Resist the Billionaire Takeover – Protest in Svalbard Stop the billionaire takeover protest in Svalbard in front of Mark Zuckerberg’s luxury yacht, Launchpad. During his first 100 days in office, Donald Trump has set about dismantling environmental and climate protections and democratic principles, and attacking those who speak up against the corporate profits of and overreach of his billionaire friends. Billionaires and corporations are taking control of our rights and freedoms. Using their vast fortunes, they lobby to weaken regulations meant to protect people and the planet, fund candidates who serve their interests, and gain control of the media to shape the stories we hear.
Greenpeace has been a pioneer of photo activism for more than 50 years, and remains committed to bearing witness and exposing environmental injustice through the images we capture.
