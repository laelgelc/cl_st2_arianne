This World Environment Day we face the reality that more than 9 out of 10 people globally are breathing unsafe air.
Air pollution is a global health and environmental crisis affecting everyone one of us – every living species which breathes air. So, is it really a day to celebrate? Make June 5 the day you demand your right to breathe clean, healthy air. Demand access to clean energy and a greener environment to live in.
We frequently cannot see the pollution in the air, but its impact on people’s health is visible and cannot be ignored any longer. If the pollution in the air was visible, the world wouldn’t be as pretty. Scroll down to experience the journey of coal energy from a thousand feet below the Earth’s surface to lighting up our homes, but choking our lives.
