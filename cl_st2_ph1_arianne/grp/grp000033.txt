Who is already backing the The Polluters Pay Pact?
People from around the world are experiencing worsening heat, storms, fires and rising sea levels first-hand. Coming together, they refuse to be victims of polluting giants.
Oil and gas corporations have lobbied , deceived and profited as the climate crisis worsens. Now ordinary people, from all walks of life, are doing something truly special. They are uniting around the Polluters Pay Pact to say: governments must recover what is owed from dirty energy companies like, ExxonMobil, Chevron, Shell, TotalEnergies, Equinor, Woodside, Energy Transfer, ENI, or OMV.
Read more about the stories behind the faces, and check back regularly as new voices join the Pact.
These are just a few examples of the people raising the pressure on governments to make polluters – not people – pay for the climate crisis. If enough of us join the Polluters Pay Pact now, we can unite climate-impacted communities, concerned citizens, first responders like fire fighters, politicians, humanitarian groups, economists and campaign organisations so that it becomes impossible for governments to ignore!
There has never been a better time to push for action. Join and share the Polluters Pay Pact now so that we can work together and make this a reality!
