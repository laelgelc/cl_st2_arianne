Greenpeace ships have been the beacon of hope for global environmental justice. They have travelled continuously across seas, documenting the vast diversity of the biodiversity, creatures and people since the first voyage 52 years ago.
This year, our ships have been a part of engaging campaigns all around the globe. In the Pacific, they visited communities at the forefront of climate change to participate in non-violent direct action confronting giant multinational fossil fuel corporations. Our ships have always been a source of pride and inspiration, a continuing support across the shores.
These images below represent a small selection of our brave 2023 to showcase places our ships have traversed to and dropped their anchors to stand up for Mother Earth.
