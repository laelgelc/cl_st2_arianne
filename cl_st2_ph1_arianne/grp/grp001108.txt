The plastic pollution crisis is getting out of hand.
Corporations and retailers are wrapping everything from avocados to t-shirts in throwaway plastic packaging that finds its way into our oceans, all in the name of “convenience.” What’s worse, we know that more than 90% of the plastics ever created have not been recycled — there’s simply too much plastic for us to recycle away the problem.
The result? Ocean plastics are literally choking marine life like turtles, whales, and seabirds to death.
We think the corporations flooding the market with single-use plastics need to do better, and millions of you agree! Over the past few weeks, we asked you to share photos of the ridiculous plastic packaging you come across in your lives using #BreakFreeFromPlastic — and you did not disappoint.

The photos we received (sent in from every corner of the globe) are enough to make any ocean lover scream. But instead of getting angry, let’s get motivated — let’s make 2018 the year we break free from plastic packaging like this!

To fix a problem as large as the plastic pollution crisis, it’s going to take all of us chipping in. You can help keep the pressure on corporations and retailers by sharing your photos of single-use plastic packaging using #BreakFreeFromPlastic and tagging the companies. Then, join the more than one million people worldwide who have signed on to ask corporate polluters to clean up their act.
