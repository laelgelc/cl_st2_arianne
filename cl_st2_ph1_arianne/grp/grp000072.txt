It’s been a busy week in the Greenpeace world, from gambling with the oceans in Bergen, to defending Indigenous lands in Tanzania and a nuclear April fools prank in Geneva. Drop a comment below and let us know which is your favourite.
🇳🇴 Norway – Participants joining an international deep sea mineral conference in Bergen were met by a surprise, as their lobby event had turned into a loud and colourful casino. The message from Greenpeace Nordic is clear: the deep-sea mining industry is gambling with marine life.
🇿🇦 South Africa – Volunteers and staff participated in the yearly Human Rights Festival in Johannesburg.
🇲🇽 Mexico – In front of the Fine Arts Palace in Mexico City, volunteers and staff from Greenpeace México support Greenpeace USA facing a slapp lawsuit from Energy Transfer, an American pipeline company.
🇫🇮 Finland – ‘Meat Head’, campaigning on the streets of Helsinki before the 2025 municipality elections. The activist, dressed in a meat costume, is urging politicians and voters to lobby to make the switch to a plant based food menu to meet climate goals in the municipalities.
🇸🇳 Senegal – Snapshots from International Women’s Day, where women gathered to amplify their voices and advocate for the recognition of their rights. A powerful moment of unity and determination for change.
🇩🇪 Germany – Activists protest in front of the Federal Foreign Office in Berlin and unveil a banner reading: “Leaders unite! Save the planet!”. The banner is unveiled from the top of the ladder of a fire truck in front of the building and calls on the heads of state and government to urgently address the escalating climate emergency.
🇸🇪 Sweden – Ministry of Foreign Affairs staff in Stockholm were met by Greenpeace Nordic activists dressed as sailors and a 6-meter-tall pink octopus, with a giant pen, who urged Foreign Minister Maria Malmer Stenergard to sign the ratification of the Global Oceans Treaty.
🇨🇭 Switzerland – As an April 1st joke, Greenpeace volunteers trick passers-by in Zurich into believing that a new nuclear power plant is being built on the shores of lake Zurich. The campaign coincides with the end of the consultation on the indirect counter-proposal to the blackout initiative. More than 10,000 people took part in a campaign organised by Greenpeace Switzerland, all of whom emphasised that the transition to clean energy is the solution to guaranteeing a secure and independent energy supply.
🇹🇿 Tanzania – Community engagement with Tanzania Maasai, who are facing forced evictions from their ancestral land.
🇬🇧 U.K. – Greenpeace climbers scale the Foreign Office in central London to unfurl a banner calling for faster action on ocean protection. The banner features a cartoon image of a turtle urging Foreign Secretary David Lammy to sign the Global Ocean Treaty into UK law ahead of a major international summit in June; The banner reads “ Lammy Don’t Dally”. Greenpeace uses the protest to highlight the slow pace of action from Lammy, who has made nature and the climate emergency a major theme of his tenure.
