It’s that time of the year again, where we take a moment to step back and have a look at everything that was accomplished in the past 12 months.
2019 was an iconic year where millions mobilised on the streets all around the world to fight for our planet. Corporations and governments were called out for their unwillingness to do their part and do more to save our home. But it was also a devastating year, as we saw ruthless extreme weather events – propelled by climate change – ravaging so many countries. But in the end, it was a landmark year of people power. Despite the adversities, people came and will continue to, come together to continue driving the movement towards a greener, more sustainable, and hopeful future.
On that note, check out a few of the best moments Greenpeace captured in 2019.
