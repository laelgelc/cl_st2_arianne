🇺🇸 U.S.A. – An activist holds up a Resist sign near the Capital One arena as the inaugural ceremonies took place in Washington. Donald Trump was sworn in as the 47th president, promising a “revolution of common sense” and taking charge as Republicans assume unified control of Washington and set out to reshape the country’s institutions.

🇸🇪 Sweden – Sami reindeer roundup, where the reindeers are divided among the villages during the winter season in the Ohredahke Sámi Village in Sweden. Reindeer herding forms the basis of traditional economy for the Sámi and is an integral part of the Sámi identity. Traditional reindeer herding is dependent on expanses of old-growth forest, which provide shelter and the main source of food supply in the form of ground and hanging lichens. The largest forest company in this region, SCA, repeatedly ignore indigenous rights in consultation processes and log old growth forests in areas vital to reindeer husbandry around Ohredahke Sámi village. © Christian Åslund / Greenpeace
