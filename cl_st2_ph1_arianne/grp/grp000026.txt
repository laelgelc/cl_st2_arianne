From a giant banner in Venice, to confronting bottom trawling in New Zealand waters to celebrating the oceans in Mexico, here are a few of our favourite images from Greenpeace’s work around the world this week.
🇮🇹 Italy – Activists from the UK action group Everyone hates Elon and Greenpeace Italy unfolded a giant 20x20m banner reading “If you can rent Venice for your wedding, you can pay more tax” on Piazza San Marco, as Jeff Bezos is due to celebrate his reportedly multi-million wedding in the lagoon city this week.
🇳🇿 New Zealand – Greenpeace Aotearoa activists confront the Talley’s bottom trawler Amatal Atlantis on the Chatham Rise, painting “ocean killer” on its hull to protest destructive bottom trawling.
The Rainbow Warrior is off the coast of Aotearoa campaigning for an end to New Zealand’s destructive bottom trawling in New Zealand waters and the Tasman Sea.
🇲🇽 Mexico – For more than two decades, Greenpeace and other civil society organizations have been seeking a Global Oceans Treaty to protect marine ecosystems from harmful industries, and on June 25, Mexico joined the countries that have ratified this global agreement.
Mexico’s ratification was approved by the Mexican Senate. Now the Treaty will be sent back to the Presidency for its publication in the Official Journal of the Federation and once this is done, Mexico will have to deposit its ratification at the United Nations, thus joining the 60 countries necessary for the entry into force of this international instrument.
🇩🇪 Germany – Greenpeace Germany activists disguise the Edeka meat plant in Lüttow-Valluhn as a crime scene. Five long banners in barrier tape look hang from the roof of the Edeka plant with the warning: “Tierleid und Klimazerstörung” (“Animal suffering and climate destruction”).
Other activists demonstrate with barrier tape at the entrance to the meat plant. A truck in Edeka design bears the modified marketing slogan “Wir lieben Tierleid, deshalb produzieren wir es selbst.” (“We love animal suffering, so we produce it ourselves.”).
🇧🇷 Brazil – During the Parintins Festival, Amazonian culture and resistance come to life in the Bumbódromo arena, echoing the knowledge of the forest to the world. In 2025, at the 58th edition of the festival, the contagious energy of the Caprichoso and Garantido bulls joined a new and urgent call: for an Amazon free of mining.
This year, the Marujada Movement and the Friends of Garantido Movement joined forces with Greenpeace Brazil to transform the crossing to Parintins into a true act of mobilization to defend the forest and its people.
🇮🇹 Italy – Activists from seven countries are taking action with Greenpeace Italy against climate-wrecking fossil gas at the new liquefied gas import terminal of Ravenna. At sea, activists reached the infrastructure and attached large banners on it reading “Burn, baby, burn” referencing President Trump’s mantra “Drill, baby, drill” alongside an image of a burning Earth flanked by the faces of US President Donald Trump and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni.
🇪🇸 Spain – In the framework of the presentation of the Sustainable Food Model presented by Greenpeace, the organisation brings empty boxes of farmers, livestock farmers and fishermen to the Ministry of Agriculture in Spain to demand a change in the unsustainable Spanish agri-food system.
Greenpeace has been a pioneer of photo activism for more than 50 years, and remains committed to bearing witness and exposing environmental injustice through the images we capture.
