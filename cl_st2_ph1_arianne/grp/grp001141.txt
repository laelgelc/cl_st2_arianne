Never have so many penguins been seen waddling in so many places.
They were ice skating in Stockholm, tap dancing in London, trekking up the highest mountain in Turkey and marching on mass in central Tokyo. They were even spotted roaming the deserts of Israel and swimming in the Dead Sea.
Last Saturday (which also happened to be Penguin Awareness Day) penguins across the world stood up in force to support an ocean sanctuary in the Antarctic.
An Antarctic Sanctuary would be a safe haven for penguins, whales and seals. It would put the waters off-limits to the industrial fishing vessels sucking up the tiny shrimp-like krill which Antarctic life relies on. Healthy oceans sustain precious wildlife, help limit climate change and provide food security for billions of people.
You can join the movement here , without having to put on a penguin costume (unless you want to).












There are many names for groups of penguins on land, but a ‘waddle’ has to be my favourite. Help protect their Antarctic home , so that penguins everywhere can continue to waddle forever.
