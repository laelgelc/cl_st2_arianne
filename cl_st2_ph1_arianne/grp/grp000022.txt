From Pride Month celebrations in the Philippines to a massive banner in Spain, here are a few of our favourite images from Greenpeace’s work around the world this week.
🇵🇭 Philippines – Greenpeace activists and volunteers joined the lively celebrations Saturday, June 28, during the annual “LoveLaban” Pride Festival at UP Diliman Campus in Quezon City.
The environmental organization was there to celebrate pride and courage for the environment, to highlight the intersection of queer rights and climate justice, and protest the lack of accountability for those who contribute most to climate disasters: giant oil and gas corporations. Meanwhile, the vulnerabilities of marginalized communities are magnified by extreme weather events, such as when queer individuals are deprived of basic recovery services because of their sexual orientation or gender identities.
This is the fourth year in a row Greenpeace Philippines joined the biggest Pride event in Southeast Asia. This year, the group enjoined LGBTQIA+ advocates and allies to lend their voices to global calls for governments to make polluting corporations pay, through Greenpeace’s worldwide signature collection drive, the Polluters Pay Pact.
🇪🇸 Spain – Activists from Greenpeace Spain today covered the iconic Setas de Sevilla monument with a massive banner, displaying the message: “They are destroying the planet. And you are paying for it.”
The action marked the first day of the 4th International Conference on Financing for Development Conference (FfD4), where Greenpeace is calling on world leaders to push for ambitious commitments to fair new global rules on tax and debt, and to hold billionaires and fossil polluters accountable for the climate change they cause.
🇳🇱 Netherlands – Greenpeace Netherlands activists hang a large banner reading ‘Don’t Go Deep with Trump’ on the front of Allseas’ oﬃce building in Delft, while others place a giant octopus in front of the office. The protest urges the company to reject deep-sea mining and stop working with the US government.
🇬🇧 UK – Leading environmental and human rights groups – Amnesty International UK, Friends of the Earth, Greenpeace and Liberty – launch a nationwide advertising campaign to stand up for the right to protest. The campaign features videos of real protesters on a range of issues holding placards that say ‘I’m protesting in here to avoid arrest out there’. The protesters appear on digital billboards clustered in popular shopping areas in London, Birmingham and Manchester, given free to the campaign as the prize in Ocean Outdoor’s annual Digital Creative Competition.
🇳🇱 Netherlands – People gather outside the New Amsterdam Courthouse holding a banner reading “Energy Transfer, Welcome To The EU Where Free Speech Is Still A Thing” to mark the beginning of Greenpeace International’s anti-SLAPP lawsuit against fossil fuel pipeline company Energy Transfer filed in Amsterdam, The Netherlands.
Greenpeace has been a pioneer of photo activism for more than 50 years, and remains committed to bearing witness and exposing environmental injustice through the images we capture.
