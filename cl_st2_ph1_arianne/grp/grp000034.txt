From powerful images from São Paulo, to the UN Oceans conference in France, to a beautiful projection in Turkey, here are a few of our favourite images from Greenpeace’s work around the world this week.
🇨🇿 Czech Republic – Greenpeace activists from Czechia, Slovenia, Slovakia, Austria and Poland climbed onto the roof of the Tesla showroom building near Prague and unfurled a banner reading “Our world is not your toy #TimeToResist.“ Other protesters placed a three-meter-tall caricature of billionaire Elon Musk and U.S. President Donald Trump in front of the building, depicting them together setting the world on fire. At the same time, activists replaced the company’s flags with ones featuring images of Trump and Musk with the slogan “Stop the billionaire takeover.”
The event is part of a global campaign called Time to Resist, carried out by different organisations from the Greenpeace network across various countries. The campaign is a response to the way billionaires and fossil fuel corporations are openly attacking not only the environment but also civil society. Specifically, U.S. President Donald Trump and his billionaire allies present a threat to NGOs, the media, scientists, and environmental defenders, as they deny or downplay the current climate crisis in public discourse and on social media.
🇹🇷 Türkiye – The United Nations Ocean Conference started on 9 June in Nice, France. On the first day of the Conference, Greenpeace Turkey organised a pixelstick campaign in the Bosphorus to demand the ratification of the Global Ocean Charter. The whales, dolphins and stingrays that appeared in the night view of the Bosphorus aimed to make the call for the ratification of the Global Ocean Treaty visible. Greenpeace Turkey calls on Turkey, which signed the Treaty in September 2024, to be on the side of life at this historic moment by ratifying the Treaty in Parliament.
🇮🇹 Italy – Activists from Greenpeace Italy have unfurled a blood-red banner in the Acqua Paola fountain on the Gianicolo in Rome with the words “Stop the bloodbath in Gaza” and displayed the messages “Save Gaza” and “Stop genocide” to denounce the massacre that has been ongoing in the Palestinian territories for 20 months now, with the complicity of the Italian government.
🇧🇷 Brazil -Greenpeace Brazil took part in the Climate March in São Paulo, protesting against Bill 2159/2021 — widely known as the Destruction Bill. The demonstration brought thousands of people to the streets, marching from Avenida Paulista to Favela do Moinho, in response to the bill’s threat of weakening Brazil’s environmental licensing laws.
As part of the march, Greenpeace carried out an artistic intervention using repurposed materials, drawing attention to the potential impacts of deregulation on critical biomes such as the Amazon. The action was part of the Respect the Amazon campaign and helped strengthen public mobilisation against this major socio-environmental setback.
🇫🇷 France – Nearly a thousand people took part in the Blue March on the Promenade des Anglais on Saturday, 7 June 2025, on the eve of the opening of the United Nations Ocean Conference. A mosaic of nationalities and demands carrying ‘the voice of the people’.
🇫🇷 France – The UN Ocean Conference (9-13 June) is the most significant political moment on oceans since the agreement of the Global Ocean Treaty in 2023. Therefore, in retaliation against Greenpeace ahead of the UN Ocean Conference, the French authorities have banned Greenpeace International’s ship Arctic Sunrise from entering the port of Nice, where the “One Ocean Science Congress” and the UN conference are being hosted. This follows Greenpeace highlighting the weaknesses of the French network of Marine Protected Areas last month in the Mediterranean Sea, in an expedition on board the Arctic Sunrise.
Greenpeace has been a pioneer of photo activism for more than 50 years, and remains committed to bearing witness and exposing environmental injustice through the images we capture.
