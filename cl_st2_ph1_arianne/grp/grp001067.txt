Greenpeace’s Antarctic Ambassadors are leading the call to Protect the Antarctic. They are a group of artists, actors, scientists, explorers and more who recognise the responsibility we all have to protect Earth’s most fragile places. They have dived to the bottom of the Antarctic Ocean, danced with penguins, met with world leaders and spread the word far and wide: the Antarctic needs our help, and it needs it now.
These Antarctic Ambassadors are calling for the largest protected area on Earth: an Antarctic Ocean Sanctuary. This sanctuary would form a safe haven for penguins, whales and seals to recover from the pressures of climate change, pollution and overfishing.
Healthy oceans also help to cycle carbon so we can avoid the worst effects of climate change, and provide food security for billions of people. Wherever we are in the world, what happens in the Antarctic affects us all.
