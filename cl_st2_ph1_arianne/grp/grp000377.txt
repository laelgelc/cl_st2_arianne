I often think about a hypothetical first interaction with an alien civilisation. If they asked about our home planet, I would have a tough time relaying the essence, the beauty and the diversity of this planet to them. It would be no easy task.
The truth is, the uniqueness of Mother Earth is way beyond our current understanding. There are so many other aspects of our planet that we are still trying to study, explore and befriend. Phenomenal is too small a word to describe the coexistence of biodiversity, its surrounding ecosystems, and us humans on this planet.
NASA scientists are trying hard to find a “new” Earth, in the hope of exploring the possibilities of another habitable planet. But what if we directed those resources into protecting and saving the planet we currently live on? For a long while now, ambitions and greed have made us cross the line by exploiting, overusing and polluting what Mother Earth has to offer. We have collectively been breaking the code, which would raise a red flag in any intra-planetary summit!
We still have a chance to make a collective change, starting with our outlook towards our surroundings. The existence of our planet is a miracle, and we should preserve this for future generations.
Still not convinced? Check out these images of our beautiful Earth in all its amazing diversity and tell me that I’m wrong.
