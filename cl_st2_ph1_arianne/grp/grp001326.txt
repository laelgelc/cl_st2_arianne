We cannot sustain life without healthy, thriving forests. That is why Greenpeace campaigns for their protection and on this International Day of Forests, we want to share with you a few reasons why you should help.
Failure to protect forests threatens our homes and livelihoods.
Not only do they absorb carbon, but they store just under 300 billion tonnes of carbon in their living parts. Itâ€™s estimated that deforestation is responsible for 12% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Destroying them will not see that figure reduced.
In the last few hundred years extinction rates have increased by up to a thousand times. This rate could increase further if we do not protect our forests.
70% of the plants identified as having anti-cancer characteristics by the US National Cancer Institute are found only in tropical rainforests.
About a quarter of drugs used in conventional medicines are derived from rainforest plants.
Corporations must clean up their act and governments must enforce strong legislation to protect what forests remain. Today, over 10,000 people are storming Twitter and Facebook under the hashtag #StandForForests to show the world that forests must be protected.
You can take action too. We uncovered widespread forest destruction in the supply chains of consumer goods giant Procter & Gamble. For months now, this company has not responded with a promise to guarantee forest friendly product.
