The message is clear and unified: People around the world are holding the oil industry accountable for the global climate crisis. From the Philippines to Greece , from Russia to Brazil and from Canada to New Zealand , activists placed posters and street art in highly visible public spaces on 31 July to proclaim that climate anxiety , climate breakdown , and climate grief are all “ proudly brought to you ” by the fossil fuel industry.
