🇧🇪 Belgium – On board the Greenpeace ship the Arctic Sunrise and in two inflatable boats, activists from Greenpeace Belgium confronted two LNG tankers arriving in Belgium carrying gas from the US and Russia respectively, in protest of Europe’s continued dependence on fossil gas imports. They unfurled banners featuring Trump and Putin, and reading “Their gas, your cash” to denounce how Europe’s reliance on fossil gas fuels geopolitical instability, while leaving households exposed to skyrocketing energy costs.
🇲🇭 Marshall Islands – Greenpeace representatives and displaced Rongelap community come together on Mejatto, Marshall Islands, to commemorate the 40 years since the Rainbow Warrior evacuated the island’s entire population due to the impacts of US nuclear weapons testing. The moment was marked with a candlelight vigil, speeches from survivors, songs and a celebration dinner to honour our ongoing friendship and commitment to the nuclear and climate justice fight.
🇪🇸 Spain – Greenpeace Spain activists unfurl a massive 66m² banner in front of the US Embassy in Madrid with the message “We will not be silenced” (in Spanish “No Nos Callaran). This is a peaceful protest in support of Greenpeace USA and Greenpeace International, which were found guilty on the 19th by a North Dakota jury ordering them to pay $660 million for their support of the 2016 Sioux-led protests against the construction of an oil pipeline by the oil company Energy Transfer.
🇩🇪 Germany – Specialist campaigner for economic and financial transition, Bastian Neuwirth, holds a banner with the inscription: ‘Tax billionaires, save the climate’. Thanks to tax privileges, the super-rich now pay only half as much in taxes and duties as the middle classes. In doing so, they place a massive burden on the climate and impose enormous costs on society.
🇲🇭 Marshall Islands – Abacca Anjain-Maddison is a former Senator in the Marshall Islands and the Deputy Chief Secretary of the country. She is known for her campaigning against nuclear weapons and nuclear testing and support for greater efforts by the United States to clean up islands it used for nuclear testing. She is the daughter of Marshall Islands ex-senator Jeton Anjain, who reached out to Greenpeace to evacuate his Rongelap community to Mejatto in 1985, after it was poisoned by US atomic bomb test ‘Castle Bravo’.
🇷🇴 Romania – Greenpeace Romania activists at the Ministry of Energy in Bucharest for a symbolic peaceful protest against SLAPP-like calls against climate organisations, holding a WE WILL NOT BE SILENCED banner and symbolic red tape over their mouths.
🇯🇲 Jamaica – Greenpeace’s Louisa Casson and Mariana Andrade deliver a 30m x 1.6m scroll containing over 11 thousand messages of support to the new Director General of the International Seabed Authority (ISA), Leticia Carvalho, in Kingston, Jamaica.
Greenpeace has been a pioneer of photo activism for more than 50 years, and remains committed to bearing witness and exposing environmental injustice through the images we capture.
