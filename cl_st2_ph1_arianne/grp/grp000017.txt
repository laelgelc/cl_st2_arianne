From a deep sea mining protest in Malaysia to activists occupying an LNG import terminal in Greece here are a few of our favourite images from Greenpeace’s work around the world this week.
🇲🇾 Malaysia – Greenpeace Malaysia activists and Malaysian actress Sharifah Sofia hold a banner in front of the deep-sea vessel “Hidden Gem” which is anchored off Brunei Bay in Labuan, Malaysia. The action to take a stand against the deep sea mining industry, an imminent threat that has the potential to cause irreversible damage to our oceans and its ecosystem.
The Hidden Gem, owned by AllSeas and commissioned by mining company, The Metals Company (TMC) in a reckless bid to exploit the ocean floor by mining in international waters. Despite growing global opposition and increasing scientific warnings about the possible long-lasting impacts deep sea mining can result in, TMC is aggressively pushing to bypass international safeguards set by the International Seabed Authority (ISA), to begin operations under outdated agreements pushed forward as part of the Trump administration.
TMC confirmed in late April that they have submitted the first-ever commercial mining application to the US government, with the company stating they are “ready to go”.
🇬🇷 Greece – Greenpeace Greece activists occupy the Alexandroupolis LNG import terminal, located in an on paper protected Natura 2000 area of the Aegean Sea to draw attention to the devastating climate and environmental impacts of fossil gas. As wildfires rage across Greece, activists carried out multiple actions since the morning. Greenpeace is calling for a ban on all new fossil fuel projects in the EU.
🇮🇩 Indonesia – A number of Greenpeace Indonesia activists staged an action wearing full firefighting costumes for forest and peatland fires, carrying banners that read ‘Not Yet Free from Haze’, ‘Restore Peatlands, Save the Climate’, and ‘Forests Not Fires’ at the Fountain Roundabout in Palembang, South Sumatra, Indonesia.
🇿🇦 South Africa – ​​Greenpeace Africa activists hung a giant banner with a photo of South African president Cyril Ramaphosa reading ‘End Financial Apartheid #TaxTheSuperRich’, ahead of the G20’s 3rd Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors’ meeting in Durban. Other activists hold a banner with the portrait of Nelson Mandela.
Greenpeace is demanding the G20 host push ahead on accelerating efforts to impose a wealth tax on the world’s billionaires and to support the UN Tax Convention for new and fair global tax rules.
🇯🇲 Jamaica – A team from Greenpeace International fly huge ocean themed kites together with a banner reading “Protect The Deep Sea” outside the Jamaica Conference Centre in Kingston.
With the International Seabed Authority (ISA) currently meeting in the building. Greenpeace is calling on governments at the ISA to stop deep sea mining before it starts and protect the deep sea.
Greenpeace has been a pioneer of photo activism for more than 50 years, and remains committed to bearing witness and exposing environmental injustice through the images we capture.
