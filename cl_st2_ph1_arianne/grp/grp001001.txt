2018 has been an iconic year for Greenpeace’s ships. The Rainbow Warrior, Esperanza, and Arctic Sunrise has sailed from all corners of the world – from Antarctica to Hawaii, Taiwan to New Zealand, from the dense forest of Papua to the pristine biodiverse Great Southern Reef in Australia.
Our ships have been the flag bearer literally across the globe and have been part of some amazing documentation to really challenging actions.
