Ships have always been at the heart of Greenpeace’s activism. Tirelessly travelling across the globe, our ships are a source of inspiration for millions. 2022 was a special year for us as we bid a fond farewell to the Esperanza and welcomed the Witness to the Greenpeace family of ships, which also includes the Rainbow Warrior and the Arctic Sunrise.

To honour the journey that 2022 has been, let’s look at some inspiring pictures of our iconic ships as they sail the seas on missions, protests and campaigns to protect our planet and fight for environmental justice.
