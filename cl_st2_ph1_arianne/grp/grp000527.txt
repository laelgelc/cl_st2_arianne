I am often asked, what drives me in my fight for the planet? Indeed, it has been difficult and frustrating to see the damage that humans have, and are continuing to, inflict on Earth. Now, more than ever.
As a multimedia editor, I go through many images in a day and every time I see images of nature in all its stunning and surprising beauty, it reinforces in me that this planet Earth, our home, is absolutely worth fighting for.
On this Earth Day, I have picked out a selection of images of Mother Earthâ€™s stunning creations from some of the remotest regions of the planet. I am reminded yet again that nature is the greatest force to preserve and care for. Tell me in the comments below, what motivates you to persevere in your fight for the planet?
