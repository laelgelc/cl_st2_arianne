From widespread flooding in Manila, the Philippines, to demonstrations in front of the Peace Palace in Hague, the Netherlands, to Arctic Sunrise’s visit to Volos, Greece, here are a few of our favourite images from Greenpeace’s work around the world this week.
🇵🇭 Philippines – Greenpeace Philippines activists held creative protests in flooded neighborhoods in Cainta, Rizal and Malolos, Bulacan to spotlight the urgent need for climate accountability. They placed a cardboard depicting President Marcos in floodwaters, and held up banners declaring: “This is the State of the Nation” and “Make Climate Polluters Pay.” As the nation continues to grapple with the impacts of multiple extreme weather disturbances, Greenpeace Philippines is calling on President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. to demonstrate real climate leadership in his upcoming State of the Nation Address by making the biggest contributors to the climate crisis pay their fair share.
🇭🇰 Hong Kong – Typhoon Wipha battered Hong Kong on July 20, 2025, as it passed just 50 kilometres south of the city. The storm’s torrential rains and powerful winds collapsed scaffolding and toppled trees, resulting in more than 33 people being treated for injuries.
🇯🇲 Jamaica—The Deep Sea Conservation Coalition, Greenpeace International, and other organisations and allies will join a ‘paddle out’ at Jamnesia Surf School near Kingston, Jamaica, to call for the protection of the deep sea and to stop deep sea mining before it starts. The participants form the words “NO DSM” with the surfboards on the beach.
🇳🇱 Netherlands – ​​Youth leaders and frontline communities demonstrate in front of the Peace Palace, the seat of the International Court of Justice. The world’s highest court has just delivered a landmark Advisory Opinion on the obligations of States in the face of the climate emergency. The ICJ decision delivers historic protections that strengthen the responsibilities of States under international law. The Court’s decision obligates States to take all measures within their powers to safeguard the right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment.
