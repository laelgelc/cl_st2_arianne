We, the undersigned individuals and organisations, formally express our solidarity with Greenpeace against Energy Transfer’s meritless SLAPP lawsuit.
Peaceful protest and free speech are fundamental human rights that underpin social progress. Energy Transfer’s SLAPP lawsuit against Greenpeace is an abuse of the legal system and a blatant attempt to silence legitimate work to protect people and our planet. The jury verdict in the Mandan County courthouse finding the Greenpeace organisations in the United States and Greenpeace International liable for more than US$ 600 million is outrageous — but NOT the end of this fight. We will not back down. We will not be silenced.
This lawsuit makes allegations that affect people far beyond Greenpeace. It attempts to rewrite the history of the Indigenous-led opposition movement at Standing Rock – by absurdly alleging that Greenpeace orchestrated the entire resistance. It seeks to hold the Greenpeace entities liable for actions taken by unaffiliated and unknown individuals. This could have a chilling effect on anyone engaged in peaceful protest and assembly. It also attempts to sue over justified and protected speech, claiming it is “defamation” to sign on to a letter, along with 500 organisations, which merely echoes the findings of United Nations experts. This is corporate overreach that is part of a disturbing trend of attacks on advocacy and speech around the world.
We will not allow lawsuits like this one to stop us from advocating for a just, green and peaceful future. On the contrary, we will ensure they have the opposite effect, increasing the support for organizations like Greenpeace and strengthening the broader movement for justice.
This legal attack on Greenpeace is an attack on us all. We will not stand idly by. We will not be bullied. We will not be divided and we will not be silenced.
This letter has been signed by 450 organisations, tens of thousands of individuals, and a growing list of public figures. If enough of us speak out, we can stop Energy Transfer’s abusive lawsuit, protect Greenpeace, and defend free speech. Add your name now!
