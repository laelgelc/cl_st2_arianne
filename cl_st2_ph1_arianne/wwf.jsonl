Like most species at the top of the food-chain, wolves have few natural competitors. As a result, they help maintain healthy populations of other animals and even many of the plants that share their habitats. A famous example concerns wolves and Yellowstone National Park. When wolves were removed from the park during the late 1920\u2019s, populations of elk and other prey species surged, which led to overgrazing resulting in negative cascading impacts throughout the greater Yellowstone ecosystem."}

Since then, there has been a notable resurgence of woody plants like willow and aspen. Because of the increase in their food plants, the beaver population in the park has also increased, resulting in healthier wetlands. When researchers documented the cascading effects of wolf reintegration, they found there was about a 1500% increase in larger willows with a greater capability for carbon storage. Additionally, browsing on young aspens dropped to less than 25% in upland areas and under 20% in transitional areas between land and water by 2010, which helped increase aspen growth and recruitment."}

The opposing viewpoints between wolf-advocates and rural communities often create social tensions that reduce opportunities for developing shared goals and strategies. In turn, these conflicts often lead to increased hunting and trapping based on fears that more wolves and increased protections for them will rob producers of resources, including livestock and hunting opportunities.

Today, as has been the case across much of our existence, humans continue to struggle to find ways to co-exist with these powerful animals. And despite successful reintegration efforts in regions like Yellowstone, wolves continue to need our help. To protect them, we must continue to examine our relationships with predators. We can help by funding coexistence programs, which help ranchers and wolves live together more harmoniously, by educating others about the positive impact wolves have on the environment, and of course, by supporting science-based conservation policy and initiatives, like the Endangered Species Act . These conservation efforts safeguard the ecosystems wolves rely upon and provide the necessary training, education, and innovation for communities on the front lines with wolf populations, ensuring a healthier future for all.

This movement allows them to find food, breed, and establish new home territories. When protected areas are connected, they help people too: supporting clean air, healthy soil and freshwater, and creating livelihoods for Indigenous communities. The Palora-Pastaza Corridor spans nearly 800,00 acres (more than 300,000 ha) of tropical forest. The corridor ensures connectivity between the Sangay National Park and the Indigenous territories of the Shuar, Achuar and Kichwa Indigenous Peoples, in the Palora and Morona Santiago provinces. It supports free movement of iconic and threatened species such as jaguars, tapirs, harpy eagles, Andean bears, and many other species. At the same time, it protects the ecological integrity of one of the most biodiverse regions on the planet."}

Human-wildlife conflict, which involves many species of wildlife across the globe, is a nuanced and complex issue that can become even more so when an intelligent animal like an elephant is involved.

The CoP will bring together world leaders who will decide on their collective action to tackle the biodiversity crisis for the next decade. My hope is that the attention this wandering group of elephants have garnered will not only highlight the overarching plight of Asian elephants in this forum and across the globe, but also ensure that the topic of coexistence will remain front and center during these discussions. If wildlife like these elephants are to coexist with people in the long term, specific targets on coexistence must be key elements within the Global Biodiversity Framework of the CBD.

We support a \"middle-ground\" approach that increases farmer access to non-neonicotinoid treated seeds. This agronomic justification method can benefit farmers' bottom lines and the environment. Farmers should have a say in how pests are managed on their lands while being provided with more information and options to move away from ubiquitous use of neonic-treated seeds that harm wildlife, soil organisms, aquatic systems, and humans. WWF also works with many leading food companies in the US to reduce the environmental impact from their crop production and increase biodiversity on their lands."}

As glaciers began retreating northward approximately 20,000 years ago, milkweed\u2014the only food source for the monarch's caterpillar \u2014did the same. Monarch butterflies began following milkweed's range expansion, while retaining the instinct to return south to their ancestral homeland for overwintering. However, today, the insect faces many obstacles that have made its expansive journey increasingly perilous."}

In the 1980s, scientists primarily focused on protecting the species' Mexican roosting sites in the country's oyamel fir forests. In the 1990s, our attention turned to herbicides and Roundup Ready, genetically modified corn (GMO), which has led to a decline in milkweed, the butterfly's larval food source. By the 2000s, climate change and general habitat loss were increasingly cited. However, it wasn't until 2024 that a study revealed that neonicotinoids\u2014a class of neurotoxic, systemic pesticides also introduced in the 1990s\u2014have played an outsized role in the species' decline in recent years. The study, which analyzed 17 years of land use, climate, multiple classes of pesticides, and butterfly survey data across 81 counties in five states across the Midwest found that community-wide declines in total butterfly abundance and species richness, including that of the monarch butterfly, was most strongly associated with the use of neonicotinoid-treated seeds."}

Nearly 100% of field corn and over 60% of soy seeds are treated with these pesticides. Due to neonics' systemic nature, as the plant grows from the coated seed, every part of the plant, from its leaves to its roots, to its nectar and pollen, becomes irreversibly toxic to insects. Adding insult to injury, most of the seed treatment doesn't stay with the seed, but instead leaches into the soil and water, impacting non-targeted vegetation such as wildflowers like milkweed and other important nectar plants, along with bees, deer, songbirds, and even humans. These pesticides also do little to help corn and soy farmers. While they can offer a short window of protection against some pest damage, in many cases, the bad outweighs the good. In fact, they can even decrease yields since they also harm beneficial insects."}

Adding further pressure, farmers who can acquire non-treated seeds from a supplier may be penalized under the supplier's replant insurance policy if their crop fails for some reason, receiving as little as half of the cost to replant their crop. With margins extremely tight for most producers, these pressures make it difficult for them to increase safety for monarchs and other agriculture-adjacent species, even if they would prefer to do so."}

We are supporting improved transparency and active farmer decisions about when and why neonic treatments go on their crop seeds, encouraging such treatments only when pest risk in their fields means the use of neonic seed treatments will be effective. This is called agronomic justification\u2014determining pesticide seed treatments based on a field review of whether there is pest risk that can be addressed by neonics or another pesticide. If such a risk exists, farmers should have access to and use the most effective seed treatment for the pest pressures they face. But if a pest risk is not present, farmers should also have easy access to buy non-neonic-treated seeds. By doing so, they can save on input costs while benefiting the soil, water, people, and wildlife, including the monarch butterfly."}

Arctic peoples now must adapt quickly to change, shifting their hunting seasons and techniques and working with researchers to understand how climate change is affecting wildlife populations so that they can continue to live with marine life in a sustainable way.

Their distribution in the Bering Sea has likely changed in response to long-term changes in climate, expanding and contracting as glaciers advanced and melted, and capitalizing on emerging productivity hotspots, even in the last 50 years. As the northern Bering Sea changes, and the ecosystem restructures, auklets can help us understand how interactions between species are changing, and whether the number of species it can support changes. Auklets may be messengers of distress when their colonies empty out and their chicks starve, but they are also a reminder that not all is lost, and that it is possible to have a successful breeding season after a series of failed ones; it is still possible for us to curb the worst impacts of a warming planet."}

Many people today overconsume, and fast fashion makes it easy to do so. When our clothes are designed to be trendy and disposable, they often end up contaminating the environment with microplastics. Learning about the Great Pacific Garbage Patch made an impression on me and made me think differently about the waste I create. There are so many ways to use what we already have, and I believe there will be more technological innovations that help us recycle textiles. I want people to understand that we can still enjoy fashion sustainably, and we can upcycle clothing to make creative and beautiful pieces."}

The existing protected areas are in dire need of effective management. Meanwhile, a recent study conducted in Gabon and the Republic of Congo revealed that a higher number of large mammals are found in logging concessions certified by the Forest Stewardship Council \u00ae (FSC\u00ae) than in noncertified forests. Sustainability certification is therefore a proven method to protect biodiversity and create economic benefits for communities and governments."}

It illuminated 134 species, including 33 on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, such as the red panda, golden mahseer, dhole, musk deer, and tiger. As another example, while airport x-ray machines routinely scan bags and cargo for security threats, they are not designed to detect smuggled wildlife, leaving many such discoveries to chance. To address this gap, WWF and partners developed a groundbreaking x-ray scanner algorithm that automatically identifies wildlife products without interfering with existing security protocols.

This includes detailed study and analysis of the new specimen and similar organisms, determining the characteristics that make the new species unique, and assigning the species its name."}

These commitments, called Nationally Determined Contributions, or NDCs, represent each country\u2019s plan for how to achieve the goal of the Paris Agreement, which is to limit global warming to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius. Most experts agree that in order to minimize global climate impacts, we must reach a global goal of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050."}

Consequently, each country that agreed to the Paris Agreement submitted its own plan for how it would reduce greenhouse gas emissions from 2005 levels by 2030 roughly a year after the Paris Agreement was adopted."}

Current NDC execution has managed to put us on a trajectory to hit 2.5C to 2.9C degrees of planetary warming, which is well above the level we need to maintain life as we know it."}

The Paris Agreement requires countries to deliver NDCs that increase in ambition over time. This \u201cratcheting\u201d mechanism is one of the key features of the Paris Agreement. NDCs should have plans to close the global emissions gap and collectively achieve 43% reductions by 2030 and 60% reductions by 2035, compared to 2019, and net-zero emissions by 2050. But these reductions will not look the same for all economies. For instance, developed countries are expected to reach net-zero targets sooner, with the understanding that fossil-fuel-based emerging markets will take longer and have fewer resources to transition."}

They should also include all parts of society in a way that is just and addresses environmental justice. For example, many communities across the United States, often Black and brown communities, have experienced higher rates of pollution and fewer investments in clean energy and resilience than their wealthier neighbors. By applying a climate and environmental justice lens to the NDC, we can right that wrong and make sure that all communities benefit from the green economic transition. This also means including city, state, tribal, business and community experiences in the NDC by actively engaging partners. Put more simply, the NDCs should aim to transform the entirety of the country\u2019s economy and should bring everyone to the table to provide input towards the NDC goals."}

One of the big agenda items for COP29 will be setting a new finance goal, which will help ensure that developing countries that are more vulnerable to climate impacts can receive adequate financing to address the challenges they are facing. Look for important discussions around carbon markets and how private capital may be mobilized in ways that maximize emissions reductions, prioritize equity for marginalized and overburdened communities, and ensure that carbon markets are advancing climate goals in a material way and with integrity."}

Without robust commitments and decisive action on all fronts, we will be facing a much more difficult set of choices in the near future. That makes each of these conferences a critical moment that the world needs to pay attention to. In Baku, WWF will be there not only advocating for climate action, but fighting to preserve our natural habitats, and calling for a halt to plastic pollution.

He taught us all to look at the whole and kept us all hungry for solutions that keep intact the places that we treasure, most particularly the Amazon. This prize honors his legacy by celebrating the lives and work of conservation leaders who bring the same kind of rigor, science, and solutions to keeping the Amazon intact. Congratulations to Marc and Bel\u00e9n on this award and thank you both for your dedication to conserving the place we all love so deeply.\""}

As a second-generation Chinese American, I have learned what it means to live in harmony with nature from an early age, seeking wisdom from my parents and grandparents as they cared for the land and our bodies through the many medicinal herbs and plants we grew in our kitchen gardens.

This ecosystem covers around 10% of the surface of the world's coastal zones, but 30% of which have been degraded worldwide over the last 30 years, which is leading to the loss of their ecosystem services and values. This degradation can also lead to a reduction of income to the community of fishers. Therefore, this project seeks to understand the status of the seagrass ecosystem in Ranobe Bay, southwest of Madagascar, while also identifying and assessing the pressures and threats affecting it. Additionally, this project will evaluate the socio-economic values of the seagrass meadows as a fishing zone frequented by small-scale fishers. Raising awareness of this issue in the local community is necessary to improve their knowledge of the conservation challenges facing this ecosystem and to mobilize the community to work,restore, and conserve this habitat."}

According to NASA, nine of the top 10 years for extreme one-day precipitation events have all occurred since 1995. This has also led to longer and more intense flooding seasons, threatening the safety of communities. In 2017, Hurricane Harvey brought more than 60 inches of historic rainfall and catastrophic flooding across southeastern Texas over the course of four days. Two separate studies evaluating Harvey found that human-induced climate change likely boosted rainfall by about 15% and at least 19% , and both concluded that human-induced climate change likely tripled the odds of this extreme weather event. New modelling also suggests that 30 \u2013 50% of flooded properties , up to 50,000 homes total, could have been spared from flooding had there been no climate change."}

The biggest event on the calendar where the global community looks to advance climate solutions is, without question, the \u201cCOP\u201d\u2014 which is the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (the UNFCCC, which produced an international agreement on climate that is often referred to as \u201cthe Paris Agreement\u201d).

If we\u2019re being real, right now things feel pretty dire. The emotional impact of living during a time when climate-related disasters are worsening, and most individuals feel disempowered to do anything about climate change is very real. Climate Week NYC, however, brings a big spotlight to the potential solutions and gives a platform for those who are trying to deliver those solutions from across all segments of society and all sectors of the economy. Last year, the Wall Street Journal noted that a Climate Week NYC agenda of 400 plus events used the word \u201csolution\u201d 245 times. The word \u201cproblem\u201d appeared only six times. The vibe for Climate Week NYC is focused on what people are doing, what\u2019s working, and what could be done with the right resources and commitments. One of the events we\u2019re really looking forward to this year even focuses on envisioning our climate future\u2014encouraging participants to really commit to using this opportunity, where we need to make so much change, as an opportunity to create a more vibrant, prosperous, and just future for everyone. This shouldn\u2019t be a surprise. New York, after all, is a city that was built on the idea that people come here from all over the world to make their dreams real. We\u2019re going to need the kind of ambition and drive that Climate Week NYC fosters if we\u2019re going to beat climate change. WWF-US over the last two years has made a big commitment to Climate Week, with its programming at the NEST Climate Campus, and with other events around both Climate Week and the UN General Assembly.

This leaves mangrove forests vulnerable to deforestation from tourism development, urban sprawl, and real estate speculation. Though removing mangroves without a permit is illegal, developers and landowners often skirt these laws due to a lack of enforcement and inadequate penalties."}

For me, APEX embodies the bridge between AANHPI traditions and modern conservation efforts. It provides a platform for our voices to be heard and for our ideas to flourish, creating a space where we can challenge ourselves, our colleagues, and our industry to do better for marginalized peoples, as well as the nature they\u2019ve tirelessly protected for generations. By highlighting the importance of listening to AANHPI voices, APEX paves the way for a future where conservation is inclusive, just, community-centered, and filled with hope."}

APEX has undoubtedly been the most gratifying, challenging, and creative initiative I have ever been a part of, one that is so deeply personal that I consider this employee resource group an extension of myself, an unapologetic reflection of my roots, my values, and my identity as a first-generation Chinese American. This group has also given me a renewed sense of purpose in my work on the Oceans team, and APEX\u2019s efforts have resonated similarly with many colleagues across unique teams. It continues to serve as an outlet for AANHPI creativity, resource and partnership development, and education across WWF, all of which support the organization\u2019s collective commitment to more diverse, equitable, inclusive, and just conservation. APEX\u2019s contributions to WWF\u2019s organizational culture and vision simply fill me with pride and joy, as I know that our AANHPI community is (and has always been) foundational to the conservation movement."}

While we can\u2019t turn back time, we can make life on Earth as resilient to change as possible. One solution already exists: Mangrove forests are powerful ecosystems that can help us mitigate and adapt to climate change . However, climate change is negatively impacting mangroves, and conservationists need to use improved, climate-informed management to give these coastal forests the best chance to thrive into the future. To support such management, WWF and partners at the University of Queensland, Australia, have developed a new method, known as the \u201cClimate-Smart Mangrove Tool,\u201d to help experts make the best decisions for people and nature\u2019s long-term survival in a changing climate."}

The reason this story stands out is because the community, for generations, has been aware of belugas using the river system to follow salmon as they are spawning. The challenge is that when US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association (NOAA) scientists estimate the beluga population, they fly transecting lines in the open water, but not in-river. So, the overall beluga count was missing a ton of data. The community said, \u2018We know there are a lot of belugas in the river that aren\u2019t being counted.\u2019 So they co-designed a project to test out acoustic monitoring devices in the Yukon River to confirm. Of the 87 days of the study, 83 of those days confirmed the presence of belugas in-river, which is a great example of traditional knowledge adding to Western science, which is important for managing the species for both people and nature.

I lived in a community where discarded waste was bought at a lower cost in the market by the poor. I couldn't help but notice that those with more abundant means had the luxury of choice: a choice to discard, a choice to waste. It was in this experience that I came to the realization that marginalized people have always been the unsung heroes of recycling, while the rich often had the privilege of squandering resources without a second thought."}

I believe that the media has a crucial role to play in this transformation. Shifting the media paradigm to advocate for waste reduction and promote the value of reuse can dramatically reduce household waste. Additionally, incentivizing sustainable consumption through behavioral changes and accessible, affordable, reusable packaging alternatives can be a game-changer.

The polisin\u2019ala also work alongside local communities and ecologists, as well as students from several universities to monitor lemur population trends, behavior, and habitat quality, and to build scientific capacity to protect wildlife. As a result of these monitoring measures, there has been a 60% decrease in the deforestation rate in 2020 compared to 2019 in the Amoron'i Onilahy and an increase in lemur density from 2019 to 2022. The increased lemur density results from adult lemurs moving into Amoron'i Onilahy because it offers a protected space and enough resources to support additional lemurs.Overall, WWF has trained close to 200 patrollers on patrol reporting, awareness, and communication strategies, with 30 trained in 2023. Now, smartphone technology is creating huge advances in our conservation efforts and allows the polisin\u2019ala to use their phones to document and track lemur populations.

However, the populations of yellow-casqued hornbills in Ebo-Forest are declining due to poaching, habitat loss, and fragmentation. Mundi Nnandi Noukou Onella will work with communities to effectively stop the population decline of hornbills. She will undertake research to determine relative abundance, document local knowledge, and determine hornbill responses to habitat disturbances and anthropogenic activities. By understanding how locals perceive hornbills through myths associated with their protection and trade, Mundi will leverage the support from local communities and authorities to develop synergies for better conservation of hornbills."}

However, lack of consideration for the interrelationship between the surrounding local communities and forest resources may undermine the positive outcomes. Keshav Raj Acharya will evaluate the role played by buffer zone community forests (BZCF) in the supply of forest products and biodiversity conservation in the buffer zone of Bardia National Park, Nepal. Specifically, Keshav will focus on assessing the forest cover and quality change, contribution of BZCF in meeting the needs of the local community, and habitat suitability for wildlife occupancy between BZCF and the adjoining national park. Outcomes from Keshav\u2019s work will enable better development of policies to improve human-tiger co-existence."}

Coral communities have been documented living on or near mangroves in Turneffe where conditions such as water chemistry, temperature, and light availability are incredibly variable from reefs. However, there is a gap in understanding the population structures of coral communities within the Turneffe Atoll. Ninon Martinez will investigate the possible connectivity among areas of the atoll and will transplant corals between both mangrove and coral habitats to determine adaptability of the corals to their new conditions. Ninon's work to understand whether these populations are locally adapted or genetically distinct from those on the reef can aid in forecasting shifting coral assemblages and explore coral species abilities to exploit alternative habitats."}

Economic upheaval brought about by the climate, pandemic, and civil unrest has been disrupting rice production, on-farm management practices, and the livelihoods of rural farming households. Further disruptions can threaten regional food security and stability and undermine conservation efforts in rural communities. Phoo Pye Zone will identify the factors constraining rice yields both prior to and amid these crises, with the aim of developing adaptive strategies for enhanced productivity and ecosystem services. Phoo\u2019s work will inform policy and propose sustainable practices, supporting increased rice production, biodiversity, and rural development."}

However, the populations of yellow-casqued hornbills in Ebo-Forest are declining due to poaching, habitat loss, and fragmentation. Mundi Nnandi Noukou Onella will work with communities to effectively stop the population decline of hornbills. She will undertake research to determine relative abundance, document local knowledge, and determine hornbill responses to habitat disturbances and anthropogenic activities. By understanding how locals perceive hornbills through myths associated with their protection and trade, Mundi will leverage the support from local communities and authorities to develop synergies for better conservation of hornbills."}

However, a lack of consideration for the interrelationship between the surrounding local communities and forest resources may undermine the positive outcomes. Keshav Raj Acharya will evaluate the role played by buffer zone community forests (BZCF) in the supply of forest products and biodiversity conservation in the buffer zone of Bardia National Park, Nepal. Specifically, Keshav will focus on assessing the forest cover and quality change, the contribution of BZCF in meeting the needs of the local community, and habitat suitability for wildlife occupancy between BZCF and the adjoining national park. Outcomes from Keshav\u2019s work will enable better development of policies to improve human-tiger co-existence."}

Coral communities have been documented living on or near mangroves in Turneffe where conditions such as water chemistry, temperature, and light availability are incredibly variable from reefs. However, there is a gap in understanding the population structures of coral communities within the Turneffe Atoll. Ninon Martinez will investigate the possible connectivity among areas of the atoll and will transplant corals between both mangrove and coral habitats to determine the adaptability of the corals to their new conditions. Ninon's work to understand whether these populations are locally adapted or genetically distinct from those on the reef can aid in forecasting shifting coral assemblages and exploring coral species' abilities to exploit alternative habitats."}

Ropati, 22, is a graduate of the University of Alaska Anchorage and is currently finishing a degree in anthropology and civil engineering and applied sciences at Columbia University. She is an Arctic Youth Ambassador and works on multiple projects related to climate action and advocacy for Native American involvement in the sciences. Ropati developed an historically accurate sub-curriculum on Indigenous peoples for the Anchorage School District, highlighting the traumatic history of colonization and its impacts on today\u2019s Native communities. She was key in the passing of a policy to allow students of color in the district to wear cultural regalia at graduation and is the co-founder of lilnativegirlinSTEM , a network for Native women and girls in the sciences to share resources and opportunities. Ropati\u2019s research examines the ways that climate change affects plant ecology in Alaska and how this relates to cultural resilience."}

In explaining the ways global warming affects fireweed, a plant native to Alaska, she emphasized that when plants are impacted, so, too, are the Native communities that have a relationship with them, and that climate change\u2019s impacts on Alaska and its people are connected to centuries of trauma because of colonization. She talks about how the long-term oppression of Alaska Natives has wreaked havoc on communities\u2019 infrastructure\u2014both in the physical sense, such as buildings, roads, and fish camps, and in the social sense, such as education, traditional knowledge, spirituality, and interpersonal relationships. This dysfunction, she says, can make the impacts of climate change that much worse. Ropati highlights that only 0.3%-0.5% of science and engineering degrees are held by Native Americans or Alaska Natives, which is significantly lower than the total percentage of this ethnic group in the US. How much better prepared to face climate change could Native communities be, she wonders, if there were more Native scientists and engineers, using Traditional Ecological Knowledge\u2014the ongoing accumulation of knowledge, practice, and belief about relationships among living beings in a specific ecosystem that is acquired by Indigenous people over hundreds or thousands of years through direct contact with the environment, handed down through generations, and used for life-sustaining ways\u2014 alongside Western science? Further, would climate change even be as extreme if Indigenous communities had been able to continue their largely in-harmony-with-nature ways of living without colonization?"}

For example, coral bleaching events from warm, acidified water have been found to affect the behavior and nutrition of reef fish like butterflyfish, which in turn impact the surrounding wildlife and the dynamics of the whole ecosystem. Species that already live in deep, cold waters are disappearing. The Alaska snow crab fishery collapse earlier this year had complex causes, but NOAA confirms that factors related to \"heatwave conditions,\" even as deep as the ocean floor in the Bering Sea, contributed to the die-off. Marine mammals and seabirds are affected, too. There are hundreds of thousands of other non-human species like whales and other marine mammals that feed on migrating fish and other prey species like krill that now have to travel much longer distances to find food, and are potentially experiencing challenges in birthing and rearing their offspring. Bird species that are consumed by subsistence-based communities, like auklets , can also experience mass die-offs as the location of their marine food sources move away from historical locations. And species that rely on sea ice for hunting food, like polar bears, are particularly vulnerable as seas warm."}

In 2023 alone, over 556 bills targeting trans and gender non-conforming people have been introduced across the country.4 Trans health care, art forms, and books have been banned in certain states. The consequences have been devastating. Hate crimes have spiked, with 2021 the deadliest year on record for trans and gender non-conforming people.5 Trans and non-binary people are four times more likely to experience violence, with Black trans women experiencing the largest share.6 And it\u2019s difficult to comprehend that over 50% of trans and non-binary youth in the US have seriously considered suicide.7 The bottom line is that it\u2019s urgent that everyone, particularly allies, speak up against transphobia. You can save lives."}

Facing higher rates of unemployment, harassment, and difficulty finding housing due to discrimination\u2014which, in many states, is still legal\u2014trans and non-binary people are uniquely vulnerable when a wildfire or hurricane strikes. And in the aftermath of a disaster, they have greater difficulty accessing relief services. Following Hurricane Katrina, for instance, two Black trans women were arrested when they used the womens\u2019 showers in a shelter. 8 Climate and environmental justice are deeply intertwined with trans justice; each one necessitates the other."}

Honey bees are non-native insects that were introduced into North America during the 1600s like cows, chickens (1400s), and other domesticated species. Despite what you may have heard, honey bees aren\u2019t likely to go extinct anytime soon (imagine chickens going extinct), so raising honey bees in your backyard, however well-intentioned, may do more harm than good since they horde resources that would normally feed native bees. In fact, as a domesticated species, honey bee numbers are on the rise .

Ninety percent of the world\u2019s 20,000 species of bees, however, are solitary, which means that rather than have a large hive or colony to defend, most bees you encounter are hardworking, single moms. If these solitary bees die in the act of trying to sting you, there will be no one else to collect pollen and nectar for her young. Perhaps you\u2019ll also be surprised to hear that since stingers are nothing more than a modified version of an insect\u2019s ovipositor, or egg-laying structure, only female bees can sting.

The answer is, \u201cnot exactly, or at least not right away.\u201d The truth is while bees help produce many of our favorite foods like delicious fruits and veggies like squash or tomatoes (technically a berry), many crops like corn and wheat are primarily wind- or self-pollinated. So, we would have food, but our diets would certainly be much poorer. However, if bees were to suddenly go extinct there would be a cascading effect that could negatively impact ecosystems on every continent except for Antarctica (the only continent where bees don\u2019t exist). Without bees, which are collectively the world\u2019s most important pollinators, many flowering plants would likely go extinct, leading to erosion, loss of water (that is otherwise pulled into the soil by wildflower roots), and more carbon being released in the atmosphere."}

While it is true that we rely heavily on honey bees to pollinate many crops it is primarily because we grow crops like almonds in massive monocultures that provide little to no food for native pollinators during most times of the year. According to Cornell entomologist Bryan Danforth , \"An individual visit by a native bee is actually worth far more than an individual visit by a honeybee.\" This is because, \"honey bees are more interested in the nectar [for producing honey]. They don't really want the pollen if they can avoid it.\u201d In fact, research has shown that not only do honey bees do a better job of pollination when native bees are present, but bees other than honey bees are often much more efficient pollinators. Bumble bees, for example, can unhinge their wings from their flight muscles and vibrate their bodies at a middle-C, causing pollen to fall from tomato and blueberry flowers. This is a special technique called sonication, or buzz-pollination , which only bumble bees and a few other bee species can do."}

More frequent and more severe extreme events like droughts, floods, and fires, along with habitat degradation, changes in water cycles, and heat stress challenge most animal populations. Those impacts also affect humans and lead to more competition among all life for resources."}

Nature has slowed global warming by absorbing 54% of human-related CO2 emissions over the past decade. And if we reduce deforestation, restore ecosystems, manage forests, help soil store more carbon, and improve farming techniques, nature can absorb even more. Nature offers protection as well. Healthy ecosystems can increase resilience and keep people safer from climate impacts. Coral reefs offer protection from storm surges, along with wetlands and mangroves. Forests also soak up excess rainwater, preventing run-offs, landslides, and damage from flooding."}

This makes the property difficult to manage because it limits a landowner\u2019s ability to demonstrate property rights and get a mortgage or conservation funding\u2014and can even lead to a loss of the property itself."}

This group of owner heirs may also include folks who married into the family and\/or who have inherited property and in no way are blood heirs to the original owner.

Developers of the mine have exploited nearly every legal, governmental, and public relations avenue to keep the project alive. But now a historical decision by Native landowners, in conjunction with a landmark proposal by the US Environmental Protection Agency, could finally end the Pebble Mine project for good. More than 23,000 WWF supporters signed on to encourage the protection of the rivers, streams, and wetlands that support the salmon fishery and a subsistence-based way of life that has sustained Alaska Native communities for generations. And in December, WWF, with partners at The Conservation Fund and other members of the Bristol Bay Victory Challenge, announced the successful establishment of a 44,000-acre conservation easement protecting four of the world's most important rivers for salmon habitat. These easements will permanently protect land owned by the Pedro Bay Corporation, an Alaska Native corporation, and will bisect the road proposed by Pebble Mine developers."}

Surprisingly, even small organisms like oysters can come to our defense . Oysters are keystone species with ripple effects on the health of their ecosystems and its inhabitants. Just one adult oyster can filter up to fifty gallons of water in a single day, making waterways cleaner. Healthy oyster reefs also provide a home for hundreds of other marine organisms, promoting biodiversity and ecosystem balance. As rising sea levels lead to pervasive flooding, oyster reefs act as walls to buffer storms and protect against further coastal erosion."}

These are necessary for healthy floodplain agriculture and fisheries and help reduce the risks from floods and droughts. Deforestation for agriculture and other land uses and forest degradation, due largely to illegal logging, are fragmenting important forest habitats. This means that forests are no longer able to perform the functions that help maintain healthy ecosystems, such as providing food, mitigating carbon emissions, reducing soil erosion, and maintaining healthy waterways. In Latin America, for example, more than half of the jaguar\u2019s original range has been lost due to deforestation, agricultural expansion, and infrastructure development, isolating jaguar populations into individual pockets of land. Lack of connectivity among these habitats makes it difficult for jaguars to breed and seek prey, which increases human-wildlife conflict as jaguars turn to hunting livestock for food."}

They were given the legal right to protect, manage, and use community forests under the 1993 Forest Act. These groups have assisted in the regeneration of the forest, established nurseries, and planted seedlings. By regulating resource extraction and cattle grazing, they have allowed natural regeneration to take place.

Zoonotic spillover, where viruses jump from animals to humans, is the source of most emerging infectious diseases in humans and the likely source of the next pandemic. Much of that spillover is driven by high-risk trade and consumption of wildlife as well as deforestation and the encroachment of human development into spillover hotspots, particularly in the tropics. Working with our coalition partners in the conservation, health, and development communities, WWF helped drive efforts with Congress and the Administration to ensure that addressing these root causes is a key part of the response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We succeeded in getting new funding approved for these efforts and comprehensive legislation introduced, including the Global Pandemic Prevention and Biosecurity Act. We aim to get a bipartisan bill passed this year."}

Not only has this rise in temperature affected the salmon populations, but also other marine life. Near St. Lawrence Island in the Bering Sea lies a cold expanse of water on the Eastern Bering Sea Shelf. The cool water has kept pollock and Pacific cod south of this shelf. But in 2018, the ocean warmed so drastically that the two species of fish had to migrate and feed farther north than normal. Pollock and cod prey on king crab and small fish native to the area north of the Eastern Bering Sea Shelf, and their recent encroachment into northern waters has contributed to the crash of the king crab population. Both the king crab and king salmon populations used to sustain a remarkably successful commercial fishing and crabbing industry, as well as supply food to entire communities. A survey conducted in 2006 found that the average amount of subsistence food harvested per household in the Bering Strait region is over 3,700 pounds per year, with 77.5% of the food gathered being from the ocean.\u00b9 Today, this type of harvest is just not possible."}

In recent years, a lack of sea ice due to a warming planet has opened once impassable waters in the Bering Strait\u2014and with it, a drastic increase in shipping. Routes across the Arctic are significantly shorter than those commonly used today. Current data reflect a significant increase in transits observed in the Bering Strait in the last decade. While only 262 transits were recorded in 2009, that number increased to 434 transits in 2019. These vessels often travel through delicate marine habitats and Indigenous hunting grounds, which increases the risk for collisions with hunters and marine mammals. A collision can result in damage or loss of transported goods, such as oil and natural gas, and a spill would devastate the region. There is little infrastructure available to clean up such a disaster."}

The project, which prioritizes human rights-based conservation, started in 2018 and is now in its final year. To put sustainable forest management back into the hands of the people who rely on the forest directly, the program focuses on knowledge sharing and the distribution of both financial benefits and technical training to local communities through native tree planting."}

The only available water sources come in the form of small, shallow lagoons, known locally as aguadas, and small holes in the rocks where water is naturally stored, called sartenejas \u2014both fed by rainwater. And when rains become erratic, at least in part because of the human-caused climate change, these water stores don\u2019t capture enough rain to sustain themselves through the dry season.

In fact, honey bees ( Apis species) are actually not native to North America but originated in Europe, Asia, and Africa. Bees are incredibly important insects whose pollination services help plants produce some of our most popular foods, like blueberries and squash, and keep ecosystems functioning and healthy. Unfortunately, many species are in real trouble due to pesticide use in agriculture, habitat loss, and climate change."}

One of the very best things that you can do to help out your neighborhood bees is to plant wildflowers that are native to your region . Native wildflowers are especially suited to feed the pollinators that have co-evolved with them. Desert bees do best on desert wildflowers. Mountain bees prefer flowers that bloom at the right times. Even in cities, bees still do best on the original flowers that would have grown there before development. It\u2019s also very important to plant a variety of plants that bloom at different times throughout the season. This will allow bees to always have a food source throughout the time that they are active. There are many sources online for sustainably harvested, native seeds. Fun fact: bees prefer flowers that are colors other than red (most bees can\u2019t see red) so blue, yellow, white, or purple are often their favorites."}

This means that rather than living in a large hive like honey bees do, most nesting bees are hardworking single moms providing nectar and pollen for a few eggs at a time. After she has provisioned food for each egg (in the form of a little round or square loaf that she has molded herself from the pollen that she has collected), the mother seals off the nesting chamber. Once she has completed her work, she will no longer remain with the nest."}

Pesticides come in many forms and some, such as neonicotinoids, are systemic, meaning that they make every part of the plant (including nectar and pollen) toxic to bees. To avoid harming bees in this way, avoid spraying, or if you need to control more pesty insect species, use organic or biocontrol agents. The more habitat you provide for insects in your garden, the more you invite beneficial insects and other invertebrates to appear and control your pests for you. You should also always ensure that any plants or seeds that you purchase were grown organically and without neonicotinoids. Remember, these pesticides never leave the plant and can make the ground that other plants grow in toxic as well for years to come."}

When given sufficient space to roam and spread out, their reproduction rate improves. To support population growth for this species, we needed to find more land so that we could relocate about 20 black rhinos per year, increasing their distribution across South Africa and giving them a better chance to reproduce.

Introducing all the rhinos to a new home around the same time hasn\u2019t resulted in any deaths from post-release fighting. Lastly, the level of protection from poaching in the land block where they are placed must be at least equal to, if not better than, where they came from.

Communities, with support from WWF-Pakistan, have replanted over 24,000 acres of mangroves to improve protection from extreme weather and have increased community knowledge to encourage sustainable use of the ecosystem."}

The different tree varieties compete for dominance depending on how close land is to the sea, how much shade is available, and even how far the water rises during high tide. But this amazing diversity is endangered due to timber harvesting and overexploitation of wildlife. To counter these threats, local environmental leaders from 15 communities across the province work with WWF-Pacific to share knowledge and learn how to best protect mangrove ecosystems. By collaborating and problem solving, communities benefit from healthier mangroves, fish, and shellfish stocks across almost 200 miles of coastline"}

Air pollution and increasing temperatures contribute to cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. An increased frequency of natural disasters like hurricanes and forest fires due to climate change results in injury, death, and trauma. Droughts threaten crops and freshwater access, while floods force large-scale human migration. One growing concern is the impact on nutrition.
